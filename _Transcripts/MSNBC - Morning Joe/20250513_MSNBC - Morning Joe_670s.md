# 'This is an emergency': Joe on why White House, Congress is on notice over airport staffing issues
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo)
*  A shortage of air traffic controllers forced the Federal Aviation Administration to delay [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=0.0s)]
*  flights for several hours yesterday at Newark International Airport. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Now, according to the FAA, as few as three air traffic controllers were scheduled to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=10.64s)]
*  work at the facility guiding planes to and from the airport yesterday evening. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=16.16s)]
*  That is far fewer than the target of 14 controllers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=22.32s)]
*  The New York Post reports that just one air traffic controller and a trainee operated [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=27.08s)]
*  every flight in and out of Newark between 6.30 and 9.30 last night, when up to 180 planes [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  were scheduled to take off or land. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  A New York-based air traffic controller called the situation, pure insanity. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=44.4s)]
*  The staffing shortage is the latest problem to plague the busy airport. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=50.2s)]
*  Following recent communication outages, the CEO of United Airlines sent an email to customers [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=54.68s)]
*  yesterday saying flights to and from Newark are, quote, absolutely safe. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=59.88s)]
*  Also, this morning it appears Newark isn't the only airport suffering from significant [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=66.56s)]
*  issues. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=71.76s)]
*  More than 100 flights were delayed at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=72.76s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=77.6s)]
*  That follows two ground stops on Sunday due to the runway equipment issues and an air [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=78.8s)]
*  traffic control outage. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=84.36s)]
*  And the airport in Austin, Texas saw more than 100 delays on Sunday due to a shortage [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=86.64s)]
*  of air traffic controllers. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=93.92s)]
*  And Joe, I don't think this is the last we've heard of it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=96.44s)]
*  Something has to change. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=99.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=100.8s)]
*  You know, something does have to change. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=101.8s)]
*  And we've all experienced, certainly post-COVID, difficulties flying, especially in the summer [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=103.88s)]
*  months with pilots being pushed out for retirement and air traffic controllers, also many going [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=111.92s)]
*  to retirement. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=119.24s)]
*  The same thing with flight attendants and other people up and down sort of the food [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=120.24s)]
*  chain for the airline industry. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=125.84s)]
*  We knew this was going to be a problem and talked about it post-COVID, but it has gotten [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=128.92s)]
*  so bad now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=132.88s)]
*  Willie, I really, they're going to have to take some extreme measures. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=134.48s)]
*  I know the Secretary of Transportation is meeting the head of the airlines on Wednesday. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=141.04s)]
*  I know they're going to be trying to keep as many flights up in the air as possible. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=146.48s)]
*  I don't think they can do that. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=150.44s)]
*  I don't think they can do half measures right now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=152.72s)]
*  We've had three outages at Newark, three outages. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=155.08s)]
*  The first outage was blamed on a rusted copper coil. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=159.4s)]
*  And now we've had a second and a third. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=166.48s)]
*  They're not talking about rusted copper coils anymore or whatever they were talking about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=168.6s)]
*  because they've got a system that is melting down right now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=174.16s)]
*  And when you only have the New York Post reporting one air traffic controller and one trainee [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=179.08s)]
*  guiding in 160 to 180 planes from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. in one of the nation's busiest airports [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=186.44s)]
*  last night, it's unacceptable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  They're going to have to make very dramatic decisions and they're going to have to be [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=197.16s)]
*  a ton of planes grounded until they get their arms around this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=201.84s)]
*  And it may be several months before that happens, but this is a tragedy that's waiting to happen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=205.76s)]
*  And when you have the head of United saying flights to and from Newark are completely [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  safe, reminds me an awful lot about what the government said about walking around 9-11 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=218.24s)]
*  after 9-11 for those first responders saying, oh, don't worry, the air is completely safe. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=225.84s)]
*  Well, it wasn't. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=231.16s)]
*  And the air is not completely safe now, not only over Newark, but over a lot of other cities. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=232.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I was one of the many, many people who received that email yesterday from [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=238.44s)]
*  the CEO of United Airlines. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=242.48s)]
*  And he went on to explain not only is it safe to go into Newark, but when there are staffing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  shortages to the FAA, when they have their problems, they require the airlines to have [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=248.44s)]
*  fewer flights to manage that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  So therefore you get canceled flights, you get backups, you get all the things that we're [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=255.28s)]
*  seeing at these airports. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=259.04s)]
*  I'm not sure an email from the CEO, though well-intentioned, is going to put people's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=260.76s)]
*  mind to ease when they hear just how antiquated the system is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=264.2s)]
*  And I guess if you're looking for a silver lining in all this, Jim Bandahai, it's that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=268.8s)]
*  sometimes it takes a moment of crisis to actually get something changed. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=273.58s)]
*  We've had Steve Ratner, a pilot on this show many times over the last several weeks talking [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=278.16s)]
*  about a plan that went in place in the year 2000, 25 years ago to overhaul and modernize [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=282.08s)]
*  our air traffic control system to make it safer, to bring it into this century at least. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  And he says only pieces of that have been put in. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=292.88s)]
*  We have not really overhauled the system in the way we should. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's all been thrown into public view here in the last few weeks. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's a real danger, I think, for Trump, for politicians. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, this is the type of crap that the American public doesn't tolerate. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=306.68s)]
*  This is where the presidency, this is where the government is like being a mayor. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=310.88s)]
*  You operate the airline system. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=314.64s)]
*  You just do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=317.0s)]
*  The FAA governs all of this, and it's an interconnected, complicated system. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=318.0s)]
*  And the CEO can send you an email and say, hey, all is fine. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=322.96s)]
*  You couldn't pay me to go through Newark. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=326.4s)]
*  Even if you could convince me that it's safe, everyone knows you're going to probably have [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=328.28s)]
*  a canceled flight or a delayed flight. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=331.92s)]
*  And the fact that it's now spreading to other places, this has to rise to the top of the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=333.96s)]
*  government's agenda. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=339.0s)]
*  You're going to hear from the transportation secretary, but you're about to head into Memorial [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=340.12s)]
*  Day. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=343.28s)]
*  You're about to head into the summer. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=344.28s)]
*  I was just trying to fly out of Bangor, Maine. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=346.32s)]
*  Turns out that they've had to cancel a bunch of flights because they haven't done runway [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=349.12s)]
*  work that should have been scheduled years ago to be done on time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=353.04s)]
*  And if this is happening at a bunch of different airports and screws up travel, it has implications [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=356.96s)]
*  for people's lives, has implications for the U.S. economy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=361.5s)]
*  Jonathan O'Mare, we've again, we've had summers where travel is difficult over the past three, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=366.55999999999995s)]
*  four years post-COVID. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=374.76s)]
*  It certainly got a lot better over the last two years. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  And everybody's known this system's antiquated. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=381.32s)]
*  Everybody's known that you have floppy disks, that they're still using floppy disk. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=384.28s)]
*  And I guarantee you, they're about half of our audience that don't even know what a floppy [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  disk is. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=392.64s)]
*  It's something that you stuck into an old computer back in the 1980s. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=393.8s)]
*  And as Ratner said, they're not electronic. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=398.72s)]
*  They're handing notes often from one air traffic controller to another. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=401.32s)]
*  But we had the greatest safety run from 2009 until January of this year. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=407.48s)]
*  It's just like Congress was asleep at the switch. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=420.92s)]
*  Successive presidents asleep at the switch. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=423.8s)]
*  Treasury secretaries asleep. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=426.40000000000003s)]
*  They can't be anywhere. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  They are on notice. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=429.48s)]
*  The White House is on notice. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  The Secretary of Transportation is on notice. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=433.5s)]
*  Congress is on notice. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  This system is broken. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=440.12s)]
*  And if there is an accident, it is on you as a lawmaker. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  It is on you as a leader for not doing what's necessary right now in this moment of emergency [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=446.4s)]
*  to make things safer and build redundancy. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  So we don't keep hearing about these horrific stories where air traffic controllers go dark [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=458.32s)]
*  for 90 seconds or two minutes with hundreds of planes up in the sky around their airport. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=466.5s)]
*  First to echo Jim VandeHei's spot-on analogy, this is a moment where the president is like [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=474.2s)]
*  a big city mayor. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=478.32s)]
*  If there's a problem, you're tasked with fixing it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=479.32s)]
*  And if you don't, you will be held responsible. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=482.48s)]
*  We saw some of the travel chaos during the Biden administration early on, where he and [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=484.8s)]
*  the Secretary of Transportation at the time, Buttigieg, got a lot of heat because of airport [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=490.0s)]
*  delays. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  And they did. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  They were aggressive. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  They addressed it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, obviously, big picture solutions weren't presented, but things did get a little bit [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  better the last couple years. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=500.56s)]
*  We're now at that moment for the Trump administration. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  We've heard the president a couple times in recent days say, indeed, the system is antiquated. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  We need to fix this. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=510.56s)]
*  It's going to be a priority. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=511.56s)]
*  He didn't offer any specifics, but said they'd be looking to purchase new systems. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=512.56s)]
*  The question is, when does that happen? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=516.4s)]
*  How long does it take to put it in place? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=518.42s)]
*  And what's going to happen in the interim? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  Because as just noted, this meltdown is coming just as summer travel season is starting to [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=522.4399999999999s)]
*  pick up. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=527.86s)]
*  And if we have weeks' worth of images from airports across the country, beyond Newark, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=529.12s)]
*  a flight of that red board saying flights postponed or delayed and canceled, and lines [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=534.92s)]
*  of passengers at terminals, that's going to be a real-world problem for this president [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=541.22s)]
*  and Congress. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  Mika, they're saying right now they're going to act. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  They're saying they're going to find the money to do this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=550.32s)]
*  Well, until they actually do, they're going to be held responsible. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=552.84s)]
*  Well, they are going to be held responsible. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=555.64s)]
*  Mika, listen, this is an emergency. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=557.72s)]
*  We keep hearing the White House calling things emergencies, that the courts don't think are [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=559.52s)]
*  emergencies, that the numbers don't suggest are emergencies. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=564.84s)]
*  This is an emergency. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=568.48s)]
*  And when you're in an emergency like this, you've got to do some things that are out [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=570.1s)]
*  of the box a bit. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  And one of them is, they have a retirement at 56 years of age, which is too young. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=577.9s)]
*  I don't know if that's because of the union. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=583.24s)]
*  I don't know if that's to encourage younger people to get in so they have jobs for younger [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=585.24s)]
*  people and they can keep moving people up. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=589.4s)]
*  They have to. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=591.7199999999999s)]
*  This is an emergency. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=592.8199999999999s)]
*  They have to get the best and most experienced air traffic controllers back. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=594.04s)]
*  They have to pay them a lot more than they've paid them in the past. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=599.8s)]
*  And they need to move that retirement age up to 60 or 62. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=603.28s)]
*  And they have to do it immediately. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=607.5799999999999s)]
*  Again, when it's a New York Post is reporting, you have one air traffic controller handling [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=609.56s)]
*  160 to 180 planes at Newark from 6 to 9 p.m. last night. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=614.64s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=622.0s)]
*  This is something that can't go through committees. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=623.0s)]
*  This is an emergency and they need to act like it's an emergency. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=625.4s)]
*  And the first thing they need to do is get more air traffic controllers in the tower, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=629.24s)]
*  get people that are not only already trained but have decades of experience and put them [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=633.68s)]
*  up there now. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=639.08s)]
*  Well, I hate to say it. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=640.08s)]
*  I think it starts with limiting the number of flights until they can do that. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=641.32s)]
*  They have to do that. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=645.84s)]
*  Yeah, they have to do that too. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=646.84s)]
*  A lot. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x70db9KdqKo&t=648.6s)]
