# New York City mayor's race tightens as candidate makes gains
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg)
*  Beautiful shot there from EarthCamp, one Vanderbilt looking north midtown Manhattan across Central [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=0.0s)]
*  Park. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=7.8s)]
*  It has been so rainy here in New York. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=8.8s)]
*  I think this is our first nice day since 2021. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=11.4s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=15.16s)]
*  The first debate of the New York City mayoral Democratic primary will be held this Wednesday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=16.16s)]
*  Nine candidates in the crowded field have qualified to take the stage, including former [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=21.0s)]
*  who is looking to make his political comeback in this race. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=26.4s)]
*  Joining us now, New York City Assemblyman and one of the candidates for New York City [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  mayor Zoran Mamdani. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=34.16s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here this morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=37.2s)]
*  Your candidacy has truly surged. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=39.96s)]
*  It is a crowded field, as just noted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=42.84s)]
*  For a few months now, you've been pretty friendly lodged in second place. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=45.06s)]
*  A gap that was once about 30 to 40 points behind Cuomo. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=48.84s)]
*  Now down to about nine or 10. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=53.4s)]
*  So still a deficit, but smaller than it was. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=54.96s)]
*  But as voters start to get to know you, they know Andrew Cuomo. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=59.28s)]
*  What's your pitch? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=62.2s)]
*  You know, I tell them what they already know, which is that we live in the most expensive [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=63.2s)]
*  city in the United States of America. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=66.64s)]
*  And it's a city that used to be one of dreams that is now just one of struggle. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=68.82s)]
*  And we're seeing one in four New Yorkers living in poverty and so many living in this permanent [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=72.4s)]
*  state of anxiety. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=76.44s)]
*  And this is a campaign looking to make the city affordable for the very working class [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=77.76s)]
*  New Yorkers who built it, who today are being pushed out of it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=81.68s)]
*  So a lot of that sounds familiar to what Mayor Bill de Blasio ran on in 2013. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=84.46s)]
*  A Tale of Two Cities was his slogan, suggesting that it was unaffordable for most. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  What makes you think, what are your concrete plans that are going to be successful when [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  perhaps some of your predecessors were not? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=99.94s)]
*  You know, we've sketched it out because what New Yorkers deserve is a plan that actually [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=102.17999999999999s)]
*  speaks to the crisis in their lives. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=106.28s)]
*  And affordability is the number one crisis. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  So we're going to freeze the rent for more than two million New Yorkers who live in rent [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=109.82s)]
*  stabilized housing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=112.82s)]
*  We're going to make the slowest buses in the nation fast and free. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=114.14s)]
*  And we're going to deliver universal child care to each and every New Yorker, whether [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=117.06s)]
*  their child is six weeks or five years of age, because today child care is the number [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  two reason people are leaving our city. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=124.72s)]
*  And it makes sense. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=126.9s)]
*  It costs $25,000 a year to raise a kid here, which is more money than it would cost to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=127.9s)]
*  send that same kid to CUNY 18 years later. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=132.02s)]
*  So the Working Families Party, which has certainly credentials on the left, released its ranked [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=134.46s)]
*  endorsers of candidates. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=139.66s)]
*  We were atop that just the other day, and it is ranked choice voting for this coming [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=140.78s)]
*  primary. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  But what do you say, though, to Democrats who look at what we saw in November with Vice [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  President Harris losing? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=150.5s)]
*  And a lot of the postgame analysis, if you will, was the party had moved too far to the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=152.46s)]
*  left, that it was actually time to come back to the center a little bit to connect to a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=156.5s)]
*  lot of those working class blue collar voters who have broken for Trump in recent cycles. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  That seems to be what Governor Cuomo is saying. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=166.26s)]
*  What do you say to people who say, well, I like the guy, but he's not right for this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=168.86s)]
*  moment. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=172.34s)]
*  He's too lefty? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=173.34s)]
*  Well, you know, I think we as politicians need to lecture less and listen more. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=174.34s)]
*  And when we saw New York have the greatest swing towards Trump in the entire nation, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=177.9s)]
*  11 and a half points, we saw that it took place in the hearts of immigrant New York. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=181.38000000000002s)]
*  And so I went there to Fordham Road in the Bronx, Hillside Avenue in Queens. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=185.22000000000003s)]
*  I asked those voters, why did they vote for him? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  And they told me they remembered having more money in their pocket four years ago. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  I asked them what it would take to bring them back to the Democratic Party. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  They said a relentless focus on an economic agenda. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=196.74s)]
*  And when I told them my plan to freeze the rent, make buses fast and free, deliver universal [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=199.66s)]
*  child care, they said that they would vote for me. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=203.58s)]
*  And I think ultimately that's what we need is a recognition that for too long our party [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=205.66s)]
*  has moved away from working class voters. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  It's time we actually bring them back. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=211.78s)]
*  And it's time we do so with an agenda that is not only urgent, but possible. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=213.46s)]
*  It's just a question of political will. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=216.68s)]
*  So let's turn to public safety now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=218.04000000000002s)]
*  Any New York City mayor that's a top priority, we have Giuliani, Bloomberg, de Blasio, the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  like, Mayor Adams ran on that first centrally four years ago. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=225.54s)]
*  What is your relationship? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=231.66s)]
*  What is your plan for policing, including there are some who suggest that you're perhaps [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=233.2s)]
*  not supportive enough of the police department? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=238.38s)]
*  You know, I've been very clear, which is that police have a critical role to play in creating [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=240.5s)]
*  public safety. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=244.18s)]
*  And I speak to those officers on the beat. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=245.18s)]
*  I hear a frustration from them that we're asking them to do more than just focus on [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=246.89999999999998s)]
*  serious crimes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=250.88s)]
*  work of mental health professionals and social workers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=252.88s)]
*  And that reliance on having them deal with almost every failure of the social safety [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=255.6s)]
*  net is making it impossible for them to tackle those crimes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=259.74s)]
*  And so that's why we have put forward a proposal to create a department of community safety [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=263.0s)]
*  that would focus on the mental health crisis, that would focus on gun violence, hate crimes, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=267.4s)]
*  and ensure that we allow police to do their jobs and we hire mental health professionals [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=271.36s)]
*  to do the work that they are best suited to do. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=275.18s)]
*  And we've been talking all morning about this incident yesterday in Boulder, Colorado, where [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=277.06s)]
*  some elderly, mostly Jewish residents were holding a peaceful march just asking for hostages [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=281.44s)]
*  to come home from Gaza. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=287.32s)]
*  They were attacked by a man with a makeshift flamethrower. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=288.32s)]
*  It is just the latest in a rise of anti-Semitic violent incidents across the country in New [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=291.0s)]
*  York City, of course, home to by far the largest Jewish population in the United States. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=297.08s)]
*  What is your message to those voters, to Jewish residents of New York City who feel for their [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=301.04s)]
*  safety? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=305.6s)]
*  Why should they trust you at the helm? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=306.6s)]
*  You know, I hear them and I hear that fear when I speak to Jewish New Yorkers across [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=308.04s)]
*  this city. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=311.8s)]
*  And ultimately, Jewish New Yorkers deserve to be protected. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=312.8s)]
*  They deserve to be safe. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=315.48s)]
*  And as the next mayor of this city, that's what I will do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=316.76s)]
*  And I've heard, especially when we speak about anti-Semitism, how do we go beyond just talking [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=319.16s)]
*  about it? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=323.26s)]
*  How do we actually tackle it? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=324.26s)]
*  And that's why at the heart of that proposal to create a department of community safety [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=325.26s)]
*  is a commitment to increase funding for anti-hate crime programming by 800 percent, the very [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=328.68s)]
*  programming we've seen be effective at countering the rise in these kinds of attacks. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=334.14s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=337.78s)]
*  Certainly a fascinating race. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=338.78s)]
*  The primary is just a few weeks away. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=340.02s)]
*  Candidate for New York City Mayor, Eselvin Zoran Maldani. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=341.74s)]
*  Eselvin, thank you for being here today. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=344.5s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOz7puCCHg&t=346.38s)]
