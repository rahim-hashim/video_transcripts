# 'Underwater': Why Trump's approval on immigration is 'tanking'
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc)
*  Our headlines around President Trump's deportation push are clearly breaking through. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=0.0s)]
*  Take the case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=5.76s)]
*  According to one recent poll, 61 percent have heard a lot about his situation, the same [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  number who have heard about changes to the stock market. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=14.24s)]
*  Joining us now, president of the progressive public opinion research firm, Impact Research. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=17.96s)]
*  Molly Murphy, good to have you on with us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=24.96s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  We'll start right there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  What are you finding that people are feeling about these deportations, which by the way [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  was something that Donald Trump campaigned on? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=33.94s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=37.36s)]
*  So it's really been interesting just in the last few weeks, Donald Trump's approval rating [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=38.36s)]
*  on immigration has slipped to underwater. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=42.44s)]
*  And that has been a source of strength for him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=45.3s)]
*  It was one of his strongest issues in the 2024 presidential campaign. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Coming into office, people had a lot of confidence with him on this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=51.16s)]
*  But as this case continues to go on, as he has defied the court orders, as he continues [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=54.76s)]
*  to make this not a conversation about immigration, but about due process and about defying the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=59.48s)]
*  courts, his immigration approval rating has come down. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=65.0s)]
*  At the same time, people aren't really against deporting people who are here illegally. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=68.08s)]
*  And so this isn't as though they just tend to oppose what Donald Trump says about, hey, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=72.56s)]
*  we got to make sure illegal immigrants are gone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  They tend to still support that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=80.08s)]
*  But the way he is going about it and the how is really tanking his overall approval [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=81.96s)]
*  on the issue itself. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  So and on Obreo Garcia, again, there are a lot of polls that show the Trump administration [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  upside down, like 15, 20 points on that issue. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=94.8s)]
*  So yeah, let's talk about generally, as you said, a lot of Americans have supported Donald [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=98.78s)]
*  Trump's attempts to deport illegal immigrants. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=106.44s)]
*  People here illegally, but it's the specifics and going into something a little deeper [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=110.18s)]
*  that again, we've been talking about a Wall Street Journal op-ed about due process. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=114.9s)]
*  And I think a lot of people in Washington, D.C., that may have been a little more cynical [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  about Americans' knowledge of due process are surprised. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  It's showing up in all the polls. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=128.26000000000002s)]
*  Americans are going, we don't care who it's for. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=129.9s)]
*  We expect due process if you're in America. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=132.44s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=135.46s)]
*  I mean, I've got numbers for you right here, Joe. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=136.46s)]
*  77% think that the federal government should be allowed to deport undocumented immigrants [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=139.7s)]
*  if it has provided evidence and a hearing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=143.66s)]
*  And the numbers go up when you're asking, should people be able to appeal a decision [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=146.34s)]
*  in the court? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=151.02s)]
*  75% of Americans believe that including immigrants, not just American citizens, should be able [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=152.02s)]
*  to go before a hearing, but go before a judge and have their case adjudicated with evidence. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=158.02s)]
*  And so when the vast majority of Americans are saying this and they're watching the president [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=162.98s)]
*  say, I don't know if people should have due process, that really concerns them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=167.94s)]
*  I mean, do people understand the legal underpinnings and what is written in the Constitution? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=171.74s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  But they do understand that a core American value is that everyone deserves a hearing, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  everyone deserves a trial, and to be able to appeal that decision. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=181.78s)]
*  I want to ask you about some of those economic numbers that we saw up there, particularly [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=184.54s)]
*  on tariffs, where he's deeply underwater. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=188.14s)]
*  One of the appeals that people who are on his side and rooting for him and hoping that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=191.1s)]
*  he'll change his mind tariffs has made to him is, okay, if you don't understand it's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=195.74s)]
*  bad for the economy, how about it's bad for you? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=199.5s)]
*  Because they understand the way he thinks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  And that has not prevailed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=203.94s)]
*  But clearly, if you look at these numbers, they are bad for him. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=205.3s)]
*  They're awful. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=208.58s)]
*  I mean, there is not a singular issue that is a bigger weight around Donald Trump's next [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=209.58s)]
*  right now than the tariffs. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=213.62s)]
*  There was a navigator poll out this morning and it had a big word cloud and it just said, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  what is giving you negative impressions of Donald Trump? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  And it was all tariffs. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  And that is independent voters. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=223.82000000000002s)]
*  That's up to about a quarter of Republicans who are not liking the tariffs. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=225.62s)]
*  75% think costs are going to go up. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=229.62s)]
*  They think it is going to impact their family's budget, which is already a source of stress. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  People are at the max when it comes to costs right now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=236.34s)]
*  And generally, people don't disentangle their own circumstances from the larger economy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  Right now, especially with inflation over the last few years, what they will say is, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=244.34s)]
*  if it's bad for me, it's bad for the economy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=248.02s)]
*  And so even if there wasn't the tumult in the stock market, just the promise that their [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=250.02s)]
*  food is going to get more expensive, home repairs, all of those things is bad for their [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=254.66s)]
*  situation and they can't bear much more. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=258.82s)]
*  And it can't be said enough that Donald Trump's signature campaign promise was, I'm going [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  to lower prices. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=264.06s)]
*  We haven't seen that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=265.06s)]
*  And now there's real fears prices are going to rise. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=266.06s)]
*  And so connected, I mean, we know how important these economic issues are, but connected to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=267.9s)]
*  this idea that Donald Trump, unlikely messenger as he may be, was elected because he's going [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=271.7s)]
*  to fight for you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=275.58s)]
*  That's always been his sort of like, I'm for you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=276.58s)]
*  I'm going to stand up and fight. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=278.78000000000003s)]
*  Are voters starting to doubt that? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=280.7s)]
*  They are starting to doubt that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=281.9s)]
*  In fact, every poll I have seen over the last two weeks now approaching 60 percent of Americans [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=283.5s)]
*  say he does not care about people like me. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=289.26s)]
*  He does not share my values. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  There was an alarming number, 57 percent in a poll that was out today said that they think [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=293.5s)]
*  that he prioritizes other people who are not like me. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=297.65999999999997s)]
*  And so they just don't think he's thinking about them. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=301.26s)]
*  And so when his approval rating comes down on the economy, there's so much more depth [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  to it in terms of what it means to people. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  They thought that he got up every day fighting for them and every day he says you're going [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=309.9s)]
*  to have to pay more for dolls or maybe it's going to be a recession. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=313.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  They don't feel like that's just an economic problem. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  That's a problem of who's in the White House and who's fighting for them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  Can you talk about how quickly things change for all presidents? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=323.26s)]
*  You promised something on the campaign trail. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=326.02s)]
*  Donald Trump talks about tariffs. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  He loves tariffs. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=329.85999999999996s)]
*  Tariffs are beautiful. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=331.17999999999995s)]
*  He gets into office. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=332.38s)]
*  They don't like how it's implemented. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=333.38s)]
*  And suddenly it's actually one of his greatest strengths becomes one of its greatest weaknesses. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=334.9s)]
*  I always think back to Joe Biden. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden was over 50 percent, as you know, until Afghanistan. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=343.17999999999995s)]
*  Now if you look at the polls throughout the campaign, if you look at the polls probably [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=347.02s)]
*  for a decade before the campaign, if you looked at the polls up until the withdrawal from [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=350.32s)]
*  Afghanistan, 60, 65 percent of Americans said, man, they're 20 years. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  Come on, bring them home. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=360.73999999999995s)]
*  But it was how that was implemented that actually put Joe Biden under underwater in the polls [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=363.78s)]
*  and he never came back. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=372.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=373.5s)]
*  On the tariffs, there was some apprehension even in the campaign about the tariffs. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=375.53999999999996s)]
*  But because Donald Trump was so credible on the economy, they tended to think, OK, I don't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=379.02s)]
*  like the sound of tariffs. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=383.46s)]
*  I do think that my costs could go up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=384.73999999999995s)]
*  But I trust this guy because I think he cares about me and he says he's got a plan that's [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=386.78s)]
*  going to bring down costs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=391.02s)]
*  So I think I'm going to get behind this idea, give him the shot at this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  And now not only are his numbers a problem in terms of people opposing the tariffs, they [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=396.62s)]
*  think costs are going to go up. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=400.90000000000003s)]

*  problems much like we saw with President Biden. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=406.5s)]
*  It then not being able to execute that withdrawal created confidence issues on a host of other [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=409.3s)]
*  problems. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=414.18s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing on his execution on the tariffs. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=415.18s)]
*  And I will say one huge alarm that the Trump administration should just have on top of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=417.42s)]
*  everything is Ukraine. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSVSve3K0Nc&t=423.5s)]
