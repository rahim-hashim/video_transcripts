# Richard Engel: Most Israelis seem to be behind this conflict with Iran
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0)
*  Let's go straight to Israel. Joining us now from Israel, just south of Tel Aviv, is NBC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=0.0s)]
*  News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel. Richard, what are you seeing there? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Well, let me just start by describing the site where I am right now. I am just south [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=10.52s)]
*  of Tel Aviv, as you mentioned. This is where one of the Iranian ballistic missiles landed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=16.52s)]
*  a couple of days ago. But there is still an active search and rescue operation here. At [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=21.44s)]
*  least six people were killed in the initial strike and rescue workers have recovered another [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  two bodies, bringing the death toll so far to eight in just this attack. Let me just [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  step out of camera for a second. You can get a sense of the extent of the damage. This [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=37.56s)]
*  bomb landing right in the middle, this missile I should say, right in the middle of a residential [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=41.8s)]
*  area, shearing off the side of the apartment building, obliterating all of the buildings [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=47.08s)]
*  around it. Actually, when you look at it, it's quite surprising that the death toll [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=52.82s)]
*  was relatively low considering this city is still full. There are no evacuation orders [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=56.82s)]
*  in place. There is a semi state of emergency where people are told to stay near shelters. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=62.82s)]
*  They're told not to congregate. But people are not evacuating this city despite what [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=68.22s)]
*  was a threat by Iran for Israelis to, for their own safety, get out of this country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=73.78s)]
*  But I must say that over the last 24 hours or so, there have been more Iranian barrages, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  but they are not the same that we saw in the first days. There are still barrages, but [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=86.34s)]
*  not hundreds of ballistic missiles at a time, not hundreds per day even. Instead, last night [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=93.14s)]
*  there were two batches fired more or less back to back, about 15 minutes apart, and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=99.6s)]
*  each one only had about a dozen missiles in it and nearly all of them were shot down. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=104.9s)]
*  The Israeli military is systematically taking out Iran's military capabilities, its nuclear [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=109.86s)]
*  program, its fighter jets, its launch sites. And now there is this open question, will [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=116.86s)]
*  the United States get involved? And President Trump issued that ultimatum calling for an [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=125.85999999999999s)]
*  unconditional surrender. Iran's supreme leader has said that unconditional surrender is effectively [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=130.74s)]
*  out of the question. He's issued some bellicose statements on X saying that the war is only [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=137.26s)]
*  beginning and that Iran will show, quote, no mercy. But the real question is do they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  have the capacity to do much more than they are already doing? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=149.54s)]
*  So Richard, if you could describe the domestic debate right now, or the opposition, the support [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=155.12s)]
*  for this all out war against Iran inside of Israel, but also about any discussions, debate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=162.28s)]
*  about the United States becoming involved. Where do the Israeli people seem to be on [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=170.0s)]
*  this? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=175.0s)]
*  I would say at this stage most Israelis seem to be behind this conflict. Once Iran started [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=178.68s)]
*  launching ballistic missiles, creating seeds of devastation like this in the heart of Tel [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=184.28s)]
*  Aviv and in the surrounding suburbs like I am right now, a lot of Israelis pulled together. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=190.76s)]
*  We're not seeing the same kind of anti-Natenya who protests on the streets that we did even [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=195.92s)]
*  a few weeks, even a few months ago. Instead, Israelis seem to say that this is a war that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  they had no choice but to launch, that it is better to fight against Iran now while [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  it is weak than wait for it to have a nuclear weapon. So yes, of course Israel society is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=216.24s)]
*  divided, it is divided socially, it is divided politically, but there are no protests and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=223.24s)]
*  when we're talking to people on the streets, most of them seem behind the operation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=228.24s)]
*  All right, NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel, as always, thank you so much. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=232.52s)]
*  Ed Luce, you look at reaction around the world and especially in Europe. We did have German [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  Chancellor Mertz come out saying that Israel is doing the dirty work, the hard work for [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=246.08s)]
*  the rest of us. Other European leaders seemed a bit more reserved in their support for the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=251.28s)]
*  United States getting involved or Israel's actions in Iran. Give us a reaction that you're [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=256.6s)]
*  picking up across Europe and the world. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=264.12s)]
*  I think they're all calling for restraint, the British, the French. They, of course, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=267.44s)]
*  have just been in at the G7 meeting in Alaska that Donald Trump left early. But they're [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=273.44s)]
*  fairly peripheral to this situation. I think far more interesting is Russia's relative [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=281.12s)]
*  restraint on this. They like the fact that the focus has shifted from Ukraine to the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=288.92s)]
*  Middle East, even though Iran is really a protégé of Russia's. Putin hasn't been robust in support [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=293.72s)]
*  of Iran. He hasn't been providing it with the weapons it's been asking for since it's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=301.04s)]
*  been really exposed over the last few months and is indicating that he's not going to get [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  in the way of whatever Trump is up to in the Middle East. This is a different kind of relationship, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=312.92s)]
*  of course, to the one that he had with Biden. But ultimately, I think there's real skepticism [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=318.6s)]
*  about Netanyahu's grounds for launching this war on Iran right now. The Europeans, the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=324.44s)]
*  British, I know, have similar intelligence to what the American intelligence agencies [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=332.76s)]
*  have been saying, which is that Iran is not moved dramatically closer to break out a nuclear [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=337.0s)]
*  situation than it was a few months ago. There is this view, and I think it's pretty well [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=344.36s)]
*  grounded, that Netanyahu stays in power because of war and that he's run out of road with [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=350.08s)]
*  Gaza. There's been a real growing backlash internationally, but also at home, former [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=357.08s)]
*  prime ministers like Ehud Olmert criticizing his conduct of war in Gaza. And that there [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=362.84s)]
*  was some nervousness by Netanyahu that Trump's talks with Iran, that Steve Wittkopf's negotiations [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=369.68s)]
*  there in the region with Iran might be coming close to some kind of a deal, a deal, of course, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=377.0s)]
*  that Trump pulled out of in his first term. And that, of course, would have shut off [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=384.08s)]
*  Netanyahu's ability to conduct an operation like this. So I think the view is that this [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=391.12s)]
*  is a war of choice and a war that is essentially sabotaging any negotiations that Trump is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  planning to continue with Iran. A lot of skepticism about the grounds for this war. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkK3UwHQ1f0&t=406.68s)]
