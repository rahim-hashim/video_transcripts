# Steve Rattner: Trump is 'desperate' to show progress on tariffs
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M)
*  Businesses are frozen right now, ratcheting back their spending. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=0.0s)]
*  And so it's their planning as if these things are still in place. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=5.28s)]
*  One other thing you should point out is that we have a weak negotiating hand here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=9.32s)]
*  I know the president keeps saying we're... [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=13.4s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=15.32s)]
*  We're almost in a recession. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=17.44s)]
*  We have markets that are on edge. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=18.96s)]
*  We need people to buy our debt. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=20.48s)]
*  And China supplies us with a lot of cheap goods. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=22.36s)]
*  We can see inflation ratchet up dramatically if we don't need to deal with them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=25.64s)]
*  And Xi knows this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=29.8s)]
*  That is Fox Business correspondent Charlie Gasparino with an assessment of the economic [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=31.6s)]
*  impact of President Trump's tariffs. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  Wall Street saw a third straight day of gains though yesterday amid President Trump's toned-down [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=38.08s)]
*  rhetoric on tariffs. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=43.04s)]
*  But when it comes to the trade war with China, Washington, and Beijing, sending mixed messages [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=44.64s)]
*  on whether talks actually even are taking place. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=48.6s)]
*  Several Chinese officials have said there are absolutely no negotiations happening. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=51.72s)]
*  While President Trump suggested yesterday some talks had taken place earlier in the day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=56.6s)]
*  Well, they had a meeting this morning, so I can't tell you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=62.76s)]
*  It doesn't matter who they is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=65.92s)]
*  We may reveal it later. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=68.28s)]
*  But they had meetings this morning, and we've been meeting with China. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=69.64s)]
*  The general they. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=74.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, we've learned U.S. officials did hold trade talks with South Korea yesterday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=75.8s)]
*  South Korea represents Asia's fourth largest economy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=80.4s)]
*  Leaders there reportedly hoping to work out a deal by July to avoid tariffs. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=83.64s)]
*  Let's bring in former Treasury official, Morning Joe Economic Analyst Steve Ratner. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=88.32s)]
*  Steve, good morning. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=92.32s)]
*  So are they talking? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=93.32s)]
*  Are they not talking? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=94.64s)]
*  U.S. and China. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=95.64s)]
*  China says no. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=97.64s)]
*  There's no serious negotiation going on. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=98.64s)]
*  Trump floated a vague meeting that he says took place yesterday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=100.56s)]
*  But are they talking at all from what you can tell? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=103.52s)]
*  What you have going on here is that Trump now is desperate to show some progress on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=106.32s)]
*  these tariffs because every time it looks like nothing good is happening, the stock [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=110.08s)]
*  market plunges and then he throws out these feelers or makes some other announcement about [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=114.28s)]
*  a delay and the stock market goes up. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=119.12s)]
*  And we do know he does care about the stock market. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=121.44s)]
*  So I think they're desperately trying to show some kind of progress. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  They talk about India and this and that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=126.56s)]
*  I think China is the really tough nut. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=128.52s)]
*  We have these huge, huge reciprocal tariffs on on both sides now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=131.68s)]
*  I think my personal view, which based on I'm not obviously in the White House, is that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=135.68s)]
*  I think Trump did not expect this kind of reaction from China when he put them on. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  I think he thought they would quickly come to the table because we buy so much stuff [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=145.2s)]
*  from them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=149.16s)]
*  But instead, Xi basically said, I'm a real country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=150.16s)]
*  My economy is essentially as big as yours, a lot more people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=152.8s)]
*  I make all kinds of stuff that you need and I'm not going to be pushed around by you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=157.64s)]
*  So he put on his tariffs, Trump put on more tariffs and here we sit with 154 percent tariffs [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=161.96s)]
*  on imports from them, which basically means no imports. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=167.0s)]
*  So the answer is, look, at some point I think there will be conversations with China. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=169.68s)]
*  I just don't believe at this point we're really making any progress. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=174.12s)]
*  What's your sense, Steve? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=176.96s)]
*  Obviously you're not in this White House, as you said, but you know people, you're connected [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=177.96s)]
*  to people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  What I've heard from people on Wall Street is they're comforted to some extent that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  is there at least providing some reality checks about what tariffs do and what is going to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=188.28s)]
*  happen to the economy despite his public support of President Trump. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=193.36s)]
*  What's your sense though of the conversations going on behind the scenes about the value [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=197.2s)]
*  or the damage being done by these tariffs? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=202.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think Scott Besson understands it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=205.28s)]
*  I think Keith Hennessey, who runs the National Economic Council, understands it and is on [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=207.76s)]
*  the right side of the issue. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=212.16s)]
*  But this, as we've talked about before, is the one issue that Trump believes that he [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=213.86s)]
*  and he alone, he's one of his famous phrases, really understands how valuable tariffs are. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=217.86s)]
*  And he's got Peter Navarro, who Elon Musk more or less correctly described his number [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  as a sack of bricks, kind of egging him on. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=229.34s)]
*  And so people are critical of Besson for not having made more progress styling this back. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  But you've got a guy who's got the bit between his teeth and he's just running for it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  Steve, why don't we bring on the conversation we were having privately, which is about what [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=241.34s)]
*  the effect is on American business. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=245.5s)]
*  And what will it take for the people you talk with every day, CEOs and so forth, to essentially [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=247.5s)]
*  start making investments again? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=253.44s)]
*  To basically say, OK, I can sell this or buy this because I now have confidence that the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  price that it's at now is reflective of its real value and in the same zip code as where [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=259.38s)]
*  it'll be in six months. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=264.8s)]
*  What has to happen and what's your sense of the timing? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=266.5s)]
*  What's the most optimistic we could be on that? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=269.42s)]
*  Well, as it happens, I was just two days at a conference in Washington with a lot of CEOs. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=271.42s)]
*  And what is striking is the unanimity of view among CEOs about how bad this policy is. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=276.78s)]
*  You cannot find, I haven't yet to find a single CEO who says, hey, this is great. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=283.09999999999997s)]
*  It's going to solve this problem or that problem. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=287.5s)]
*  So they are deeply, deeply unhappy about the situation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=289.58s)]
*  And it has affected all kinds of business. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=293.26s)]
*  Deals have more or less come to a halt, as you know, now that you're in the investment [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  banking world. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  And why wouldn't they? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=301.86s)]
*  Who would buy or sell something when you have no idea what it might be worth six months [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=302.86s)]
*  from now when the whole tariff thing hopefully does get resolved? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=307.3s)]
*  But all kinds of other decisions, investment decisions, do I build a plant, do I not build [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=311.48s)]
*  a plant, where do I build it? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  Everything is kind of on hold in this economy at the moment. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=317.3s)]
*  And you have a very unhappy business community. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  And you also are going to start to see shortages of things. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=323.86s)]
*  This is going to be, I'm going to exaggerate slightly, like the Soviet Union in the 1960s [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=327.42s)]
*  or something. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  Empty shells. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  Empty shells. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=334.78000000000003s)]
*  You're going to see empty shells where you can't, you know, 90% of our toys are imported [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  and virtually all those come from China. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=339.54s)]
*  This goes on until Christmas. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=341.62s)]
*  Not so many toys at Christmas for the kids. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=343.18s)]
*  Dr. O'Meary. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=344.94s)]
*  You know, Susan Page, I think one of the hopes of people who oppose these policies and see [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=345.94s)]
*  the damage they're doing to the economy is that at least President Trump would view the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=350.42s)]
*  damage it's doing to him. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=353.98s)]
*  And that might prompt him to reverse the policies you're writing this morning about economic [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=356.62s)]
*  polling we've seen over the last couple of days that show his approval rating down generally, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=360.90000000000003s)]
*  but really specifically down on the economy, down at 37% in one poll and 40% or so in another. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=365.88s)]
*  Is there any sense that perhaps these numbers might give him some pause about the policies [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=374.2s)]
*  that he's endorsed and sticking by to this point? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=380.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  I think only two issues matter front and center for President Trump. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=384.68s)]
*  One is immigration. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=388.38s)]
*  The other is the economy. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=389.38s)]
*  And of course, the feeling Americans had of trust in him to handle the economy in a smart [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=391.28s)]
*  way was one of the fundamental reasons he was elected president both times. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=397.18s)]
*  Both times he won elections. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  And yet that has been really undermined by the chaos that we've seen, by the turmoil [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=403.04s)]
*  in the stock market, by the concern that we heard in the clip that began this segment [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=408.0s)]
*  that we are at this moment almost in a recession or nearly in a recession. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  So this was a, in the in the pupil that just came out, this was a 19-point advantage. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6aQgEMuz-M&t=416.56s)]
