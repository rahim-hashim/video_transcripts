Video Description: Authorities have confirmed at least 120 deaths across six counties, including those of 59 adults and 36 children in Kerr County. Also, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday responded to questions of if he would call for an investigation into possible failures surrounding the deadly floods said it was the 'word choice of losers'. Also, Camp Mystic cabins stood in an ‘extremely hazardous’ floodway, according to a NYT report.

# 'Deep impact phase' of searching: More than 170 missing after Texas flood
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk)
*  Research continues this morning in Texas as officials say more than 170 people now are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=0.0s)]
*  still missing in last week's deadly flooding. Teams fanning out by air, water, land, even on [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=5.84s)]
*  a horseback in the aftermath of a disaster that has killed at least 120 people across six counties. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=10.88s)]
*  Five campers and one counselor remain missing from Camp Mystic where more heartbreaking stories of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=17.84s)]
*  loss are coming to light with each passing day. Like eight-year-old camper Mary Kate Jacoby, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=23.759999999999998s)]
*  her family says, quote, she entered the gates of heaven, adding she was tiny but mighty and full [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=29.92s)]
*  of love. Today questions continue about whether more could have been done to warn residents ahead [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=36.16s)]
*  of the catastrophic floods. At a press conference yesterday, local officials defended their response [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=41.36s)]
*  and said those questions will be answered in time. I believe those questions need to be answered [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=46.72s)]
*  to the family of the missed loved ones, to the public. We're not running, we're not going to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=53.6s)]
*  hide from anything. That's going to be checked into at a later time. I wish I could tell you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=57.04s)]
*  that time. Folks, I don't know how many lives our KPD team saved in an hour in Kerrville, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=60.96s)]
*  but I know that this tragedy, as horrific as it is, could have been so much worse. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=68.72s)]
*  That response comes as new reporting from NBC News reveals the former Kerr County Commissioner [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=75.44s)]
*  described the county's flood warning system as antiquated back in 2016 and that Kerr County [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=80.56s)]
*  officials discussed warning systems more than two dozen times since then. Joining us now from Kerrville, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=86.08s)]
*  Texas, is NBC News national correspondent Aaron Gilchrist. Aaron, good morning. What's the latest there? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=91.84s)]
*  Hey, Willie. Good morning. The search effort really is going to continue today in the way [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  that it has over the last week. It was an effort that started in the immediate hours after the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  flooding last Friday morning. And since then, we understand that there have been about 2,100 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=108.48s)]
*  first responders on the ground across this region, primarily here in Kerr County, but in other [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=114.4s)]
*  counties that have been impacted by the flooding here as well. That includes teams from obviously [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  across the state of Texas that have been operating in the air, in the water, and so many of them on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=126.4s)]
*  foot, along with volunteers, along with search and rescue teams that have been brought in from [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=131.44s)]
*  other states. We know cadaver dogs are being brought into the area from other states as well [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=135.28s)]
*  to help in this search effort. And we heard officials say yesterday that they're now in [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=139.6s)]
*  sort of a deep impact phase of the search effort here, where so much of the water has receded and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=145.12s)]
*  these teams are able to get underneath a lot of the debris that had been pushed down river through [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=152.16s)]
*  the course of the flooding. And that's going to allow them to be able to find, they hope, more [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=158.96s)]
*  of the missing people. At this point, as you noted, there's a death toll of about 120, and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=163.6s)]
*  there's still more than 170 people who are missing, the known missing, as has been described to us. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=168.48s)]
*  And the majority of those people are here in Kerr County as well. You talk about the accountability [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=176.0s)]
*  piece of this. We know that the sheriff has been pressed over the last couple of days about when [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=182.16s)]
*  emergency officials were aware of the level of flooding that was expected to come down the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=188.08s)]
*  Guadalupe River and when they started alerting the citizens, when they started trying to get [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=194.4s)]
*  people away from the Guadalupe River. And he wasn't really able to give a detailed response [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=200.08s)]
*  to that question. It's something that he's been pressed on. And yesterday in the briefing they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=205.36s)]
*  held, he said that the incident will be reviewed, saying that there would be an after-action report [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  produced. But at a later time, he said the focus really of his entire law enforcement enterprise [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=217.04s)]
*  here is the focus is really on trying to execute the recovery here, trying to find as many of the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=223.28s)]
*  missing people as possible and to try to get this community back up on its feet. So many people who [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=228.72s)]
*  did survive the flooding have had their lives really just devastated by what happened here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=235.2s)]
*  At the same time, you noted there is a special session of the state legislature later on this [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=239.28s)]
*  month that was already on the books. And now this flooding incident is going to be at the top of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=244.32s)]
*  agenda. Governor Greg Abbott released his agenda for that special session late yesterday. And the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  flooding incident in terms of both looking at legislation for better improvements to the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  alert systems here and the infrastructure around flooding, as well as relief funding for this [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=263.36s)]
*  region, those are all going to be a part of that special session, guys. Aaron, we're hearing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=267.68s)]
*  harrowing stories coming out of Camp Mystic. Sadly, funerals now being planned for little [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=270.8s)]
*  girls in Dallas, Houston, and other parts across Texas. As I mentioned, five campers and a counselor [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  still unaccounted for from Camp Mystic. New reporting this morning that even during expansion [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=281.68s)]
*  of the camp a few years back, it remained in an extremely hazardous flood zone that probably [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=286.64s)]
*  needed more warnings than it got and a more sophisticated warning system. What else are we [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=291.92s)]
*  hearing out of Camp Mystic about the girls who died, the counselor who died, and the director [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=296.88s)]
*  of the camp who passed away as well? Willie, I got to tell you, I was able to drive up the river [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=302.56s)]
*  to Camp Mystic yesterday along with our team. And it was an incredible sight to see what happened [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=308.48s)]
*  in that community of Hunt, Texas. We were told that when the floodwaters rose, Hunt essentially [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=317.04s)]
*  became an island or a series of islands even. And people, by the accounting of two police officers [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=324.48s)]
*  who happened to be, who happened to live in that area, they were not able to get out. People were [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  not, they were not able to get in into people. They saw some folks, they were able to yell to them [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=336.56s)]
*  to try to get to the rooftops and to get to safe areas. As they were able to access people, they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=341.36s)]
*  were trying to triage those who had been injured. And when you look at Camp Mystic, you can see some [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  of the pictures that we saw here yesterday. I mean, the river is right there, just a few yards [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=352.56s)]
*  away from one of the living quarters, the cabins there. And you have to imagine how incredibly [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=358.8s)]
*  frightening this was for the young ladies who were at this camp as they saw that river raging, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=365.6s)]
*  ripping trees out of the ground, pushing homes off foundations nearby. It was just an incredible [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=373.04s)]
*  sight to see there. We know that 165 young ladies were rescued. The campers and staff there were [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=379.36s)]
*  rescued. 27 were initially listed as missing. That number is now down to six. We also know that there [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=386.0s)]
*  was a disaster plan that the camp was required to put together. That's a requirement by the state. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  That plan had been submitted to the state and approved just two days before this flooding [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=398.56s)]
*  incident. That plan did include an evacuation plan, an understanding of who at the camp was [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=404.96s)]
*  supposed to execute what responsibilities during a major incident. There are still questions, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  obviously, about to what degree they were able to operationalize that particular plan, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=415.12s)]
*  with it only having been approved two days in advance. But there would have been previous plans, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  we assume, that we still need to ask questions about whether the staff there were trained on [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  what to do. But it is worth noting, Willie, that, again, 165 lives were saved by helicopters coming [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=430.08s)]
*  in and helping to get people out of Camp Mystic. NBC's Aaron Gilchrist reporting from Kerrville, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=436.47999999999996s)]
*  Texas. Aaron, thank you for your reporting. We appreciate it. Joe? You know, Willie, the flood [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=441.68s)]
*  system, as you reported, was considered antiquated a decade ago. You had not only the people of Kerr, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=449.12s)]
*  Kerrville, you had to have people in the county and people in the state repeatedly ignore these [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=460.08s)]
*  very clear signals that people's lives were in danger, Texans' lives were in danger because [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=470.56s)]
*  they weren't upgrading an antiquated system. We heard a sheriff say in a clip that things could [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=478.24s)]
*  have been so much worse, and certainly they could have, and we salute the first responders. But [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  also there is no doubt if the warnings over the past decade had been listened to by politicians [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=493.12s)]
*  in Texas on the local and the state level, then this tragedy could have been so less worse, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  so less tragic. And I'm just reminded of Hurricane Katrina, how for a decade you had [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=508.4s)]
*  city officials in New Orleans, you had state officials in Louisiana ignore warning after [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=518.8s)]
*  warning after warning about an old antiquated levee system that was not able to hold back [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=524.8s)]
*  the floodwaters. So it seems to me, Willie, that's the same thing that's happening here. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=533.28s)]
*  They knew there was a problem, and there's really no passing of the buck, because I'll tell you how [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=540.56s)]
*  things happen. When I represented six counties in northwest Florida, if there was a problem that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=546.64s)]
*  people had in a hurricane coming, then somebody saw a problem, somebody would talk to a county [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=552.56s)]
*  commissioner. A county commissioner would talk to me. I would get funding for whatever needed to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=560.4s)]
*  be taken care of, and it would be taken care of. I find it hard to believe two things right here. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=567.04s)]
*  One, again, complaints about an antiquated warning system went unheeded for a decade. That's number [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=572.8s)]
*  one. Number two, that the local authorities, that the county authorities, that the state authorities [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=579.84s)]
*  allowed a children's camp to be built in a flood zone just a few years ago, in a highly dangerous [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=588.96s)]
*  flood zone. You, of course, talking about the reporting that's on the front page of the New [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=599.36s)]
*  York Times today, Willie. So that's, again, one more thing where the state of Texas fell miserably. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=603.52s)]
*  I find it hard to believe that would happen in the state of Florida. You know, post-Andrew, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=611.36s)]
*  we took, leaders took every precaution to make sure that building standards were raised. But again, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=616.8s)]
*  how they knew this was a problem for a decade and still allowed Camp Mystic to expand in an [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=625.12s)]
*  active flood zone is beyond me. Yeah, to expand or at least not have a new updated warning system as [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=632.96s)]
*  they expanded as part of getting the permit or part of that expansion. There are camps nearby [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=642.08s)]
*  in the same flood zone, Joe, and New York Times has some great reporting on this this morning where [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=648.48s)]
*  just by word of mouth, there was a nearby camp where a staffer was up at one o'clock in the morning [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=653.36s)]
*  and heard the alert on his phone. And he started waking people up and telling them, move them to [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  higher ground, and everyone in that camp survived. The point is, though, you shouldn't be relying on [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=663.9200000000001s)]
*  somebody happening to be awake at one o'clock in the morning and seeing something on his phone to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=668.88s)]
*  run around to cabins and get everybody to higher ground. That's what happened and so tragically and [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=672.96s)]
*  so devastatingly did not happen at Camp Mystic. There's got to be a better way. Joe, oddly, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=678.4s)]
*  the other day, Governor Abbott of Texas, very defensive and bristling at reporters saying, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=685.76s)]
*  this is the talk of losers to ask these kind of questions in a moment like this while we're [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=690.56s)]
*  still looking for children. Now it's the talk of accountability and making sure this never happens [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=695.12s)]
*  again and asking questions about how this was possible, how we got here, and preventing again [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=700.8s)]
*  this from ever, ever happening again to a group of little girls fighting for their lives in the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=707.12s)]
*  middle of the night during a flood. Yeah, I mean, the talk of losers is somebody that... [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=712.16s)]
*  That was an outstandingly disturbing comment. The talk of losers is somebody who doesn't take responsibility, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIING4Gfypk&t=718.16s)]
