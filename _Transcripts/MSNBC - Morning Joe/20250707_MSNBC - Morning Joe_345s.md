# Death toll rises in historic Texas flooding
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk)
*  Meanwhile, as the search for survivors intensifies this morning, authorities are facing growing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=0.0s)]
*  questions about whether enough warnings reached those most at risk. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=5.62s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News correspondent Ryan Chandler live from Kerrville, Texas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=11.8s)]
*  Ryan, what are you learning? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=16.04s)]
*  Well, at this stage in the search for so many families, the anguish for these people is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=18.44s)]
*  turning to anger, calls for accountability. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=25.740000000000002s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=28.6s)]
*  Why was it so bad? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=29.96s)]
*  Could people have been saved? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=31.64s)]
*  It is clear that forecasts seem to not have predicted the danger coming downriver. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=33.88s)]
*  This morning, as the deadly floodwaters in parts of central Texas recede, growing questions [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=41.64s)]
*  about how the catastrophic rainfall seemingly caught this town by surprise. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=47.84s)]
*  Nobody saw this coming. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=53.0s)]
*  Before dawn on Friday, authorities say the Guadalupe River in Kerr County rose 26 feet [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=55.440000000000005s)]
*  in just 45 minutes. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=60.92s)]
*  We know that everybody wants more warning time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=62.72s)]
*  Some local officials say the National Weather Service underestimated the extreme rain. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=66.08s)]
*  It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=71.08s)]
*  The agency says an initial flood watch was issued Thursday afternoon. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=73.4s)]
*  By 1.14 Friday morning, a flash flood warning was in effect in Kerr County. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=77.76s)]
*  Hours later, around four. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=82.4s)]
*  That warning was upgraded to a flash flood emergency in parts of the county, alerting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=84.48s)]
*  residents of imminent danger. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=88.68s)]
*  Scrutiny also turning to the area's warning systems. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  The county's top elected official telling the AP it considered a flood warning like [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=93.92s)]
*  a tornado siren a few years ago, but, quote, the public reeled at the cost. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=98.36s)]
*  The flash flood emergency, just the latest unexpected weather disaster in recent years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=104.2s)]
*  In 2024, after making landfall in Florida, Hurricane Helene ravaged the southeast, killing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  more than 200. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=115.92s)]
*  We were not prepared for this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  The storm dumping rain on mountain towns like Asheville, North Carolina, resulting [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  in a once in a thousand year flooding event. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=123.28s)]
*  Weeks later, Hurricane Milton wreaked havoc across Florida. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=125.84s)]
*  The storm intensifying at one of the fastest rates in history, leaving entire communities [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=130.52s)]
*  underwater. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=136.08s)]
*  Back in Texas, hope fades into heartbreak with so many lives swept away in the sudden [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=138.08s)]
*  storm waters. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=145.08s)]
*  So as the White House defends the National Weather Service, President Trump has activated [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  federal resources. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=152.96s)]
*  Of course, we know Secretary Noem was here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=153.96s)]
*  He has activated FEMA, which we should note is an agency that the president says he wants [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=156.84s)]
*  to eliminate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, at the state level, I was talking with a state legislator yesterday who said [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  while they are out of session right now, he thinks there may be a role for state lawmakers [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=169.28s)]
*  to have some oversight here, to look at warning protocol and to review whether smaller counties [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  like this have the resources they need to respond to disasters. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  Guys. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=183.83999999999997s)]
*  Very good questions, and we hope to hear the answer to those as soon as possible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  Ryan, I'm curious. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=189.56s)]
*  This area has a history of flooding. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  So I'm wondering how that history compares to what happened this time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=192.92s)]
*  And also this camp, which had such a rich history. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=197.44s)]
*  So many generations of children were sent to that camp. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=202.44s)]
*  And for many of the little girls there, it's their first experience away from home. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  And one of the experiences you have in camp is you don't bring a phone, you don't have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=211.72s)]
*  contact, you learn to live out on your own. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=216.76s)]
*  It just seems unbelievably agonizing and horrific for all the families involved. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=219.4s)]
*  Where were these cabins compared to the Guadalupe River that that flooded so terribly? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=235.68s)]
*  And we haven't been able to lay eyes ourselves on the camp. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=236.68s)]
*  But I'll tell you, I haven't shared this before. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=241.52s)]
*  I was speaking with some of the staff members from Camp Mystic last night. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=244.04s)]
*  No cameras rolling, just trying to learn from their experience. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=248.92s)]
*  I asked them that exact question about the layout of the camp. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=253.84s)]
*  Were these cabins in danger? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=257.4s)]
*  They were not right on the banks of the river. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  They were several hundred feet away, they described. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=262.32s)]
*  That gives you an idea for just how high this river rose. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=266.4s)]
*  And you brought up a great point about the history of flooding here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=270.6s)]
*  To say that this disaster was unprecedented or unpredictable is false. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=275.04s)]
*  Back in 1987, 10 people died when disastrous flooding came through this same area. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=280.92s)]
*  So this is a community that does not underestimate this river. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=288.6s)]
*  This was far worse than it has ever been. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=291.98s)]
*  People didn't think it would be this bad. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=294.3s)]
*  Certainly now there are a lot of questions for how we can better prepare for the future [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=296.86s)]
*  as we continue to grieve the past and all of these families that are now missing their [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=301.86s)]
*  campers and their loved ones, Nika. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=308.06s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Ryan Chandler reporting live from Kerrville, Texas. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=310.94s)]
*  Thank you very much for your reporting this morning. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNDQYjrcsyk&t=315.42s)]
