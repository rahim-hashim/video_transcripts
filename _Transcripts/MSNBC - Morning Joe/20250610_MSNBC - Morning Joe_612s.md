# 'He knows what he's doing': Doctor slams RFK for ousting vaccine panel
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw)
*  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is dismissing all 17 members [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices. The panel acts as a key advisor [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=7.36s)]
*  to the CDC. It assesses the safety and clinical need for vaccines across the country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=14.64s)]
*  Insurance companies and government assistance programs are required to cover vaccines, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=21.44s)]
*  recommended by the panel. Secretary Kennedy announced the move in an opinion piece in the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=26.8s)]
*  Wall Street Journal yesterday, saying this will restore public confidence, as some of the members [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=32.32s)]
*  he is relieving of duty are Biden administration appointees. Officials say the panel will still [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=38.96s)]
*  meet as scheduled at the end of the month, but it is unclear when the new members will be selected. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=45.68s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News medical contributor Dr. Vin Gupta. Dr. Gupta, I guess first of all, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=51.28s)]
*  what might be the impact of this move and was there any other reason that these people could [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=58.32s)]
*  have been dismissed except for the fact that they were appointed by Biden? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=64.48s)]
*  Short answer is no, Mika. You know, if it's still up and it was up two minutes ago, I encourage all [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=70.16s)]
*  your viewers to Google ACIP and the CDC and you'll go to the roster that's still live. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=76.24s)]
*  I'm surprised it's live probably for the next few hours and you can read the bios of the individuals [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  currently on ACIP through June, end of June. These are professors of infectious diseases like Dr. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  Helen Chu at the University of Washington. They're professors of epidemiology like Dr. Jane Zucker [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=94.88s)]
*  at SUNY Downstate, not far from you, and in no way. There are conflicts. Kennedy in his piece at [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=101.36s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal said that there was conflicts of interest, that somehow these [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=107.92s)]
*  individuals are in the pocket of pharma. That's not true. That they have to submit very rigorous [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=112.56s)]
*  conflicts of interest forms that are scrutinized. They cannot hold stock in advisory committees, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=118.48s)]
*  anything to do with vaccine manufacturers. So there is no relationship between any of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=124.4s)]
*  these individuals and their credentials and a conflict of interest, number one. But to your [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=129.12s)]
*  point, what is this going to mean? I'm very close to the American Academy of Pediatrics, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=134.08s)]
*  and we just had a town hall in this conversation in the wake of his announcements over the last [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=141.04s)]
*  few weeks. What does this rolling thunder set of announcements Mika mean for public health? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=145.28s)]
*  And it's pretty darn clear. No clinician likes the fact that he's doing what he's doing. He's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  doing exactly what he said he's been doing. Well, he's doing exactly what he's done for the last 20 [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=156.8s)]
*  years, which is reducing confidence in vaccines. But no clinician wants a lack of transparency [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=160.96s)]
*  and a lack of clear guidelines. That's not expert driven. And that's exactly what he's doing, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  number one. Number two, he also knows that insurance companies rely heavily, Medicaid relies [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  heavily on what ACIP recommends. If ACIP says we need to get a flu booster or MMR every few years, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=178.96s)]
*  they're going to have to cover it. It's actually statutory by law. So he knows what he's doing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=187.44s)]
*  He's actually undermining the very framework of how we get vaccines covered for the American [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  people, including kids. And he's going right at the heart of that. As you say, Dr. Gupta, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=196.08s)]
*  this was all advertised. We knew who Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was, who he's been for the last several [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  years, once a great conservationist, environmentalist, now guided in his public life by vaccine skepticism. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=204.8s)]
*  So you started to get at it, but just for even parents watching at home, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=211.52s)]
*  what could change in their relationship with their doctor, with their pediatrician [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  and vaccines? If this board comes in, we expect filled with fellow vaccine skeptics. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=220.56s)]
*  Well, Willie, you know, what I would say, number one is look at the doctors, so-called doctors, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  that he has surrounded himself with, RSK. These are former doctors who once practiced medicine or [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  doctors in name only who have never practiced the art of medicine at the bedside. And so why does [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  that matter? If you don't have somebody that understands the consequences of something [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  fundamental, like we're going to ruin the vaccine or the infrastructure for people to have access to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=250.0s)]
*  vaccines, if you've never dealt with the consequences of caring for a patient, you're going to run rough [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=255.84s)]
*  shot. You're not going to have accountability. And so that's the phenotype that I worry he is [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=260.72s)]
*  going to surround himself with in government and these types of committees, Willie. What does that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=265.84s)]
*  mean fundamentally? He has this ACIP, a revised ACIP. He can now appoint all new 17 members. He [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  doesn't have to wait till 2028, which was the original deadline that they had to wait till 2028. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=277.44s)]
*  Now he can do it tomorrow if he wanted to or in July. The worry here is that this committee is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=282.55999999999995s)]
*  powerful enough to completely revise the vaccine schedule for children. And he can go on and say, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=289.44s)]
*  in order to this new committee, he can say, you know what, we don't like the recommendations as [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=296.08s)]
*  they exist today. We're going to completely alter them. What does that mean for the everyday family? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=299.52s)]
*  That means that once covered vaccines by insurance companies may go away. Unfortunately, that is part [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=303.52s)]
*  of the risk here, Willie. What I hope, and just to say, I hope insurance companies fundamentally [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=310.8s)]
*  rethink how they cover vaccines because they can no longer rely on ACIP or what the government says. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=318.16s)]
*  So this clearing out of the vaccine committee by RFK Jr. breaks a commitment he apparently made to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Here's what Senator Cassidy said was promised [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  back in February before RFK Jr. was confirmed, followed then by the senator's response to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  reporters yesterday when asked whether he now regrets his vote. He has also committed that he [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  had worked within current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not established [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=347.04s)]
*  parallel systems. It confirmed he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=353.12s)]
*  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations without changes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you regret your vote on RFK Jr.? You can refer to our tweet on that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=364.8s)]
*  I know you asked a different question, but you're trying to give us something similar. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  And I'm not going to comment on that. So Senator Cassidy directing reporters to this statement on [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=376.8s)]
*  social media where he wrote, of course, now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=381.76s)]
*  who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion. I've just spoken with Secretary Kennedy and I'll [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=386.8s)]
*  continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case. So, J-Mart, that first clip we played [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=392.0s)]
*  with Senator Cassidy back on February 4th. What a difference four months makes. He got this guarantee [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=397.76s)]
*  before locking up Senator Cassidy's vote from RFK Jr. that he would not do what he apparently [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=403.04s)]
*  is ready to do. Which was the pivotal vote we should tell folks. If it wasn't for Cassidy on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=408.8s)]
*  the Finance Committee, he wouldn't have gotten confirmed. Cassidy's a doctor, by the way, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  which should remind people. He is a physician and he was anguished over this vote and I think it was [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  very difficult. Classic challenge, politics and principle colliding here, Willie. And [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=422.88s)]
*  he's facing a tough reelection in a deep red state. He already voted to impeach President Trump in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=429.68s)]
*  2021 and I think he came to realize he wouldn't have a chance if he torpedoed Kennedy for the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=434.48s)]
*  cabinet and so he voted to confirm him. But before he did, he did get these assurances. But it turns [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=444.56s)]
*  out, like so many of the cabinet folks, those assurances weren't worth the paper that they were [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=449.36s)]
*  written on and they were only offered those assurances to get through the confirmation [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=454.0s)]
*  process. And now once they're free and once they're out of the purview of the Senate, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=458.0s)]
*  they're going to do whatever they want to do. Just real fast on this, we're talking about the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=462.64s)]
*  riots in LA, which is obviously terrible politics for Democrats. This is a reminder, though, that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=466.24s)]
*  Trump giveth and Trump taketh away, right? Trump will always do stuff and say stuff that is going [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=472.48s)]
*  to alienate people. So yes, it looks terrible to have people in the streets of LA burning American [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=478.8s)]
*  flags, burning cars, but yet Trump has his top appointee get rid of this board of serious doctors [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=484.0s)]
*  to replace it with quacks. It's just a reminder that Trump will always do stuff to keep Democrats [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=492.4s)]
*  in the game somehow. So Dr. Gupta, how concerned or worried should parents and pediatricians be [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=497.92s)]
*  about the future access, availability, and approval of vaccines that are critical to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=505.6s)]
*  children's health as well as adults? Mike, they should be worried. And unfortunately, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=511.52s)]
*  until we start to see a different way for insurance companies to think about a different [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=518.4s)]
*  framework, Mike, in terms of how they cover vaccines, new vaccines, boosters, because right [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=525.12s)]
*  now it is heavily dependent on what Kennedy is hollowing out. ACIP, CDC, FDA recommendations, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=531.36s)]
*  that he has complete control over. He has a lot of authority and power. He is exercising it [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=537.92s)]
*  irresponsibly. But until insurance companies say, you know what, we're going to think about this [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=542.88s)]
*  differently, because by the way, prevention is cheaper. They think about the bottom line, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  unfortunately. Prevention is cheaper than caring for a child in the hospital. That's how they're [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=551.68s)]
*  going to think about it. And in this case, they need to be thinking about the benefits of prevention, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=556.4s)]
*  a political view on evidence. And we need to have a framework here that has not existed [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  in decades, which is them ignoring fundamentally what is coming out of HHS. Mike, unless we see [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=566.16s)]
*  that start to happen, and I suspect we will, if we do not see that start to happen, access is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=572.0s)]
*  going to be significantly hampered. All right. NBC News medical contributor Dr. Vin Gupta, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=576.8s)]
*  thank you very much for your insights this morning. We appreciate it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=583.52s)]
*  Politico's Jonathan Martin, thank you as well. Always good to see you. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=587.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sv2BPmwltw&t=596.16s)]
