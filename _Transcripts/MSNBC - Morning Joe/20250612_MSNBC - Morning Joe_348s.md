# Rev. Al to protesters: Don't play into Trump's hands with violence, conduct non-violent protest
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8)
*  Back here at home, we turn now to protests against the Trump administration's immigration raids. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=0.0s)]
*  They continued in cities across the country last night. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  As the White House says, the agents have arrested more than 300 migrants in Los Angeles since Friday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=8.6s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Liz Kreutz brings us the latest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=14.6s)]
*  Just hours before, a curfew takes effect for a second night in downtown Los Angeles, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=18.6s)]
*  protesters again taking to the streets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=24.3s)]
*  Demonstrations opposing ICE immigration enforcement operations now in their sixth straight day, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=27.0s)]
*  organizers mobilizing across social media. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=32.5s)]
*  How long do you think this is going to go on? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=35.5s)]
*  Well, the National Guard said they're going to be here for at least 30 days, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=37.3s)]
*  so I'd say as long as they're here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=39.7s)]
*  Protests in New York, Denver, and Chicago, where a car appears to speed through a crowd of protesters. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=41.1s)]
*  Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott deploying the National Guard. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=46.9s)]
*  We want to make sure that what has happened in California does not happen in Texas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=51.5s)]
*  Back here in LA, an arrest captured on video. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=56.3s)]
*  Federal agents boxing in this car, drawing their weapons. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=58.9s)]
*  DHS telling us it was a targeted arrest of a violent rioter who punched a Customs and Border Protection officer and attempted to flee. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=62.4s)]
*  DOJ announcing charges against two protesters for allegedly possessing Molotov cocktails, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=69.89999999999999s)]
*  including a man in the U.S. illegally who they say threw this one at police. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=75.7s)]
*  He's now charged with attempted murder. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=80.1s)]
*  And the U.S. attorney reviewing other protest videos. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=82.1s)]
*  They think the mask is saving them. It's not saving them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=85.3s)]
*  We're coming after all these people. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  So let's be clear. This is the beginning, not the end. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, business owners boarding up their stores. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=91.6s)]
*  Some heavily armed and standing guard after the city says more than 20 stores were looted since Friday, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=94.2s)]
*  costing millions of dollars in damage. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=99.7s)]
*  Just next door, dozens of people broke in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=102.5s)]
*  All after another dramatic night in downtown LA. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=106.1s)]
*  Protests again erupting at LA's federal building, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=109.2s)]
*  with some demonstrators then briefly making their way onto a major freeway. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  The police response overwhelming. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  This is not the second time in three days that the highway has been shut down. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=120.1s)]
*  This is Highway 101. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=123.6s)]
*  You can see these patrol cars here stopping southbound traffic during rush hour. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  Police corralling the protesters on a nearby street. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=129.7s)]
*  Okay, we are witnessing now multiple people get arrested here by CHP officers. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=133.1s)]
*  They're out on the freeway blocking traffic, blocking people out on the freeway. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=137.1s)]
*  One by one, the protesters hand zip tied and lined up, preparing to be loaded onto buses. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=139.9s)]
*  This is definitely a change of tactic, what we've seen over the past few days, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=145.0s)]
*  with officers now detaining many protesters. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=149.1s)]
*  As LA gears up for the arrival of Marines deployed by President Trump to protect ICE agents, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=152.5s)]
*  California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom blaming the president for what he called a brazen abuse of power. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=157.5s)]
*  California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=163.4s)]
*  Other states are next. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=166.7s)]
*  Democracy is next. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=168.29999999999998s)]
*  Democracy is under assault before our eyes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=170.6s)]
*  This moment we have feared has arrived. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  The White House firing back. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom fanned the flames and demonized our brave ICE officers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  Instead of defending their city and their state. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  NBC's Liz Kreutz with that report. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's now bring in President of the National Action Network and host of MSNBC's Politics Nation, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  Reverend Al Sharpton and senior writer for The Dispatch, David Drucker. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=194.7s)]
*  David also a Bloomberg columnist. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=198.7s)]
*  Ali Vitale, Richard Haas still with us. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=201.1s)]
*  Rev, we'll begin with you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=204.5s)]
*  Obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the president's deployment to the National Guard, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  now the Marines to Los Angeles and how that in the view of many has escalated the situation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  But let's remember what started all this, which are these ICE raids. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=216.4s)]
*  And those in Los Angeles were saying, look, these aren't, you know, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=219.1s)]
*  for the most part, violent criminals that you're picking up. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  These are people who are our friends, our neighbors, who have been here in some cases for decades. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=224.6s)]
*  And it's that concern, which is going to fuel anti-ICE protests in cities across the country in the coming days. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=228.6s)]
*  In particular this weekend. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=235.5s)]
*  It just feels like potentially a powder cake. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=237.1s)]
*  It feels like it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=240.7s)]
*  And I think the president does not care that he's put us in this position. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=242.1s)]
*  And let's be clear, the president put us in this position. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=247.2s)]
*  When we look at the fact that you are talking about a president who ran on, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=251.2s)]
*  we're going after violent criminals. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=256.1s)]
*  We're getting the worst of the worst out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=257.8s)]
*  And now he's paytaking people that have been here for years, have been taxpayers, have had families here, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=261.4s)]
*  and just grabbing them up in one siege. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=267.8s)]
*  Of course, you're going to have a reaction. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=271.1s)]
*  Now, the reaction should not be violent. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=272.7s)]
*  And for the most part, it has not been violent. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=275.1s)]
*  We have an Office of National Action Network in LA. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=277.7s)]
*  Most of these protests, our people tell us, have been extremely disciplined, angry, but not violent. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=280.4s)]
*  They've also been contained. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=289.0s)]
*  You're talking about a quarter of a mile contained area. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=291.0s)]
*  And you need 700 troops, Marines, to come in for that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=296.4s)]
*  So it really telegraphs what would bring in the National Guard, hundreds of people, the Marines and all. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  The president wants to exacerbate this scene, which is why I have said to people, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=307.8s)]
*  don't play into his hand with violence. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=312.8s)]
*  Do the nonviolent protest, which shows they're the ones that are acting insensitive, not you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=315.2s)]
*  Yeah. As I wrote yesterday, the White House loves images out of Los Angeles. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  We'll see what happens next. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIrnf_G3l8&t=327.2s)]
