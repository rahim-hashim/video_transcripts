# 'He bought every copy': Graydon Carter on the GQ cover story Trump tried to bury
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss)
*  Graydon Carter, so great to have you here. Wonderful to be here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=0.0s)]
*  Incredible book and as you know you're my hero, have I ever told you? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=3.6s)]
*  I mean you have for a long time but why don't we start with you getting the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=8.24s)]
*  news? You thought you were gonna be New Yorker editor and at the last second you [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=13.44s)]
*  found out you were going to be getting Vanity Fair and your response, and I'll [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=18.02s)]
*  say it for you, was oh fuck. Why? Well I said it quietly and not in front of my [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=23.36s)]
*  children and no I met with Sino House who then you know controlled most of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=29.28s)]
*  these sort of cultural engines of New York. He had Random House and Alfred A. Knopf [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=34.4s)]
*  and book publishing, he had all the Conde Nast magazines and magazines and I'd gone [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=39.0s)]
*  to see him and he said would you be interested in either one of these two [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=45.0s)]
*  magazines and he mentioned The New Yorker and Vanity Fair and I said well [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=49.24s)]
*  the trouble is at Spy for the previous five years we'd made fun of The New [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=53.36s)]
*  Yorker, it's like it's house writing style, it's editor, it's some of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=58.08s)]
*  contributors and so he said okay it's The New Yorker and just like that and so I [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=62.28s)]
*  worked out a plan of how I would change the magazine. I'm not a disruptor [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=67.44s)]
*  in any shape or form so I thought incremental changes over six months, 12 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=72.64s)]
*  months, 18 months and the day it was supposed to be announced I got a call [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=76.88s)]
*  from Anna Winter who said it's going to be the other magazine, Vanity Fair I [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=80.84s)]
*  thought and I may have said something like what you just said but at the same [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=86.44s)]
*  time I was so, we so needed the money, I had three kids at that point and two of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=90.84s)]
*  them were in school and we weren't paying ourselves a lot at Spy or the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=95.12s)]
*  New York Observer where I went later and so I said great, I said that's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=99.0s)]
*  terrific but I had no plan, I started probably ten days later without the plan [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=105.88s)]
*  and it took me two years to really sort of get things where I wanted it rather [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=111.16s)]
*  than things where I could just find. And we'll get to the toxic culture that you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=116.52s)]
*  inherited but first I want to talk about what happened when you went over to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Tina's, Tina Brown's place, you knock on the door and legend editor, legendary [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=129.12s)]
*  editor Harry Evans opens the door and Harry says what to you? Well so we went [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=137.4s)]
*  over to Bang it, the news had trickled out and so I wanted to get on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=143.16s)]
*  top of it by issuing a press release so I went over to Tina Brown and Harry [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=148.28s)]
*  Evans apartment over on the east side and I opened the door and Harry Evans [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=152.6s)]
*  opened it said you leaked it and I said no I didn't, I mean I [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=156.76s)]
*  didn't want anything to come out because I thought it would endanger me getting [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=161.6s)]
*  the job. And so they worked on a press release and there was like this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=165.16s)]
*  many paragraphs about Tina Brown's, how incredible she is, she was incredible to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=169.68s)]
*  see who she is, Harry was writing, Harry's typing away, there was a couple little sentences [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=173.68s)]
*  oh and by the way a Canadian guy is going to be taking over the bedroom here. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=178.48s)]
*  So that was my first introduction to the ways of Conde Nast. Yeah, you said the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=183.28s)]
*  first two years, you wrote about the first two years being toxic and it's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=190.4s)]
*  really interesting, you said you're not a disruptor, I remember not being a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  disruptor when I was in Congress, I took over a committee, I said everybody [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=200.24s)]
*  keeps their job, you know it took me about six to nine months to figure out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  that everything I was doing was going back to the old chairman and then going [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=209.56s)]
*  to leadership and so I reluctantly I had to get rid of them but kind of faced the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=214.4s)]
*  same thing at Vanity Fair, didn't you? You inherited this toxic culture that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=219.84s)]
*  wasn't loyal to you. Well no because we had spent five years at [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=225.28s)]
*  Spy Magazine, sort of ridiculing the magazine, so I was the least favorite [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=231.04s)]
*  candidate to show up. Also when new editors come in or new bosses [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=236.72s)]
*  come in, obviously it means unemployment for some of the people but I think I [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=241.32s)]
*  only fired one person in my life up to that point so I let things stay for two [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=246.44s)]
*  years and I thought I'd try to work with everybody and bring them around to my [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=252.48s)]
*  way of thinking and in the end there were three people who just I couldn't [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  get on side and these were people who were leaking about my inadequacies and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=260.12s)]
*  my mistakes to the outside world and to the press so I finally I went into work [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=264.12s)]
*  one day and over like a three-day period I got rid of all of them and I sort [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  of told them I said look you mistook affability for weakness but [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=274.12s)]
*  you know this isn't working for me anymore so the moment I did that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=281.08s)]
*  sort of things changed and like because I want to I like a collegial office I [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=285.04s)]
*  like where people respect each other's talents and say please and thank you [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=289.0s)]
*  and and work together rather than apart and pretty much for the next 23 years [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=294.68s)]
*  with obviously hiccups because we're all human right it worked that way you [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=300.6s)]
*  know it's fascinating isn't it what happens when you treat people well you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=304.88s)]
*  get the best out of them and you also you were able to attract the best of the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  best to bring them into the magazine right well the check size checkbook helped [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=314.04s)]
*  bring them into the magazine as well which by the way the way you describe your your [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=318.88s)]
*  expense accounts at Vanity Fair it's how you guys sound like like this sounds [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=326.76s)]
*  like hammer of the gods like Led Zeppelin type money there there was no [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=331.24s)]
*  budget you just you know there wasn't in the first couple of years and there were [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  there were budgets but there were healthy budgets no sigh was very smart [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=338.92s)]
*  he he he tooks the time it Connie and asked which had been a third tier [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=342.72s)]
*  publisher when I came to New York in the 1970s it was sort of a finishing school [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  magazine company then there was Hearst above it and then time ink at the top [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  and by attracting talent by buying magazines like the New Yorker and GQ [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=356.0s)]
*  and then by launching magazines like Vanity Fair which he relaunched in 1983 [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=363.16s)]
*  he took Connie Nass into the absolute top tier and he didn't spend money [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=368.32s)]
*  crazily he wanted Connie Nass have seemed like this sort of hallowed ground [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=373.68s)]
*  where everybody wanted to work and people did want to work there because [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=377.8s)]
*  well because it was quite lavish right and because you could do great things [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=382.44s)]
*  there either the New Yorker or Vanity Fair or Vogue or GQ that you couldn't do [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=387.32000000000005s)]
*  another magazine so it was the size checkbook helped getting you know get [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  talent into the tent but then I appreciated every single thing they do [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  because you and I can go out and take a nice picture of a sailboat at sunset [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=403.02000000000004s)]
*  but a professional photographer has to go out every single day or every [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=407.32s)]
*  week and bring back great epic pictures and by the same notion being an editor [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=412.2s)]
*  is quite an easy job you're kind of a you know desk jockey it's not an easy [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  job it's easier than being a writer and going off to far corners of the world [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=424.12s)]
*  where people are shooting at you and bringing up bringing back a big narrative [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=428.2s)]
*  but at the same time though I want to I want to get to Sinew House because I [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=431.96s)]
*  don't really know that much about him a little before my time and what made him [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=436.08s)]
*  so remarkable such a remarkable publisher but first I want to ask you [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=441.44s)]
*  about why you were a successful editor you said that you could read any [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=446.8s)]
*  magazine and tell the difference between a complacent editor and an anxious editor [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  explain that well that because there was any any golden age I assume is the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=459.44s)]
*  golden age because of competition and during that 40 year period of magazine [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=465.56s)]
*  golden aged them in New York especially the competition was fierce there were a [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=473.08s)]
*  lot of great editors out there and often we'll be fighting over the same stories [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=477.56s)]
*  this or the same writers or photographers or advertisers and so that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=482.08s)]
*  kept you on your toes there was never a moment where you can sit back and say we [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=486.68s)]
*  did it not it not a single moment if you put out a really great issue you'd sort [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=490.92s)]
*  of worry that that's as good as it's ever going to get and if you put out a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  sort of secondary issue you'd worry that you've lost your touch so and our [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=499.44s)]
*  competition a lot of our competition was weekly in the New Yorker Time and News [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  Week and then we compete against the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=509.52000000000004s)]
*  and the Washington Post for news stories and we were this big lumbering monthly [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  that if I assigned a story in let's say May I probably couldn't get it into the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=519.32s)]
*  magazine much before September because it would take a couple of months to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=525.2800000000001s)]
*  report and write a month to edit fact-check go through legal review then [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=528.24s)]
*  you lay the whole thing out then you have to print it staple it ship it and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=532.88s)]
*  then you wait for these guys on the newsstands to open the boxes so you had [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=537.7600000000001s)]
*  to like think of stories that would have currency three four five months six [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=541.6400000000001s)]
*  months evergreen yeah yes so and they would often be based on the news but [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=547.72s)]
*  they'd be sort of the the narrative stories that that you could produce [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=553.48s)]
*  before the book version of that that news event came out but you're editing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=558.84s)]
*  process you I take it you were an anxious editor you said you look at every [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=564.9200000000001s)]
*  word you everywhere every word before I mean it was just complete quality [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=570.08s)]
*  control every you could do that with a monthly weekly editor couldn't do that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=574.72s)]
*  right the monthly editor could and it was very appreciative of the writers and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=578.72s)]
*  then there's job is to sort of try to get all the right you've got all these [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=582.0s)]
*  different voices but make an issue of a magazine come out like a chorus with the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=584.6s)]
*  you know highs and lows and hey is the constant job was like sitting you down [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=589.2s)]

*  but you said nobody would have expected you to ever succeed so so what what I [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=715.8s)]
*  always love asking artists and great editors and great because why why why [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=723.16s)]
*  did you get out of Canada why did you why were you able to wrestle the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=730.44s)]
*  Canadian review why were you able to get to New York what was it in you that [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=735.48s)]
*  first of all it kept propelling you forward through the boneyard of failures [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=742.12s)]
*  as you would say I'm gonna ask that then I'm gonna ask what made you a great [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=747.84s)]
*  editor but first of all personally how how did you get from there to here well [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=751.1600000000001s)]
*  I was not a great student I was always distracted by I played a lot of hockey I [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=754.8s)]
*  skied all the time I you even said that if your class was reading this is what I [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=761.16s)]
*  really could relate to if your class was reading Beowulf you'd pick up him [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=766.64s)]
*  Hemingway I was reading something else and I mean and so I stumbled upon a [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=770.88s)]
*  magazine when I was in college these guys were starting up a literary [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=776.52s)]
*  political magazine and they were and they were looking for an art director I [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=780.56s)]
*  said well I can draw and they said okay you're the art director and anyway [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=785.4s)]
*  little magazines are just festering Petri dishes of bitterness and feud them [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=789.3599999999999s)]
*  right and you can I mean you can fit most people the staff at this table but [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  they were always fighting it's like Henry Kissinger said of academia the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=799.2399999999999s)]
*  reason why the fights the stakes are so low are so high are so great because [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=803.1999999999999s)]
*  the stakes are so one thing with magazines huh exactly the same so [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=807.48s)]
*  eventually I became the editor after about a year and a half or so and it was [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=811.8000000000001s)]
*  a magazine run by people had never worked at a magazine before which is [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=816.9200000000001s)]
*  painfully evident to both the advertisers and the readers but it was a [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=820.08s)]
*  magazine and I learned how to learn how to do certain things and how not to do [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=824.22s)]
*  certain things and we eventually sold it to our closest competitor and other that [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=828.6s)]
*  I was able to come to New York get a job as a writer at Time magazine because New [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=834.92s)]
*  York was just a huge draw for me some people would be Los Angeles some people [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=839.9599999999999s)]
*  in Paris New York was the it was the golden city for me and it still is right [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=843.68s)]
*  and one other could there's a great that's wonderful critic the Washington [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=850.36s)]
*  Post Virginia Heffernan she's committed she said so many writers who write about [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=854.0s)]
*  New York and they're sort of you know negative and they're like looking back [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=858.28s)]
*  on the sort of rough parts she said grains more like buddy in elf which I [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=861.56s)]
*  thought a offensive be really funny see absolutely true yeah and you and you [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=866.28s)]
*  loved New York I tell people now that are walking around New York and and it's [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=872.76s)]
*  it's safe and it's safe ish not as safe as it was pre-covid but it's safe ish I [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=877.4s)]
*  say you should have seen it in the mid 70s it was it was horrible it was a [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  sewage pit and you loved it you loved every second I used to live on this [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=890.4399999999999s)]
*  block and every morning I go take the dog for a walk and to be shattered glass [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=895.68s)]
*  on the pavement from a car being broken into and if you remember that time [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=900.9599999999999s)]
*  people would put no radio on their cars you know those little signs on the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=904.76s)]
*  windows yes up so people wouldn't break when they take the radio out at night so [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=908.1999999999999s)]
*  in New York is very safe now but that has been part of you know there in New [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=911.64s)]
*  York and I don't think New York's ever been as safe as Milwaukee say right but [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=917.52s)]
*  yeah so so you came to New York and and as we said get to Vanity Fair and I'm [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=922.8s)]
*  curious what as an editor what's the difference if you were if you were [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=930.16s)]
*  giving advice to a young editor today what would you say made the difference [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=934.72s)]
*  for you and would make the difference for them I think treating the writer [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=939.6s)]
*  really well because the writer has that hard job and working closely with them [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=942.76s)]
*  but then also trying to assign stories to writers who can do the best job of the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=947.04s)]
*  stories and that was sort of a selection process and you look for stories with [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=952.04s)]
*  the big arcs you know beginning middle and end that you have an ending to a [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=956.24s)]
*  story that's a real help if we just have a beginning in the middle it's less [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=960.12s)]
*  satisfying to the reader and I always believed we were in the service industry [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=963.88s)]
*  and I still believe I'm in the service industry and that service industry is to [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=967.48s)]
*  like give something to you that's as pleasing as I can humanly put together [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=971.48s)]
*  with all the resources I have at hand and I want you to read this magazine so [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=976.0s)]

*  because they're better looking than the rest of us and because it's the there [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=984.92s)]
*  were the sort of global currency of the newsstand so you you know it's just like [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=988.92s)]
*  being a chef at a restaurant I just want to give you something as good as I [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=994.44s)]

*  I'd go inside I think it's just magic I mean it was it was just it was mad we [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1015.92s)]
*  did a good job but I had a phenomenal staff and we worked together for most [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1021.84s)]
*  of us for 25 years and you then that's a big thing it's just a consistency of [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1025.68s)]
*  staff because you start knowing each other's weaknesses and strengths and I [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1030.24s)]
*  had enough people anytime I saw any employee walking down the hall with [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1033.88s)]

*  people who are rookies and and so it was and I thought I could do something and [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1609.46s)]
*  we've got a great readership I wanted beautiful advertising and excuse me I [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1617.02s)]
*  wrote a thank-you letter to every advertiser every month no well for 25 [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1622.02s)]
*  years of Vanity Fair and sometimes we'd have you know hundred and 125 [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1626.82s)]
*  advertisers in an issue and I wrote also wrote thank-you notes to every writer [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1631.9399999999998s)]
*  and photographer and illustrator and that made a big difference when I [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1635.58s)]
*  started airmail because I had a personal connection to our advertisers do you [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1639.86s)]

*  to do that I've got to do because an email just doesn't cut it doesn't I send [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1648.62s)]
*  an electrogram which is a business my wife set up and it looks like a [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1653.34s)]
*  telegram right but it comes electronically and it's instantly [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1656.3s)]
*  because I don't have the apparatus to send out all these notes and nobody [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1659.3799999999999s)]

*  of the internet you could do it from anywhere and if if there had if there [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1682.14s)]
*  if there had been an internet in the 1920s Harold Ross would never have [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1686.3400000000001s)]
*  printed the New Yorker and I don't think Henry Luce would have printed time they [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1690.46s)]
*  would have just done it on the internet this way yeah so you were ahead of the [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1695.66s)]

*  out of the US for most of Trump's first administration and that having that [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1728.18s)]

*  know gangland gunfight war and so I think the I think there'll be a massive [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1740.18s)]
*  brain drain from the United States because if you're a foreign student and [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1746.42s)]
*  you're maybe a research scientist or a medical student the danger being just [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1749.9s)]

*  would have never gotten the enrollment will go up in all those schools I think [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1769.98s)]
*  and so it's terrifying right now this is this is the darkest time I think since [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1773.46s)]
*  the 1950s and you know the sort of getting lawyer the giant legal firms like [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1778.1s)]

*  share many things in common one of them is we both have been blamed at times for [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1804.74s)]
*  the rise of Donald Trump I want you to explain you I don't blame well I think [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1810.86s)]
*  no blame you actually blame yourself in the book but it's hilarious in the story [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1816.3799999999999s)]
*  it all started with a GQ cover story you didn't want to do tell us about that [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1821.6599999999999s)]
*  well I needed the money always needed the money and so I did a story on you [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPEYNaWiQss&t=1825.9399999999998s)]
