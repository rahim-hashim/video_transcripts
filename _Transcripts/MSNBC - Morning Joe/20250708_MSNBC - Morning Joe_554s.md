# 'Trump is ushering in America's ICE age': Columnist WARNS of  'ominous' security state
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y)
*  18 past the hour, nearly 100 National Guard troops and dozens of federal officers descended [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  on MacArthur Park in Los Angeles yesterday, a majority immigrant neighborhood known as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=7.12s)]
*  the Ellis Island of the West Coast. The park was nearly empty as officials moved through [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=12.52s)]
*  in military vehicles and on horseback for about an hour before abruptly leaving. Local [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=18.72s)]
*  officials said the operation seemed designed to sow fear in the community. Los Angeles [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=25.72s)]
*  Mayor Karen Bass witnessed the operation in person and slammed the move on social media, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=31.52s)]
*  calling it quote, absolutely outrageous. The Department of Homeland Security refused to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=38.32s)]
*  say whether anyone had been arrested and would not comment on ongoing enforcement operations. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  This comes weeks after thousands of demonstrators marched in LA and around the country to protest [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=50.32s)]
*  increased immigration enforcement. Jonathan. More of these types of maneuvers in blue cities [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=57.72s)]
*  we saw from LA, much of the outrage of officials there who also have expressed real concerns [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=66.56s)]
*  about that city's economy because they rely so much on some of these migrants doing jobs [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=70.4s)]
*  around the city who are now afraid to show their face. Joining us now, U.S. National [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=75.36s)]
*  Editor at the Financial Times, Ed Loos. Ed, good to see you. Your latest piece is titled [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=80.52s)]
*  Trump's Omnis-Ice Security State. We want to get right to it. Here's part of what you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=85.6s)]
*  wrote. The nation of immigrants shift to mass deportation is among the most anticipated [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=90.8s)]
*  turns in U.S. history. Trump has for years compared undocumented migrants to animals. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=96.7s)]
*  During the 2024 campaign, he even claimed that Haitians living in a small town in Ohio [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=103.54s)]
*  were eating each other, each other people's pets. Though there is nothing glacial about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  it, Trump is ushering in America's ice age. He has catapulted ice into America's best [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=115.34s)]
*  funded law enforcement agency and increasingly beyond accountability. The agency's in-house [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=120.92s)]
*  watchdog was scrapped earlier this year. For the time being, the lower courts can do little [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=127.34s)]
*  to rein it in. The Supreme Court last year gave Trump sweeping immunity from official [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=132.88000000000002s)]
*  acts he takes as president. That makes ICE Trump's de facto private army, his security [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=138.08s)]
*  state within the state. So, Ed, talk to us more about this. You saw those images and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=145.46s)]
*  outraged what we saw in Los Angeles, not limited to the mayor's office there. A lot of elected [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=152.08s)]
*  leaders suggested this was an unnecessary show of force meant to simply intimidate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=156.70000000000002s)]
*  There's also, of course, the debate about ICE agents, whether or not they should be [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=160.66s)]
*  able to wear masks as they conduct their rounds. Talk to us more about what worries you about [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=163.14s)]
*  ICE, which is now, thanks to the so-called One Big Beautiful bill, is going to have even [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=171.1s)]
*  more money at its disposal. Yeah, I mean, it's a really vexing and important [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=175.18s)]
*  question that this agency that's going to go from $9 billion to $30-something billion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=180.34s)]
*  a year budget, recruit 10,000 new agents, get, as we saw in MacArthur Park yesterday, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=187.58s)]
*  all the tactical gear and armor personnel carriers it needs, that scene in MacArthur [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=195.26s)]
*  Park with choppers and drones overhead, horse formations from the National Guard and ICE, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=200.46s)]
*  is clearly an attempt to intimidate people to self-deport. They want to frighten people, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=208.46s)]
*  sow fears into these communities so that they don't have to put them into one of these [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=218.06s)]
*  new alligator Alcatraz detention camps, that they will just leave the country through fear. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=223.62s)]
*  So what we have is a fear campaign, which is going to escalate, and I think Bodes is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=230.38s)]
*  extremely worrying for the future of U.S. rule of law, people's confidence in law enforcement, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=237.94s)]
*  and as you mentioned, the fact that they are still not obliged to identify themselves or [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=247.5s)]
*  show their faces just underlines how alarming this situation is. It's happening very, very [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=251.94s)]
*  quickly. And Ed, speak a little further, if you will, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=259.54s)]
*  about your concerns, how the Trump might even use this force, other federal agencies, to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=262.5s)]
*  target his political opponents. We have seen a number of elected officials, Democrat elected [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=266.26s)]
*  officials, be arrested at some of these facilities or at protests, or in New York City. A mayoral [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=271.18s)]
*  candidate who was simply at an immigration court hearing was detained for four hours, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=277.62s)]
*  and we now have Trump, whose lawyers have challenged the birthright citizenship in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=282.7s)]
*  Constitution. He's even suggesting that he would try to deport the Democratic nominee [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=289.34s)]
*  for mayor in New York, Zoran Mamdani. Yeah, and so, you know, this is going to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=294.9s)]
*  be a story on and off of the Supreme Court, because ultimately, you know, they're going [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=300.9s)]
*  to have to rule on some of these questions, including whether the president has the right [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=304.82s)]
*  to remove citizenship from naturalized Americans. And of course, Zoran Mamdani is a naturalized [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=309.97999999999996s)]
*  American. Trump has indeed dropped the hint that he's prepared to consider removing his [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=317.18s)]
*  citizenship. The detention centers, this $45 billion that ICE has got to build lots [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=321.98s)]
*  of alligator alcatrazs around the country, under the law, lawmakers, members of Congress, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=331.54s)]
*  have the right to visit them, to check on reports that they're inhumane and not providing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=338.02000000000004s)]
*  sort of basic provisions to their inmates. ICE has ignored that law and said they have [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  to give 72 hours notice. Now, that Supreme Court ruling on the 27th, where the Trump [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=352.85999999999996s)]
*  administration succeeded in getting the Supreme Court to say they can ignore lower court stays [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=360.02s)]
*  and injunctions, that means that ICE can continue to do things like this, can continue to decide [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=366.18s)]
*  to disguise their identity, can continue to have military-style maneuvers in children's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=375.02s)]
*  playgrounds without any fear of legal recourse. And so, of course, this is a tool that Trump's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=380.5s)]
*  going to use. Imagine that MacArthur Park scene around polling stations in November [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=391.62s)]
*  2026. Imagine whatever pretext is used for them to declare in a swing state or in a swing [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=399.62s)]
*  county that there are national security concerns with illegals. And what effect that would [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=407.38s)]
*  have on voting turnout. You don't really need to use your imagination. We're seeing dress [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=414.18s)]
*  rehearsals for that kind of thing in MacArthur Park and elsewhere. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=419.18s)]
*  You know, one more item here. We're also following the latest from Texas where border patrol [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=424.82s)]
*  agents and an armed suspect exchanged gunfire yesterday. NBC News correspondent Kathy Park [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  has the details on that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=438.22s)]
*  A border patrol facility in McAllen, Texas on high alert after a shooter armed with a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=440.66s)]
*  rifle opened fire. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=445.74s)]
*  We received a call in McAllen, P.D. at about 5.50 this morning of a person basically assaulting [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=447.62s)]
*  and attacking the federal building. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=454.7s)]
*  Officials say federal agents fired back and helped neutralize the shooter. During the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=457.65999999999997s)]
*  deadly exchange, the McAllen police chief saying an officer was injured. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=461.94s)]
*  There were many, many, many dozens of rounds fired from by the suspect towards the building [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=466.06s)]
*  and towards agents in that building. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=471.34s)]
*  Authorities identifying the suspect as 27-year-old Ryan Lewis Mosqueda, who they say had other [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=473.7s)]
*  weapons and more ammunition. The police chief said Mosqueda was reported missing your McAllen. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=478.24s)]
*  After arriving in a vehicle with Michigan license plates, which also displayed a spray-painted [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=484.06s)]
*  Latin phrase, cordis die, or day of the heart. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=488.9s)]
*  When someone drives onto a parking lot and opens fire, there is some premeditation involved [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=492.54s)]
*  as far as I'm concerned. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=497.46s)]
*  Near McAllen, Westlaco police say they stopped Mosqueda's father for a traffic violation [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=498.74s)]
*  just before 4 a.m., who claimed his son Ryan Mosqueda was missing and had a mental deficiency. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=503.22s)]
*  Police say no documentation was provided to support that claim. His father also telling [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=509.74s)]
*  authorities Ryan Mosqueda had weapons in his vehicle. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=514.4s)]
*  Officials assuring the public there's no longer an active threat, but growing questions about [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=518.0600000000001s)]
*  the suspect's possible motive and if anyone else may have been involved in the attack. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZe_i9EIT0Y&t=522.54s)]
