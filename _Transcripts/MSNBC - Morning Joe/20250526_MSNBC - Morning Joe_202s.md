**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ)
*  Meanwhile, police in New York City this morning are investigating a kidnapping case involving [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  a man known as the Crypto King of Kentucky, who is accused of holding another man hostage [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=4.84s)]
*  for weeks in an effort to steal his digital currency. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=10.36s)]
*  A very 2025 case, I guess. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in NBC News correspondent Emily Aketa. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=16.44s)]

*  What more can you tell us? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=20.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, the details are equally as shocking as they are disturbing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=21.96s)]
*  John Waltz is accused of assaulting an Italian tourist and even dangling him from the ledge [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=24.88s)]
*  of a swanky apartment in an effort to gain access to his bitcoin. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=28.96s)]
*  And we're now learning from law enforcement sources an alleged accomplice in the Brazen [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=33.0s)]
*  Act is expected to turn himself in to detectives this week. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=36.6s)]
*  This upscale New York City townhome, now the site of a high profile police investigation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=42.8s)]
*  Authorities say 37 year old crypto investor John Waltz and an unnamed accomplice kidnapped [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=48.92s)]
*  and tortured their business partner for weeks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  John, did you kidnap that tourist? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=56.6s)]
*  The alleged victim, a 28 year old man from Italy, targeted, according to investigators, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  in a twisted scheme to steal his bitcoin. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=64.12s)]
*  Waltz known as the Crypto King of Kentucky is facing multiple charges, including assault, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=67.88s)]
*  kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Law enforcement sources say Waltz and his accomplice, who is now wanted by police, have [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  been in business with the alleged victim for years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=80.2s)]
*  What happened in those two weeks? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  According to the criminal complaint, the accuser told investigators on May 6th, Waltz and the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=86.0s)]
*  unapprehended male allegedly took away his passport and electronic devices and threatened [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=90.64s)]
*  his family before they subjected him to weeks of torture inside the residence that included [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=95.84s)]
*  beatings, striking him in the head with a gun and hanging him over the ledge of a staircase [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=101.6s)]
*  when they threatened to kill him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=106.3s)]
*  All of it in an alleged attempt to access his bitcoin account. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=108.88s)]
*  According to law enforcement sources, his net worth is $30 million, while Waltz's is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=112.8s)]
*  close to $100 million. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  It's crazy, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  It's medieval. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=121.6s)]
*  It comes amid a spate of shocking attacks against wealthy crypto entrepreneurs around [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=122.8s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=127.16s)]
*  Earlier this month, a brazen attempted kidnapping on the streets of Paris, where local media [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=128.16s)]
*  reported the daughter of a cryptocurrency businessman was targeted. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=133.04s)]
*  In Houston, police say an influencer was assaulted at her home in March when several robbers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=137.32s)]
*  demanded access to her crypto account. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=142.22s)]
*  In this latest suspected attack over digital assets, the Italian tourist was able to escape [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=144.82s)]
*  after 17 days and alert a traffic agent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=150.16s)]
*  Police later descending on the six-story house and arresting Waltz, taken into custody barefoot [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=154.14s)]
*  and wearing a bathrobe. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  And law enforcement sources tell us investigators found several pictures in the house that appear [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=162.42s)]
*  to show the victim being tortured. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=166.38s)]
*  They say he was covered in cuts and bruises when he escaped. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=167.88s)]
*  An attorney for John Waltz declined to comment on the investigation when we reached out to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=171.18s)]
*  him. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  He'll be back in court on Wednesday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  Such a wild story. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for bringing it to us this morning. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  NBC News correspondent Emily Akita. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E42jn1i4yfQ&t=178.78s)]
