# Trump, Netanyahu will disagree on the way forward in Iran, says expert
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA)
*  Joining us now, contributing editor for the National Financial Times Kim Katas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=0.0s)]
*  She is also a contributing writer at the Atlantic and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  for International Peace, Karim Sajibourg. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=9.48s)]
*  He focuses on Iran and U.S. foreign policy towards the Middle East. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=11.92s)]
*  Our thanks to you both for being here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Karim, I'll start with you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=17.72s)]
*  Your assessment as to what you're seeing right now in these early days of this campaign. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=19.88s)]
*  Israel does, as we've been discussing all morning, appears to see an opening here, partially [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=25.16s)]
*  with Hamas and Hezbollah so weakened they haven't been able to retaliate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=29.0s)]
*  Yes, Iran did land some missiles in Israel overnight. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=32.44s)]
*  There have been some people killed and injuries there. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  But Tehran, this is the weakest they've been in a long time and it seems that Israel really [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=39.44s)]
*  sees an opening. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=42.8s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=45.32s)]
*  Israel obviously has a huge military, financial, intelligence and diplomatic advantage over [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=46.56s)]
*  Iran. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=53.2s)]
*  There's no question that Israel can prevail in a head-to-head war. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=54.84s)]
*  I think the big question is what starts to happen as the dust settles. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=58.36s)]
*  Number one, what does this do to the stability of the Iranian regime, in particular the future [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=64.64s)]
*  of the 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Obviously this is a regime which is deeply unpopular. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=75.44s)]
*  But we know from history that when authoritarian regimes collapse, it's not only pressure from [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=79.44s)]
*  below but also divisions and fissures at the top. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=84.48s)]
*  And so far we haven't seen any elite fissures inside Iran. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=87.72s)]
*  And then the second obvious question is how does Iran choose to respond with its nuclear [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=91.36s)]
*  program? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=96.52s)]
*  Up until now they've taken a very deliberate approach towards a nuclear weapons capability. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=97.52s)]
*  They may decide that they need to make a dash now either covertly or overtly for nuclear [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=102.52s)]
*  weapons. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=107.72s)]
*  Kim, I'm curious how stable the regime will remain. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=108.72s)]
*  In Iran we obviously have seen revolts against the regime over the past 10, 15 years, from [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=115.92s)]
*  the Green Revolution to young women in particular protesting against Iranian leadership. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=123.72s)]
*  What impact do you think that's going to have as this fighting continues and the regime [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=131.6s)]
*  shows weakness? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=136.08s)]
*  Joe, I think that two things might happen and it might evolve in two different ways. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=138.28s)]
*  The regime is to some extent obviously under attack, feels weakened. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=145.7s)]
*  But I don't think we should expect it to capitulate, which is what Benjamin Netanyahu would like [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=149.78s)]
*  to see as the end result of his military campaign. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=157.06s)]
*  I think the more likely scenario there is, as Karim indicates, there might be fissures [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=160.42s)]
*  at the top. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=165.38s)]
*  And then when it comes to the people, I think people are quite anxious about what is happening. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=166.89999999999998s)]
*  They may dislike, hate this Islamic Republic that has made the lives of millions of Iranians, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=171.9s)]
*  especially the youth, so miserable. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=178.46s)]
*  But I'm not sure they want to be liberated by an Israeli military campaign. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=181.26s)]
*  Opinions will be divided. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=187.34s)]
*  It's a terrifying thing to be in a war. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=188.58s)]
*  And a lot of Iranians will remember eight years of war between Iran and Iraq and how [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=191.3s)]
*  they were abandoned by the rest of the world. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=197.3s)]
*  But I think the key thing to look at here is what is the strategy? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=199.82s)]
*  What is really Benjamin Netanyahu's strategy beyond a tactically spectacular opening blow? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  That's not how the war will be judged. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  It will be judged by how it ends. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  And if it ends in chaos, then there will be no success at all, neither for the Iranians [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=215.94s)]
*  nor for the region. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think that where Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump are going to disagree [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=222.78s)]
*  is on the way forward. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=228.82s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, as I said, I think wants capitulation, which is not a word that is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=230.5s)]
*  in the lexicon of this Iranian regime. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=234.7s)]
*  And President Trump is going to want negotiations, I believe, fairly soon. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=237.42s)]
*  And I want to point out one more thing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=242.82s)]
*  On October 7th, we heard from Benjamin Netanyahu, a lot of Israeli officials, that this was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=245.34s)]
*  the start of a war that would transform the Middle East. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=250.14s)]
*  What we've had so far is definitely some key successes, the weakening of Hezbollah, the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=254.68s)]
*  fall of the regime of Assad, which was a byproduct of everything that's happened over the last [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=262.12s)]
*  year. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  But in Gaza, there's no capitulation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  There's devastation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=269.4s)]
*  It's been over 15 months, and there's no result there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=270.4s)]
*  And this statement by Benjamin Netanyahu on October 7th comes from the man, Benjamin [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=274.28s)]
*  Netanyahu, who in 2002 advocated for the war against Iraq and said that the removal [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=278.64s)]
*  of Saddam would be a walk in the park and would bring very positive development in the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  region. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=289.32s)]
*  Now, I think he might come back and argue, well, 20 years later, here we are. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=290.32s)]
*  It is starting to become a success. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=293.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=295.96s)]
*  You know, Kim, it's fascinating. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=296.96s)]
*  The question that you're raising about Iran, people like David Ignatius, and I'm sure you [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  and others were asking about Israel the day after the October 7th attacks. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=305.84s)]
*  OK, we understand you are going to attack the leadership. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  What's your plan for the day after the war? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=314.52s)]
*  That still hasn't been articulated by Benjamin Netanyahu, whether it's in Gaza or anywhere [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=318.0s)]
*  else in the region. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=322.67999999999995s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, Kim, a question I asked Keir Simmons a few minutes ago, and that is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  about the Sunni Arab nations' response to what's going on in this war. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  Of course, condemnations publicly, but privately, obviously states like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=335.28s)]
*  the UAE, not weeping for what's going on with Iran, who has considered themselves to be [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=345.2s)]
*  their implacable foes for quite some time. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  Talk about that balancing act and where you think most of these Sunni Arab nations are [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  right now as this war escalates. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=364.24s)]
*  I'd make three quick points, Joe. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=369.12s)]
*  I think quiet satisfaction to see Iran knock down another layer. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=371.28s)]
*  This is a country that they've been at odds with for 40 years. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=377.48s)]
*  Anxiety about the fact that the US could get involved or they could get dragged in or they [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=381.52s)]
*  might face the ire of the Iranians with missiles launched at oil facilities, et cetera. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=387.88s)]
*  And then generally a sense that they all want to get on with business. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=393.12s)]
*  You know, we saw President Trump's visit to the Middle East. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  It was all about big, beautiful deals. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=399.96s)]
*  And now we're in a regional war with no clear endgame in sight. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=401.79999999999995s)]
*  So I think it's very conflicted what they're feeling. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=407.24s)]
*  And I think they probably would like negotiations to get underway fairly soon, if not within [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=411.88s)]
*  days, then within weeks. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=417.88s)]
*  But I'm sure Kareem has some great insights there, too. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=419.44s)]
*  And in fact, Kareem will tee you up on exactly that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=423.0s)]
*  What are you looking for here in these next crucial few days? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=425.76s)]
*  Well, a big question is going to obviously be America's disposition. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=429.84s)]
*  Does America continue to give Israel leeway to carry out this operation or are they going [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=434.64s)]
*  to be under pressure, the Israelis to wrap things up? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=441.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't think even with the benefit of hindsight that, as Kim alluded to, this is a regime [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=445.36s)]
*  which feels that if you capitulate under pressure, that doesn't alleviate the pressure against [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=451.36s)]
*  you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=457.36s)]
*  It only projects weakness and invites more of it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=458.36s)]
*  So I think we're going to be in this situation for a while. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=460.36s)]
*  And the big question, as you've spoken about this morning, is if Iran decides to advance [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=463.36s)]
*  its nuclear program at the underground facility of Fordow, President Trump is likely going [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=471.56s)]
*  to have to get involved directly because Israel doesn't have yet the capacity to take out [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=478.56s)]
*  those facilities. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=485.56s)]
*  And my understanding from talking to American military commanders is that the process of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=486.56s)]
*  getting Israel, both the B-52 bomber and the bunker busters, is not Amazon Prime. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=490.56s)]
*  It's not something that arrives in a couple of days. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=497.56s)]
*  It's at least a six-month process. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=499.76s)]
*  And so even though I think President Trump began his administration thinking he just [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=502.76s)]
*  wants to bring peace, do diplomatic deals, he may, like other past U.S. presidents, get [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=505.76s)]
*  sucked into the Middle East. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=513.76s)]
*  A really important conversation. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=515.76s)]
*  We're grateful to you both. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=517.76s)]
*  Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Karim Sajjapour, and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=518.76s)]
*  contributing writer at The Atlantic and contributing editor at The Financial Times, Kim Katas. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=522.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQyrk3PkYZA&t=529.56s)]
