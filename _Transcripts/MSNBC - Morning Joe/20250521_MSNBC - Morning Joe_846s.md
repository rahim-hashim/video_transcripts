# Anand Giridharadas: Democrats vowed change after November; it hasn't come
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU)
*  On and your latest piece for the Inc is entitled the reckoning that wasn't tell us what you mean by that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=0.0s)]
*  So I think last week it was six months since the election in November that stunned a lot of people [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=7.86s)]
*  And it occurred to me that back then in November. There was a lot of talk about reckoning in a lot of different places [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=14.32s)]
*  progressives movement spaces [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=21.14s)]
*  Democratic Party leaders [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Centrist groups like third way the press [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Something has we're not seeing certain things [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=29.900000000000002s)]
*  How could this happen again in America? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=33.54s)]
*  There's a lot of promised reckoning reflection introspection and six months on I kind of took a survey of you know those things [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=35.54s)]
*  I've been in a lot of those rooms over the last six months, and I have to say this was the reckoning that wasn't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Reflecting on so many of those conversations in public and in private over the last six months [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=48.42s)]
*  It struck me that in so many of these worlds with a promise reckoning the promise rethinking [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=52.74s)]
*  What should our party be? What should what is a pro-democracy movement look like? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=58.06s)]
*  What should the press function like there was kind of a smugness and a defensiveness and I know we're doing everything [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=61.22s)]
*  The Democratic establishment well, I think you go down the list smugness so so start with the Democratic Party, right, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=67.7s)]
*  which [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=73.82000000000001s)]
*  Should really at the be at the top of the list of what is a profound? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=74.98s)]
*  Rethinking of what it means to have a pro-democracy party when you're running against that because someone you know [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=80.22s)]
*  Going after Medicaid as we were talking about [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=86.06s)]
*  And you've had no real rethinking you've had you know individual leaders reaching out to people saying what do we do? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=88.38s)]
*  What do we do, but anybody who's tried to change anything? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  David Hogg others the DNC kicked out they picked a very lackluster chair [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=96.66s)]
*  I would say the other you know you look at the progressive movement space where I've also spent time [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=101.7s)]
*  No real reckoning there. You know you have just a continued sense of what everything we're doing is perfect [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=106.9s)]
*  Let's just do you know the land acknowledgments and all this academic jargony stuff that no one understands that alienates [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  People that don't understand what those things are [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=118.42s)]
*  No reckoning there, I think you have you know [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=122.42s)]
*  leaders individual Democratic leaders who have just been completely [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=126.42s)]
*  Disappointing to most people watching this who have not stood up not showed spine people have raised their voices thing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=131.34s)]
*  I hear most from people you haven't had one leadership shuffle. You haven't had one new leader [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=136.94s)]
*  You have not anybody say you know what I'm not adequate to this moment [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=141.5s)]
*  and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=144.5s)]
*  You know I this sounds like a very negative analysis [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=145.78s)]
*  And it is but I think what I wanted to call people's attention to is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=148.22s)]
*  There's a risk of becoming Trump like in opposing Trump [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=152.18s)]
*  There's a risk in becoming as defensive as smug as self-certain as incurious [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=155.66s)]
*  Incuriosity was sort of the thing I found the most and all these people and institutions who said we have to we have to look [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=162.18s)]
*  At ourselves no one as far as I can tell ended up really looking at themselves [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=167.5s)]
*  And no one has ended up really saying we need a completely different kind of party [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=171.5s)]
*  We need to report the news differently we need what does anybody think they need to do differently six months on I don't think you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=175.02s)]
*  Stand up for democracy with values of kind of closeness [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=182.1s)]
*  And I think the value of curiosity [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=185.9s)]
*  Openness is the only way to beat whatever Donald Trump is what Democrats need to be curious about is how they lost to people making [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  Less than fifty thousand dollars to Donald Trump. I mean they can send they say Donald Trump's evil. He's a racist [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=194.88s)]
*  He's this he's that he's other the focus now if you're a Democrat [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=200.78s)]
*  I'm just talking to somebody that's run an election or two. It's not what's behind me [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=204.76s)]
*  It's what's in front of me Donald Trump is not going to be running again in 2028 [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=209.64s)]
*  And so the Democratic Party can keep looking backwards, but they don't need to look to Donald Trump [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=213.68s)]
*  They need to look to the people who voted for Donald Trump and why they lost to Donald Trump [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=220.4s)]
*  And as an it says I see no evidence that they're doing that like I we've had people on this show [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=224.92s)]
*  What are the working Americans making less than fifty thousand dollars vote for Donald Trump? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=231.2s)]
*  They can't answer the question Democrats can't answer that question. By the way, why did people of color? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=235.68s)]
*  Drift towards him after four years of experiencing him as president, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=242.16s)]
*  if these things don't provoke reckoning and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=246.4s)]
*  Real rethinking we don't have one new leader, right? It's remarkable [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=249.28s)]
*  What's remarkable and what needs a reckoning is for Democrats for actually more than just the Democrats more than just a political party is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=254.88s)]
*  How is it that one specific political party the Republican Party seems? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=263.04s)]
*  gravitated towards [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=269.4s)]
*  Captured by and clings to one individual Donald J. Trump. How did he do this? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=270.88s)]
*  How did he transform? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=278.52s)]
*  Politics in America and become so all-consuming to so many people including Democrats including people making [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=280.56s)]
*  $50,000 a year or less including laborers firefighters police officers [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=288.52s)]
*  What is it about him? You have to look at your enemy in order to defeat an enemy [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  You have to know who you're fighting. It seems to me and a lot of other people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=298.28s)]
*  I think that the Democrats simply have never sat down and defying who he is and how to grow [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=302.2s)]
*  First you have to know who you are and the Democrats don't know who they are [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=308.44s)]
*  Right, and secondly you have to know who your opponent is and and again how to fight them again [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=311.96s)]
*  And again, they're not running against Donald Trump in 2028 [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=317.64s)]
*  Maybe they're running against him a little bit in 2026, but they're running against him in 2028, right? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=321.32s)]
*  So but don't they need to figure out who they are first and they have to know what battlefield they're on [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=327.08s)]
*  I think the answer to your question one of them is that Donald Trump understands [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=332.32s)]
*  Maybe uniquely that politics in this day and age is played on a level of emotion [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  And psychology and attention as much as it is on policy [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  And it's incredible to me how few people [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=346.92s)]
*  Understand that on the other side how few people understand the importance of being a cultural having a cultural figure [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  A cultural presence that helps people sort through Donald Trump for all of his profound [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=357.8s)]
*  Personal and and cerebral limitations is a culture maker and is a player in the culture and is participating [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  In the meaning-making process that voters are engaged in every day. Why did this happen? Why did that happen? Why are eggs expensive? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=370.68s)]
*  Why are my kids learning this in school? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=376.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is running almost unopposed in the cultural meaning-making process [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=378.12s)]
*  In this country and the democratic party and we can talk about other institutions the democratic party above all has abdicated any role [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=383.08s)]
*  In participating in the cultural process instead it stands at the end of the pipeline saying please five dollars and please vote [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=390.2s)]
*  And is ignoring 90 of where politics happens [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=396.84s)]
*  Which is where people figure out the world figure out what they think make sense of things and form preferences and john heilman [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=399.72s)]
*  certainly democrats have struggled to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=406.36s)]
*  Handle donald trump, but they've even been worse at sort of identifying themselves and pitching a message going forward a few exceptions [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=409.0s)]
*  We know we see the crowds that bernie sanders and aoc have drawn [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=415.88s)]
*  But as you speak to members of the party, you know, what are they saying here? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=419.24s)]
*  Because some of the democrats i've talked to are frustrated that even though they're still doing it [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=423.24s)]
*  There's a party right now is still consumed with the past and not looking for the future and a new message [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=428.04s)]
*  Right well [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=435.32s)]
*  john, I think that the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=437.48s)]
*  The there's two a couple important things to say one is to honor the end of anan's last point [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=439.72s)]
*  It is it's it is true and also not true that democrats and I say when I say democrats here [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=444.52s)]
*  I don't mean the party but liberals [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=450.92s)]
*  The left the left of center, whatever aren't part of the cultural conversation [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=454.12s)]
*  In fact, there are a couple different cultural conversations going on in america at the same time [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=458.2s)]
*  And one of the reasons why the cultural conversation on the right has become [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=462.44s)]
*  Has gotten so much traction is because of the fact that that the left their democrats whatever you want to call them [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=466.44s)]
*  Has been seen as dominating the mainstream commonator cultural conversation for so long who controls hollywood who controls the media [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=472.35999999999996s)]
*  That's you have to be kind of nuts to think that the mainstream media and the mainstream entertainment establishment in america isn't largely left of center [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=479.88s)]
*  What's happening is there's these two different conversations and what has happened is the conversation this gets your point john is that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  Is that right now? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=493.79999999999995s)]
*  uh somehow the democratic party [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=495.32s)]
*  finds itself in a place where [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=498.12s)]
*  Uh the it is it is no longer the home of working americans largely [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=500.2s)]
*  And if bobby kennedy the coalition of bobby kennedy was trying to put together in 1968 before he was killed [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=505.48s)]
*  That coalition of working class whites working class latinos working class african americans that coalition has been put together [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=511.4s)]
*  More effectively by donald trump than by anybody in the democratic party. That's a huge problem [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=518.76s)]
*  And to joe's point that conversation of how to solve how to get [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=524.2s)]
*  How to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=529.0s)]
*  Write that wrong. I mean, I think there's no democrat in the country who would say it's messed up [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=530.44s)]
*  That we are no longer the party of the of working people and that bobby kennedy's coalition is being put together by donald trump [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=535.6400000000001s)]
*  More than by any of our leaders. How do we fix that problem? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=542.2s)]
*  What does the democratic party have to do to become? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  What it in many respects what it was when at its most effective over the course of the last 40 50 years [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=548.44s)]
*  That conversation is happening at the most superficial level at the most performative level you hear democrats all across the spectrum saying [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=553.9599999999999s)]
*  We need to change we need root and branch reform. We need to moderate. We don't need litmus tests anymore [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=561.8s)]
*  We have alice slockett who I really like and respect but who is out there saying well, we can't be woken weak anymore [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=567.64s)]
*  No one is talking about what actually that means [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  And uh, there's a there's a a sub stack writer named matthew iglesias who called that performative moderation [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=577.64s)]
*  A lot of what the party is doing right now is purely performative. No one is talking about okay [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  What's the position? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=589.4s)]
*  That you want to take that's outside the mainstream of democratic thinking that is going to mean that you're not woke and weak [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  If that is what you think [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=597.9599999999999s)]
*  What's the thing if you're on the left that if you say like aoc does there should be no litmus tests anymore [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=599.4s)]
*  What's okay, what's a liberal litmus test congresswoman that you'd like to violate now in the spirit of making the party different than what it has been [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=605.0s)]
*  And what it has been perceived to be over these last couple cycles [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=613.4799999999999s)]
*  Everyone is talking at the most superficial level and not at the deep level that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  Like the democratic leadership council did back at the end of the 1980s and early 90s when the party went through this same problem [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=621.88s)]
*  And and and we and they had to have the same kind of reform that was real reform [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=628.92s)]
*  This is right now so far superficial talk about reform and not real reform [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=632.84s)]
*  Well, and and you you just look inside of congress on and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=637.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody watches the show. We confuse my politics with aoc's politics [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=641.3199999999999s)]
*  Just you've never been confused with nobody's been nobody's no one's confused me with with aoc's politics [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=647.56s)]
*  And yet I sit here [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=654.84s)]
*  Uh fairly conservative independent [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=657.56s)]
*  Absolutely flummoxed by a democratic party that refuses to let her in leadership [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=661.62s)]
*  like proving that the house is not a meritocracy never was a meritocracy the fact that they're afraid [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  To have the person who who is considered in polls to be the voice and the face of the democratic party right now [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=677.56s)]
*  Now [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=685.48s)]
*  Moderates take a deep breath. Everything shakes out you're gonna be okay [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=686.6800000000001s)]
*  But she she does a better job getting out there and explaining the inequities that drive working americans [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=692.04s)]
*  To republicans she also to her credit [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=701.8000000000001s)]
*  She went she talked to people who voted for donald trump and voted for her [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=705.32s)]
*  And didn't go what's wrong with your head. She's like tell me can we need to do that [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=710.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=713.32s)]
*  And by the way, she's under 80. I don't know if you knew that or not. She's under 80. So you're telling me [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=714.52s)]
*  That the democratic party [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=721.0s)]
*  Does not have a place [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=723.4s)]
*  For her in leadership. Do you know how insane that is? It is categorically insane [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=725.96s)]
*  It is actually the litmus test that the democrats do have which is if you are exciting and thrilling and galvanizing to people [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=732.84s)]
*  Please stay away [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=739.24s)]
*  From any important role in our party no job here no job here [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=740.92s)]
*  She doesn't have reading glasses yet as far as I know and that really really disqualifies her [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=745.0s)]
*  And and she is capturing as you say not just progressives anymore. There's also an evolution of the story from 2018 [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=751.0799999999999s)]
*  It's seven years later. She's actually speaking to all kinds of people at those fighting oligarchy rallies [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=757.4799999999999s)]
*  Eight to ten percent of people are republicans right showing up, right? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=763.16s)]
*  It's so interesting and if you at the center of these power systems and institutions are the last to know what people are feeling [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  This republic is in even more danger than we thought [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=774.44s)]
*  By the way john, go mayor people have a drinking game and they drink every time we say steve bannon's name gets her shot glass ready [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=777.6400000000001s)]
*  What is it cause? Yeah, but vodka I guess. All right. I don't know. Let's go but whatever it is this morning [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=783.0s)]
*  steve bannon [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=789.96s)]
*  What's this what does he say about aoc which just to explain again the people there were people who voted for bernie sanderson in [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=791.48s)]
*  primary that in 16 that voted for donald trump [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=797.48s)]
*  You you hear [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=800.68s)]
*  You hear steve bannon and some ag people talking about aoc and what do they say bannon says of aoc that she's first of all [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=802.12s)]
*  She's a very talented political athlete that her message this populist message resonates [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=807.72s)]
*  And that she shares some overlap frankly with some of the things that he and the maga's [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=812.52s)]
*  You know crowd believe in and that also that he's afraid of her as as the future of democratic party that she is he in his estimation [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=816.12s)]
*  Someone who could win and win big down the road [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQRgiJDHrDU&t=822.92s)]
