# ‘I bet Biden would never do this’: Atlantic editor says Trump has ‘odd’ fixation with predecessor
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08)
*  Joining the conversation we have editor-in-chief at the Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg and Joe we're chatting here about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=0.0s)]
*  His visit his recent visit interview [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Work with President Trump, and it's just it's fascinating [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=11.78s)]
*  Mr.. Sunshine goes to the Oval Office [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=16.32s)]
*  name by the way for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  They may future autobiography [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=22.84s)]
*  Honestly [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=24.84s)]
*  So Jeffrey I'm curious about [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=34.04s)]
*  your takeaways [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=38.0s)]
*  Substantively, but also just sort of what you read sitting across the table from [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=39.84s)]
*  President Trump and of course I asked this question if people are going. What do you what did he read? This is what? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=46.6s)]
*  You do and what reporters do and what we do? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  When we're sitting across the table from any world leader or any politician or any diplomat. I'm curious [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=56.68s)]
*  What what were your what your major takeaways from your visit inside the President Trump's office? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=62.76s)]
*  my very first observation [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=70.68s)]
*  And this this this happened repeatedly in the interview we walk in and the first thing he says apart from like there's kind of like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=73.16s)]
*  This knowing like oh my god. You're here. I'm here. How fun is this sort of thing? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  The first thing I the first thing he said was I bet Joe Biden would never do this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  And then about six or eight times during the interview he refers to Joe Biden Joe Biden doesn't do this Joe Biden is dumb [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=91.12s)]
*  Joe Biden was sleepy. Whatever. It's like [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=98.94s)]
*  It's it's a truly odd [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=103.0s)]
*  Like he's gone. It's like you're the president [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  It's it's just this this crutch and you see it in all its features that that was that was noticeable [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=108.78s)]
*  You know, can I ask you about that Jeffrey? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=114.74s)]
*  Yeah, can I ask you about that because because one thing that we have said before about Donald Trump going all the way back to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=117.3s)]
*  2016 is despite his antagonism with the press [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=123.98s)]
*  He actually would get out in front of the press more in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=127.78s)]
*  2016 and again and then today for yeah than his opponents and then today [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=132.74s)]
*  So, so let me ask you would Joe Biden know have done that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah for people they're going [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  Comparing him to Joe Biden [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=154.78s)]
*  I'm just saying that is if you talk to the press corps if you talk to others [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  their biggest complaint through Joe Biden's four years in the White House is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=162.1s)]
*  He did not grant the access for instance that Donald Trump granted to you the Atlantic to us [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  To the New York Times or the Washington Post to everybody knowing this is actually it's an important point [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=172.8s)]
*  Yes, Joe Biden didn't see us in that context at all. And that was too bad [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=178.4s)]
*  He I don't think the White House staff much of the White House staff and certainly the sort of MAGA faithful [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=183.72s)]
*  Really thought it was super idea to bring us in but he doesn't care. He's not scared Donald Trump [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=192.04s)]
*  He he understands that it's all [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=198.96s)]
*  Fake in a kind of way that I'm gonna curse them out on social, but we're just gonna get together [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=202.48s)]
*  I mean, first of all, he wants here's the thing that that people who study this know [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  He wants the approval of the mainstream media when he doesn't get the approval of the mainstream media [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=213.72s)]
*  He lashes out at the mainstream media. This is not a secret. You just just you could watch this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=219.64s)]
*  So so it's not surprising that we were in it's not surprising that he turned on the full charm and the full charisma [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=225.48s)]
*  It wasn't a confrontational. I asked and my colleagues Ashley Parker and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=232.68s)]
*  Michael Shearer asked hard questions confrontational questions and he handled them in a very low-key [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=238.24s)]
*  Non-defensive way you could see it in the transcript that we posted [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=245.12s)]
*  So it was fascinating. I mean the most the thing that I'll take away from that more than anything was when I asked him [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  Like, you know you've so I said to him you've won you're the most successful person in America. You've won [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm even doing the hands [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=264.04s)]
*  The success accordion [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=271.6s)]
*  You're the most successful person in America [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=274.84s)]
*  Like what you know [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=277.48s)]
*  You've won the presidency twice and he goes three times and I'm like [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=279.48s)]
*  Oh, and I said that's that's my point like you didn't win three times, but it's okay [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=283.16s)]
*  Like can we just go on from that now? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=288.92s)]
*  And not talk about vengeance and revenge and retribution and he's like and lies [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=293.8s)]
*  And this is what he said. He said he said look there's two kinds of people here [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=299.68s)]
*  You know, there's one to think I should just go forward and do policy or whatever and believe it or not [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=303.76s)]
*  I'm in that category and I said, I don't really believe it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  And then he and then he said and there's a bunch of people here in the White House though [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=311.68s)]
*  Who think that we can't let this kind of campaign against me go unanswered? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=317.44s)]
*  And so he's like pinning all of the retribution activities which are manifold on his staff [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=322.68s)]
*  I thought that was a kind of an odd [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=329.88s)]
*  Situation and I just felt like it was like this this weird deflection [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=332.68s)]
*  It's like we know that you're the retribution president and the reason we know that is because you said [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=337.24s)]
*  You were going to be the retribution [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=341.68s)]
*  Retribution, right? Yeah, so there's so much in here. We talk about tariffs [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=343.84s)]
*  We can talk about Ukraine talk about immigration [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=347.04s)]
*  But I am curious what you said at the top which there was a knowing look from the president [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=349.98s)]
*  But isn't this funny to two of us here? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, what did he say about what's become known as signal gate where you invite were invited? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=356.2s)]
*  Famously into that signal chat where there were attack plans classified plans placed in there. What did he say about that? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=361.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he had sort of a [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=367.62s)]
*  Ultimately when we when we when we got him to actually address the substance of the issue [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=370.38s)]
*  He had a kind of almost like a cat skills routine about I said, what's the lesson? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=374.38s)]
*  Like what's the operational security lesson of signal gate and he goes maybe don't use signal, you know, like kind of like [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=378.74s)]
*  pretty simple, but what was interesting was his I his [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=385.82s)]
*  Notion of signal gate is different. The importance of it is different to him than it is. Let's say me or us [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=390.34s)]
*  He thought that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=397.14s)]
*  We were successful with signal gate not because we exposed [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=399.14s)]
*  Pretty serious national security lapse on the part of his officials, but because we got a lot of attention [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=403.14s)]
*  You know and attention is the the metric so he was very much focused on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=408.14s)]
*  Well, you got a lot of attention for that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=412.98s)]
*  so therefore you succeeded and therefore I have to contend with this in some way because [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=414.78s)]
*  You know signal gate dominated the news cycle for 12 hours or 24 hours or something like that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=419.5s)]
*  But he doesn't take it seriously. I got the sense for what it's worth [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=425.02s)]
*  I got the sense that his support for Pete Hegseth is not a forever kind of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=429.82s)]
*  support [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=434.94s)]
*  You know, he was like he's gonna work it out. It's gonna be fine. I had a talk with him [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=436.42s)]
*  It was a positive talk. He was very much in rhetorical control [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=440.42s)]
*  When he was talking about Pete Hegseth in a way that he was like reminding himself [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=443.9s)]
*  Don't throw the guy under the bus [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=447.62s)]
*  Until I have to throw the guy under the bus, but you know if you're Pete Hegseth you're sitting there going I [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=450.22s)]
*  Don't know this this I got it. He has a black mark on him, you know right now [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=455.86s)]
*  He's got like he's like two strikes or something like that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=459.94s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=464.22s)]
*  Jeffrey that's that's what's so fascinating about these interviews and again for people saying well [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=465.74s)]
*  Why do reporters go in and talk to Donald Trump the question answers itself, but [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=470.86s)]
*  You read between the lines [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=476.6s)]
*  You read him [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=478.64000000000004s)]
*  You kind of read the people in the room and see how they're responding [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=480.6s)]
*  And I thought one of the one of the real tells in here [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=484.48s)]
*  Or just what you're keying in on and something that we noticed when we sat with him [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  The fact he did not appreciate being blindsided during the transition about Pete Hegseth's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  Problems that he wasn't told about and then in your interview the fact that it was not a wholehearted [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  You know like you said he was rhetorically in control, but it was not a wholehearted [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  Endorsement of Pete Hegseth. He said I think he's gonna get it together [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=512.84s)]
*  I had a talk with him a positive talk, but I had a talk with him [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=515.96s)]
*  You you you certainly don't have to read through that too much [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=520.8s)]
*  To draw the conclusion that you drew Jeffy important word in that quote was the butt [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=524.48s)]
*  I had a positive talk, but I had a talk but the but means that it wasn't that positive [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=529.12s)]
*  It was like what are you but there's still a problem? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=534.48s)]
*  Well, what are you doing over there? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=536.8s)]
*  And I think like in the more serious vein inside the White House people are coming to him and saying Pete Hegseth does not [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=538.44s)]
*  Have control over the world's largest organization, you know, or second largest organization after the Chinese People's Army [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=544.64s)]
*  You know, like Pete Hegseth is not in control of this situation and you know, there's another thing [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=551.2s)]
*  He said he started talking about I hire so many people in this office. We hire 10,000 people. Sometimes we make mistakes [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=556.52s)]
*  Maybe I'm over interpreting that but it was kind of like [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=562.36s)]
*  Well when somebody has to leave it's because we have too many people to hire [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=566.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean there it is true that they hire 10,000 people in the executive office of the president [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=571.66s)]
*  It's also true that the Secretary of Defense is about the second or third most important one [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=575.96s)]
*  You arguably maybe the most important one. So you want to get that one, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  But yeah, there was definitely a kind of a feeling of like yeah, I like Pete but little separation [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so as we heard repeatedly in the cabinet meeting yesterday, it's very active first hundred days for this for this president [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=590.44s)]
*  But it seems like the defining storyline in many ways is the tariffs and the economy [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=598.14s)]
*  That's what they're most nervous about in the White House [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=601.46s)]
*  Well, here tell us what in your interview with him talk to us about how he defended or rationalized or explained the tariffs [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=603.0s)]
*  So it's it's good to and I hadn't seen him in a long time [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=610.0s)]
*  It's very good to have direct exposure to him in order to understand what truly [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=613.16s)]
*  Moves him and what you know what truly with that grips him [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=619.72s)]
*  And there's nothing except for the immigration issues like get them out [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=624.6s)]
*  Whoever them is [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=629.56s)]
*  There's nothing that he more sincerely holds on to than the idea that that tariffs are the answer to the central dilemma [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=631.48s)]
*  Of his life and what he thinks of as the central dilemma of American life that we're being ripped off, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, I've talked to we've all talked to economists to explain that it's not a ripoff when you buy a [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=646.1999999999999s)]
*  Shirt that's made in Vietnam and you give Vietnam money. They get money you get a shirt [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=654.24s)]
*  You don't feel ripped off [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=659.9599999999999s)]
*  But in in Donald Trump's universe if there's a if there's an imbalance, it means that somehow we're being ripped up [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=661.3199999999999s)]
*  He is committed to this he he did not say he was asked explicitly by Michael Shearer [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=666.68s)]
*  Is there a point at which the stock market and the bond market tell you? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=673.04s)]
*  Enough and that you pull back and he said there's no Trump put there's no you know [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=678.2399999999999s)]
*  There's no red line past which I'm I'm not willing to go that could be just you know, a [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=683.5999999999999s)]
*  Negotiating ploy but he really believes that tariffs will be our [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=691.3599999999999s)]
*  Salvation and he's committed and you know, you've heard him. He says well, maybe this quarter would bet maybe next quarter will be that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  It's amazing that you you really don't hear presidents [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=702.4s)]
*  That committed to causing to causing a recession in order to achieve an ideological goal [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=707.1199999999999s)]
*  It's sort of impressive in the sense that a man who we think doesn't really believe in anything [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=713.6999999999999s)]
*  Really does believe in this as a panacea [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=721.56s)]
*  Impressive and kind of almost a perverse way. Yeah, you look at your 401k or the stock market [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=725.76s)]
*  But but he really is gripped by the idea that this is the salvation of the United States [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=730.76s)]
*  And he doesn't really care what experts say [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=737.28s)]
*  You [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hintnsi_E08&t=754.88s)]
