# They have to grow up: Retired Army general rebukes WH over Hegseth sharing plans on Signal
**MSNBC - Morning Joe:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw)
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly used his personal phone to disclose information [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=0.0s)]
*  about U.S. military operations in Yemen in another Signal Group chat. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=6.48s)]
*  Two sources with knowledge of the matter tell NBC News 13 people were in the chat, including [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=12.66s)]
*  Hegseth's wife and brother. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=18.44s)]
*  This comes about a month after the scandal involving editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  he revealed that the Trump administration accidentally added him to a Signal Group chat [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=27.24s)]
*  about Yemen attack plans. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=33.56s)]
*  National Security Advisor Mike Waltz took responsibility for creating that message chain. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=36.1s)]
*  It was Hegseth who revealed the attack plans in that initial scandal. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=42.46s)]
*  But the New York Times report, Hegseth started this other chat and essentially shared the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=48.8s)]
*  same information in both groups, including the flight schedules for the military jets [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=53.88s)]
*  that targeted the Houthis. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  Moments ago, White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt said that President Trump stands strongly [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=61.64s)]
*  behind Hegseth, adding that this is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=67.84s)]
*  him and the monumental change Hegseth is trying to implement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=74.08s)]
*  Joining us now, retired four-star Army General Barry McCaffrey. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=79.64s)]
*  He's an NBC News and MSNBC military analyst. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=83.84s)]
*  And Joe, I'll let you take it to McCaffrey. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=88.12s)]
*  I will say that it seems that the White House is still trying to lay blame on someone else, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=90.72s)]
*  on something that a person in the administration very clearly did. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=98.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, and of course, the Pentagon is interested and people have dedicated their [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=103.72s)]
*  entire adult lives to working in the military are interested first and foremost, not on [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  people that go in and out of there as secretaries of defense, but on protecting and defending [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  this nation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=124.64s)]
*  They took an oath to uphold, to do everything they could to protect and defend the Constitution [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=125.64s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=131.68s)]
*  So, General, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=132.68s)]
*  We have once again another commercial app use for that where the SECDEF first of all [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=136.64s)]
*  announces the beginning of operations, secondly, announces when F-18s are being launched to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=144.64s)]
*  go into hostile territory and other details. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=153.84s)]
*  And he does it with civilians in the chat and others that are absolutely not on the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=158.88s)]
*  need to know list for these military operations. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=164.12s)]
*  I'm curious, building on all of your years of experiences of taking troops, young men [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=167.48s)]
*  and women, Americans into combat, tell me your thoughts on once again us finding out [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  that a commercial app is being used to transmit the most sensitive information that we have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=183.88s)]
*  about warfare. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=189.44s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, first of all, it's not just an unauthorized signal chat, commercially [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=190.84s)]
*  encrypted device. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=198.32s)]
*  It was also on his personal phone. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=199.32s)]
*  And he should assume he has been told all of the cabinet officers when they come into [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=202.32s)]
*  office from the time the president won the election would have been targeted by Chinese, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=207.56s)]
*  Russians, North Koreans, Iranians. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=213.52s)]
*  He should assume that they're capable of breaking that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=216.54s)]
*  And what he was divulging was pending military operations. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=220.16s)]
*  So we've got Navy carrier pilots launching into combat operations where the Hussies do [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=224.96s)]
*  have surface-to-air missiles, where the carrier itself is vulnerable during that launch sequence. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  And he's putting it all at risk. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  My own take on it, I think he was just in a sort of a juvenile way boasting, look at [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=239.76s)]
*  the cool secrets I've got. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=245.96s)]
*  And I think you're going to find out that he's been using this all along as a way to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=248.7s)]
*  evade the Official Documents Act, where you have to preserve communication. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=253.1s)]
*  So it's hard to understand what he was the arrogance, the vulnerability that he projected. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=260.09999999999997s)]
*  It is hard to understand. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=270.53999999999996s)]
*  It's even for civilians such as myself, why he would do this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  And General, I just want you to underline, because even as a member of the House Armed [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=277.02s)]
*  Services Committee, we would get sensitive information. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=282.62s)]
*  The thought that we would share it with civilians or share it with people outside of that committee, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=287.34s)]
*  if it was classified information, is just astounding. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=295.94s)]
*  Please try to put this into perspective on what an extraordinary, not only breach this [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=301.41999999999996s)]
*  but how extraordinarily reckless it would be for someone in your position or the Secretary [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=306.42s)]
*  of Defense that you served under to do similar things. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=314.82s)]
*  Well, some of the Secretary of Defense I served, like Dr. Bill Perry, are the opposite end [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=318.54s)]
*  of the spectrum. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=326.26s)]
*  What we've got here is a sense of arrogance and unaccountability, ignorance of the rules, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=327.26s)]
*  a sense of disbelief that it's possible for his personal phone to be monitored by foreign [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=334.74s)]
*  intelligence agencies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=341.9s)]
*  That's all well and good, but it wasn't just politically sensitive things he was revealing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=344.18s)]
*  It was information that could put at risk the lives of Navy combat pilots. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=350.06s)]
*  So again, there's just no sense of it all. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=355.5s)]
*  I think we're going to find out that routinely this cabinet group has been sharing sensitive [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=358.46000000000004s)]
*  information on an unauthorized link. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=366.14s)]
*  They've got to grow up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  They've got to understand their responsibilities to protect U.S. national security interests. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  We should note the New York Times in its reporting suggested that the Secretary of Defense was [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=377.98s)]
*  warned by staffers to not use Signal for this sort of purposes, but yet he did anyway. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=381.3s)]
*  So General, the White House press secretary made an appearance this morning on another [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=386.74s)]
*  network saying that the Secretary of Defense still had the full support of the White House. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=390.38s)]
*  Hegseth himself just briefly gaggled with reporters and said that he spoke to the president [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=395.66s)]
*  and that he was good to go and said that he blamed this whole story on disgruntled staffers [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=400.3s)]
*  and the fake news. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=406.26s)]
*  We know that some of his senior staff just quit in recent days. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=408.16s)]
*  So talk to us about that chaos, but more than that, what message would it send? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=412.62s)]
*  If Secretary of Defense continues to keep his job, what message does that send to those [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=416.6s)]
*  men and women in uniform who are putting their lives on the line each and every day under [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=421.32000000000005s)]
*  his command? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=425.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, you know, this secretary was a major in combat operations in Afghanistan. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=426.76000000000005s)]
*  You know, you just got to go back in your own mind. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=431.48s)]
*  Had he sent his wife back in the United States and brother and personal lawyers classified [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=434.66s)]
*  a pending helicopter assault in Afghanistan, he would have been canned. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=441.12s)]
*  And of course, it's immensely more sensitive and serious, the highest level of our government. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=446.88s)]
*  So I think the whole crew of them needs to sit down and understand they've got to act [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=453.68s)]
*  like adults. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=458.64s)]
*  They've got to obey the rules that they are vulnerable to foreign intelligence collection. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=459.64s)]
*  But this is an arrogant group of people that don't think the rules apply to them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=466.6s)]
*  General, can you spell out the foreign intelligence collection a little bit more there? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=471.0s)]
*  How how possible would it be for Russia or China or somebody acting independently who [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  would then on sell the information to somebody else to hack into signal on a private telephone [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=482.68s)]
*  like this? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=489.24s)]
*  We're always told the signal is a an encrypted service that is safe. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=490.24s)]
*  Is it totally immune from being hacked? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=494.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, your personal phone is not safe in any way, despite the commercial [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=497.44s)]
*  encryption of the signal transmission, nor intermediate servers necessarily safe. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=504.32s)]
*  But I would just suggest to you that I'd be astonished if the Brits, the U.S., the Iranians, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  the Chinese, the Russians, all of them haven't also busted the signal encryption. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=517.48s)]
*  If foreign leaders are using it, then our NSA would try and bust it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=522.84s)]
*  We won't know. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=528.1600000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't hopefully ever respond to that kind of a question. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=529.1600000000001s)]
*  But by the way, you know, when it comes to intelligence collection on the U.S. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=532.2800000000001s)]
*  government, our allies now undoubtedly have us as one of their primary collection targets. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=537.1600000000001s)]
*  The Danes will want to know if we're about to mount a military operation against Greenland, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=543.96s)]
*  just as an example. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=549.72s)]
*  So these are not secure systems. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  We put a multi-billion dollar global secure communication system in place, CIPRNET, for [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=553.28s)]
*  our officials to use. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=561.56s)]
*  These people decided it didn't apply to them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=563.4s)]
*  Again, I think the real reason they do that is that it could be a bro channel on signal [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  and stay out of the Official Records Act. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=573.7199999999999s)]
*  I think that's what they were doing it for. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=578.72s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=579.72s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=580.72s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M4bN7HMFjw&t=581.72s)]
