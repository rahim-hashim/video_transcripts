# Israel and Hezbollah Trade Fire, and Polls Find Trump Ahead in Sun Belt States
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=4.96s)]
*  Today's Monday, September 23rd. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=6.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=8.56s)]
*  About an hour ago, following indications that Hezbollah was preparing to fire towards Israeli [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=14.56s)]
*  territory, we began striking terrorist targets throughout Lebanon. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=21.6s)]
*  In the Middle East this morning, the Israeli military's chief spokesman warned residents [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=27.16s)]
*  of southern Lebanon, who live near Hezbollah strongholds, to evacuate ahead of a series [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=31.36s)]
*  of Israeli airstrikes. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=36.08s)]
*  In the first of several attacks, dozens of Israeli warplanes hit more than 150 targets, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  according to the Israeli military. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=43.72s)]
*  The spokesman said the military was currently focusing on a, quote, aerial campaign only. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=45.72s)]
*  Lebanon's state-run news agency reported extensive damage across a number of towns. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=51.72s)]
*  An early report from the health ministry said at least 50 people had been killed and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=56.72s)]
*  over 300 were injured. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=61.12s)]
*  The strikes came after a week of escalation between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=63.36s)]
*  Yesterday, Hezbollah, which has been firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas, launched [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=67.64s)]
*  more than 100 rockets, cruise missiles, and drones towards Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=72.6s)]
*  On Friday, an Israeli airstrike near the Lebanese capital killed several senior Hezbollah commanders. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  And an earlier widespread attack on pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah injured [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=83.2s)]
*  hundreds if not thousands of rank-and-file members. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=88.04s)]
*  The United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon warned over the weekend that the region [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=91.64s)]
*  is on the brink of an imminent catastrophe and that there is, quote, no military solution [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=95.98s)]
*  that will make either side safer. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=101.04s)]
*  Live coverage of the conflict is on the New York Times app or at nytimes.com. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=104.12s)]
*  New polling from the Times and Siena College zooms in on three battleground states that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=113.2s)]
*  have been at the center of the race in recent weeks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=120.12s)]
*  Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have been campaigning heavily in Arizona, Georgia, and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=123.0s)]
*  North Carolina. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=127.64s)]
*  And the polls show that Trump has the lead. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=129.08s)]
*  He's up three points in North Carolina, four in Georgia, and up five points in Arizona. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=131.6s)]
*  Overall, likely voters in the so-called Sun Belt states say that Trump improved their [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=137.24s)]
*  lives when he was president, and they're worried that Harris would not if she gets [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=142.16s)]
*  elected. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=146.0s)]
*  The poll also found that about 15 percent of voters in those three states are undecided. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=147.16s)]
*  This is a group where when we pulled them a month ago, they leaned slightly towards [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=152.42s)]
*  Harris. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=155.32s)]
*  Now they lean a little bit towards Trump. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=156.32s)]
*  Ruth Igelnick conducts and analyzes polls for the Times. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=158.88s)]
*  We asked these undecided swing voters specifically what were their concerns about Trump and Harris. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=162.24s)]
*  For Harris, some mentioned her economic policies, but honestly, the biggest concern that undecided [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=169.04s)]
*  and persuadable voters had about either of them were sort of personality-based. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=174.6s)]
*  They were concerned about the way that Trump talks and the things that he says. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=179.16s)]
*  And with Harris, there were a lot of concerns raised among undecided voters about her trustworthiness [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=183.4s)]
*  and honesty, and then some about sort of her personality and ability to handle the job. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=189.16s)]
*  Beyond the Sun Belt, the Times' national polling average shows Harris still in the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=196.36s)]
*  lead with 50 percent to Donald Trump's 47 percent. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the North Carolina governor's race, the fallout continues after a report [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=210.0s)]
*  revealed disturbing comments made by the Republican nominee there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=215.08s)]
*  The Times has learned that eight members of Mark Robinson's campaign, most of his senior [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  staff, have resigned, including his campaign manager and finance director. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=223.64s)]
*  Last week, CNN published dozens of remarks that Robinson had made in the comments section [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=228.6s)]
*  of a porn site about a decade ago, including calling himself a quote, Black Nazi, saying [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  he supported slavery and that he spied on women in public gym showers as a teenager. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=239.16s)]
*  Robinson, who is currently North Carolina's lieutenant governor, has denied that he wrote [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=244.72s)]
*  the posts. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  In a statement released after his staff resigned, he said his campaign was in a quote, strong [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=250.16s)]
*  position to make our case to the voters and win. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=254.4s)]
*  Recent polls show him as much as 13 points behind his Democratic opponent, Josh Stein, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=257.84s)]
*  the state's attorney general. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=262.6s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson and congressional leaders have announced a spending deal that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=270.44s)]
*  would fund the government through December 20th in order to avoid a government shutdown [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=274.52s)]
*  just weeks before the election. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=278.96s)]
*  Leaders from both parties unveiled the deal yesterday, and Johnson said he would put it [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=281.4s)]
*  to a vote later this week. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=285.08s)]
*  To make the spending deal happen, Johnson had to drop a demand he'd been personally [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=287.32s)]
*  committed to, requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, a provision pushed by [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump and supported by the hard right wing of the Republican Party. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=296.76s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson told his colleagues in a letter on Sunday that he took the deal, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=300.64s)]
*  even though it wasn't what he wanted or the Republican conservatives wanted, because it [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=304.52s)]
*  would be, quote, political malpractice to pitch Congress into a shutdown right ahead [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=308.36s)]
*  of a November election. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=314.16s)]
*  Times congressional reporter Karin Demirjian has been covering the negotiations. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  Control of the House is going to be coming down to the wire, so will control of the Senate [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=320.32s)]
*  and the presidency. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=323.92s)]
*  And Johnson basically told his colleagues it would be a bad idea to be bickering about [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=325.5s)]
*  these budget details and they'll live to fight another day. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=329.16s)]
*  That's probably not going to sit well with the right or Trump, and we will see how many [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  Republicans flee from this deal when it hits the floor this week. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=336.16s)]
*  Johnson may likely have to turn to Democrats to carry this bill across the finish line. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  And he's been criticized by his rank and file for making these deals with Democrats necessary [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  as they are to avoid shutdowns and keep the federal dollars flowing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=349.88000000000005s)]
*  For the most part, the spending deal keeps the government funded at its current levels, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=354.68s)]
*  with one notable exception. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=358.72s)]
*  The bill would give the Secret Service an additional $231 million. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=360.44000000000005s)]
*  The agency has been short-staffed for years and has been under intense scrutiny after [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=365.4s)]
*  Donald Trump was shot in July and after an apparent assassination attempt on Trump was [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=369.44s)]
*  foiled earlier this month. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  And finally, the Chicago White Sox are on their way to reaching a new low. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=385.2s)]
*  That ball is gone! [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=390.28s)]
*  Home run, Fernando! [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=392.56s)]
*  Last night, they put on a dismal performance against the San Diego Padres, officially putting [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=394.68s)]
*  them on track to become the all-time worst team in modern baseball history. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  Sunday's loss means the White Sox are now tied for most losses by a modern-day major [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  league team in a single season at 120 losses. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  You can't go lower than this son! [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=415.8s)]
*  At a popular Sox bar on Chicago's South Side, loyal fans watched as their team made history [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=419.4s)]
*  for all the wrong reasons. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's obviously super depressing to watch a team every night where you think, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  they're probably going to lose this game. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=430.08s)]
*  Among other reasons for the team's long string of losses, people close to the White Sox tell [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=431.64s)]
*  the Times that it hasn't integrated data and analytics into its operations the way other [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  teams have. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=441.03999999999996s)]
*  The Sox now join the 1962 New York Mets in holding the losing record, but there are still [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=442.52s)]
*  six regular season games to go, plenty of chances for Sox fans to celebrate in their [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=447.76s)]
*  own way. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=452.84s)]
*  We're right there! [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=453.84s)]
*  You're right there! [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=454.84s)]
*  You might as well be the number one. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=455.84s)]
*  You're going to be the best! [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=456.84s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to be like runner-up on the worst bet team. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=457.84s)]
*  You want to be the best worst bet team. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=459.84s)]
*  Best worst of it, yes. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=461.84s)]
*  This is like our trophy! [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=462.84s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=467.84s)]
*  Today on The Daily, How Telegram became one of the most popular messaging apps in the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=468.84s)]
*  world and a forum for criminals and terrorists. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=473.32s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=477.04s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson in for Tracy Monfort. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=481.12s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqVJEDZx9jc&t=483.92s)]
