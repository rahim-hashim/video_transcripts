# Stocks Plunge Worldwide, and Trump Faces Mass Protests
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Monday, April 7th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=8.0s)]
*  Did you purchase your car faster because you knew that tariffs were coming? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=14.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=18.0s)]
*  I could have just imagined how much more expensive it would be. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=19.0s)]
*  It's going to hit food prices, it's going to hit gas prices, it's going to hit… [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=22.0s)]
*  President Trump's new tariffs set off alarm bells across the global economy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=26.0s)]
*  The Times talked with shoppers this weekend at grocery stores, car dealerships and malls, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=30.0s)]
*  some of whom were scrambling to stock up. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=36.0s)]
*  What kinds of purchases are you prioritizing? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=38.0s)]
*  Electronics, anything like that. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=41.0s)]
*  Definitely trying to buy that up while I can while it's so affordable. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=43.0s)]
*  The new 10% baseline tariff applies to all imported goods, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=46.0s)]
*  and goods from some countries will get hit with up to a 40% surcharge or more. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=51.0s)]
*  That could mean higher prices for consumers as soon as this month, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=56.0s)]
*  and it's spurred a lot of confusion and concern about whether to buy that new refrigerator or iPhone or even printer paper. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=60.0s)]
*  The panic is enough to make me want to buy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah. Did you start today? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=69.0s)]
*  I did. I did actually start today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=71.0s)]
*  The uncertainty continues to shake the stock market too. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=74.0s)]
*  This morning, the financial markets in Asia and Europe fell sharply again [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=77.0s)]
*  after plunging last week following Trump's announcement. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=81.0s)]
*  The U.S. markets had lost more than $5 trillion in value by the end of Friday. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=84.0s)]
*  President Trump, however, has dismissed the turmoil. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=89.0s)]
*  I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=92.0s)]
*  Speaking on Air Force One last night, he said the tariffs will stay in place [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=97.0s)]
*  until the trade deficits that the U.S. has with China, the European Union and other countries disappear, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=102.0s)]
*  essentially until the rest of the world buys as much from the U.S. as the U.S. buys from them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=108.0s)]
*  And eventually it's going to straighten out and our country will be solid and strong again. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=114.0s)]
*  Despite Trump's insistence that the tariffs will stay in place, many countries are hoping they can negotiate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=119.0s)]
*  The White House said more than 50 countries have been in touch to try and strike a deal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=125.0s)]
*  A federal judge has given the Trump administration a deadline of midnight tonight [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=133.0s)]
*  to bring back a man it mistakenly deported to a prison in El Salvador. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=138.0s)]
*  The man had permission to be in the U.S. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=142.0s)]
*  And in an order yesterday, the judge said that the government had no right to arrest him or send him to the prison, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=145.0s)]
*  where he's been held since mid-March. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=151.0s)]
*  She wrote that the case, quote, shocks the conscience. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=153.0s)]
*  The Justice Department, however, has said it can't bring him back. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=156.0s)]
*  It's claimed there's nothing it can do since he's no longer in U.S. custody. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=160.0s)]
*  The department also took aim at one of its own lawyers, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=164.0s)]
*  who said he would try to convince the administration to return the man. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=168.0s)]
*  The lawyer, who had admitted last week that the deportation was a mistake, was placed on indefinite leave. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=171.0s)]
*  In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi told the Times that the lawyer had failed to, quote, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=178.0s)]
*  zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=184.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=195.0s)]
*  around the country this weekend, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest President Trump, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=199.0s)]
*  his administration, and a range of its policies, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=205.0s)]
*  from tariffs to immigration crackdowns to cuts at government agencies. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=208.0s)]
*  Our research! [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=214.0s)]
*  The protests were organized by a coalition of progressive groups who planned them in all 50 states. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=216.0s)]
*  In Manhattan, the protests stretched for 20 city blocks, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=222.0s)]
*  and in Atlanta, police estimated some 20,000 people showed up to march. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=226.0s)]
*  There were also protests in smaller places, including Leesburg, Tennessee, St. Augustine, Florida, and Ketchum, Idaho. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=231.0s)]
*  In Syria, one of the most horrifying aspects of the country's civil war was the use of chemical weapons. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=244.0s)]
*  The symbol for chlorine painted on the barrel bomb used in the air attack in this… [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=255.0s)]
*  The country's former president, Bashar al-Assad, used them against rebel fighters and civilians over more than a decade of conflict. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=260.0s)]
*  First responders doused the victims with water, stripped off their clothes to wash off what they said was a chemical weapon. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=267.0s)]
*  But since Assad was suddenly thrown out of power at the end of last year, the fate of those dangerous weapons has been unclear. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=274.0s)]
*  There remain a lot of major questions about this chemical weapons program, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=281.0s)]
*  like how many weapons are left, where are they located, and what's going to happen to them under the new government. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=285.0s)]
*  My colleague Megha Rajagopalan has been reporting from Syria. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=292.0s)]
*  She says a watchdog group, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=295.0s)]
*  estimates there may be far more chemical weapons sites than the Assad regime ever disclosed, potentially more than a hundred. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=300.0s)]
*  These sites could contain weapons like mustard, sarin, or chlorine gas, some of the most toxic substances on earth. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=307.0s)]
*  And many experts, including people who were actually involved in hunting for chemical weapons in Syria in the past, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=314.0s)]
*  say that many of these weapons stockpiles could be in locations that are extremely hard to access and impossible to see on satellite images, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=322.0s)]
*  places like caves and other hidden locations. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=329.0s)]
*  And so while Syria's government has pledged to get rid of these caches of weapons, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=332.0s)]
*  it presents a major challenge for them because they first have to determine where the locations are. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=337.0s)]
*  And finally, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=342.0s)]
*  Olevichkin has it, he scores! He scores! Alex Olevichkin scores 895! [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=347.0s)]
*  Alexander Olevichkin made hockey history on Sunday, scoring his 895th career goal, becoming the NHL's all-time leading scorer. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=356.0s)]
*  There is but one! Alexander the Great, the greatest to ever do it! [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=367.0s)]
*  Olevichkin broke the record set by Wayne Gretzky more than 31 years ago. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=374.0s)]
*  The goal came in the middle of the second period and Olevichkin dove to the ice in celebration, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=379.0s)]
*  with his teammates from the Washington Capitals rushing off the bench to mob him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=384.0s)]
*  Referees paused everything so there could be a mid-game ceremony. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=389.0s)]
*  At Center Ice, Olevichkin was joined by his family and the league's commissioner, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=394.0s)]
*  as he thanked his teammates, fans, coaches, and even the goalie he just scored on. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=398.0s)]
*  Gretzky himself was there to watch his record fall. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=406.0s)]
*  I can tell you firsthand, I know how hard it is to get the 894. 895 is pretty special. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=409.0s)]
*  Gretzky said records are made to be broken, but quote, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=417.0s)]
*  I'm not sure who's going to get more goals than that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=421.0s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=427.0s)]
*  This is a threat to our constitutional fabric, to our democracy, to our civil liberties, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=430.0s)]
*  and to see Skadden be complicit to aid this attack. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=437.0s)]
*  I was so ashamed to work there. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=441.0s)]
*  A conversation with a lawyer who quit his job at one of the country's most powerful law firms [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=444.0s)]
*  after it cut a deal with the Trump administration. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=449.0s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=452.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=457.0s)]
*  you [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbG6Q9q02I&t=471.0s)]
