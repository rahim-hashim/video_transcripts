# The Dramatic House Budget Vote, and a New ‘Gold Card’ for Immigrants
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, February 26th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=7.76s)]
*  It's been quite the dramatic evening on Capitol Hill leading up to this vote. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=11.76s)]
*  Republican leaders have spent all day trying to whip or get their conference in line with [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=20.84s)]
*  the votes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=26.12s)]
*  Trump's congressional reporter Robert Jemison was at the Capitol yesterday as House Republicans [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=27.52s)]
*  scrambled to round up support for their first budget resolution under President Trump. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=31.96s)]
*  They've been trying to push forward on the major tax cuts and spending cuts the presidents [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=36.68s)]
*  promised. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, what was supposed to be a routine vote turned into phone calls, conversations, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  deal making. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  You saw leadership pulling different members into a cloakroom off the side of the House [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  floor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=53.04s)]
*  But their incredibly thin majority, Republican leaders couldn't afford more than one or [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=54.44s)]
*  two defectors. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=58.76s)]
*  So in a chaotic scene, they cornered the Republicans who weren't on board, some of whom were concerned [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=59.76s)]
*  about how far the cuts could go. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=65.12s)]
*  At the same time, Robert says Democrats tried to rally the highest headcount that they could [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  to oppose it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=72.4s)]
*  You had one member fly from California after being in the hospital for some time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=73.96s)]
*  We're told that he flew with an IV in his arm on the plane just to get here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  When it came time to vote on the resolution, it was clear that Republicans didn't have [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=84.36s)]
*  the votes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=88.04s)]
*  They told members to go home, members grabbed their coats, came off the floor and started [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  heading for their cars. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=93.12s)]
*  But then moments later, the speaker came back and said, no, no, no, one more vote called [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  all the members back. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=100.08s)]
*  People came running through the halls to make sure they get back to the chamber to make [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=104.92s)]
*  sure that their vote was registered and vote was cast. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=107.94s)]
*  This vote, the ayes are 217, the nays are 215. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=110.64s)]
*  And by the end of the night, they succeeded. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=114.96s)]
*  They were able to get all of the votes needed to adopt this resolution. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=116.56s)]
*  Thank you all for staying on a long night. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  We got it done. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=124.56s)]
*  After the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson thanked Republicans for coming together on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=126.24s)]
*  the resolution. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=129.88s)]
*  We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the American First [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=131.04s)]
*  Agenda. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=134.8s)]
*  We're going to deliver all of it, not just parts of it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=135.8s)]
*  And this was the first step in that process. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=137.88s)]
*  So grateful to my colleagues. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=139.52s)]
*  The budget blueprint they adopted calls for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  federal spending cuts over the next decade. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  It does not dictate which taxes should be reduced or which cuts should be made. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=150.0s)]
*  That will all have to be hashed out now by lawmakers and what are guaranteed to be complex [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=155.24s)]
*  and politically heated negotiations. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  Democrats and some Republicans have raised concerns that the cuts will likely have to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=163.12s)]
*  come in part from social safety net programs like Medicaid and Medicare. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=167.24s)]
*  Republicans have largely denied that they'll slash those programs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=172.96s)]
*  But because of how the math of the budget deal checks out, those safety net programs [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=176.08s)]
*  will almost certainly be affected if it goes through. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=179.84s)]
*  Now three updates on immigration under the Trump administration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=190.24s)]
*  They will be fingerprinted. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=194.08s)]
*  They must announce that they are here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=195.52s)]
*  And if they do so, they can avoid criminal charges and fines. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security says it will require all undocumented immigrants over [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=201.36s)]
*  the age of 14 to register with the government or face prosecution. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=206.0s)]
*  It's unlikely that the millions of people living in the U.S. without permission will [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=211.44s)]
*  choose to come forward. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=214.96s)]
*  But the administration says it hopes that the threat of criminal charges, not just deportation, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=216.8s)]
*  will make undocumented immigrants choose to leave the country on their own. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=222.2s)]
*  Also on Tuesday, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  We're going to be doing something else that's going to be very, very good. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  We're going to be selling a gold card. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  You have a green card. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=237.88s)]
*  This is a gold card. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=238.88s)]
*  President Trump rolled out a new visa program he's calling a gold card. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=240.56s)]
*  It's effectively a replacement for a longstanding program that gives wealthy foreign investors [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  a path to U.S. citizenship. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=250.36s)]
*  It's a program that's been rife with fraud in the past and has even been used by international [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=252.68s)]
*  fugitives. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=257.12s)]
*  Trump gave few details about how gold card recipients will be vetted. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=259.0s)]
*  He said the price tag for each card will be about $5 million. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  And a federal judge has ordered the administration to temporarily restart a major refugee program [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=269.2s)]
*  that lets thousands of refugees into the country each year. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=275.36s)]
*  The judge said Trump likely overstepped his authority when he paused the program, which [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=278.76s)]
*  was established by Congress in 1980. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=283.56s)]
*  The administration is likely to fight the judge's order in court, but even before that, it's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  not clear it will comply with it at all. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=291.24s)]
*  Under Trump, federal agencies have been systematically finding loopholes to keep their policies in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=294.12s)]
*  place even after judges have told them to stop. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=299.06s)]
*  Newly released court records show that the FBI used DNA databases that were supposed [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=308.76s)]
*  to be off-limits to track down the suspect in a high-profile murder case. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=317.36s)]
*  The revelation comes from a hearing about the killing of four students at the University [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=322.48s)]
*  of Idaho back in 2022. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=326.2s)]
*  Investigators found DNA at the scene and ran it through their records, but didn't get [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=329.36s)]
*  a precise match. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=332.64s)]
*  Then they turned to consumer databases of genetic information. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=334.64s)]
*  The kind millions of people have been submitting samples to as they try to build out their [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=338.42s)]
*  family trees or do genetic testing for health reasons. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=342.14000000000004s)]
*  Some of those databases have privacy terms that allow for law enforcement access, but [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=346.18s)]
*  the FBI tapped a pair of services where the company and its customers had not consented. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=351.3s)]
*  That appears to have violated the government's own policy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=357.02000000000004s)]
*  Within days, the FBI landed on a suspect who had not been on their radar, a Ph.D. student [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=360.22s)]
*  who was then arrested and charged with the murders. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=365.22s)]
*  His lawyers have tried to challenge the DNA evidence, saying the government violated his [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=368.06s)]
*  constitutional rights with their database search, but a judge rejected that argument. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=371.92s)]
*  The FBI's actions raise questions about how people's sensitive genetic data is stored [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=377.26s)]
*  and accessed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=381.9s)]
*  Its use of restricted data could mean that any company's promise of privacy is essentially [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=383.46s)]
*  meaningless. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=388.02s)]
*  A new survey about religion in the U.S., published this morning, gives one of the clearest views [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=389.02s)]
*  of Americans' faith in over a decade. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=400.26s)]
*  A study from the Pew Research Center found that 62% of adults describe themselves as [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=403.18s)]
*  Christian, 30% say they're religiously unaffiliated, and 7% practice other religions. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=408.7s)]
*  The most significant revelation is that the number of Christians has started to hold [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=414.98s)]
*  steady after decades of sharp decline. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=418.74s)]
*  My colleague Ruth Graham, who covers religion, says one of a few factors driving people away [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=422.06s)]
*  from the church had been politics. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=426.98s)]
*  Democrats spent the last few decades leaving Christianity, not identifying as Christians, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=430.5s)]
*  leaving churches. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=434.98s)]
*  And there's a lot of things going on there, but social scientists say that it includes [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=436.5s)]
*  So what some of the social scientists I talked to for this story suggested is like everyone [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=441.06s)]
*  who was going to leave by now has left, and now you're kind of hitting the bedrock of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=451.62s)]
*  people who it's going to be sort of harder to peel them away. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=457.02000000000004s)]
*  And finally, 100 years ago this week, the music industry blew people's minds when it [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=464.86s)]
*  turned to a new innovation, the microphone. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=471.74s)]
*  People could record music before microphones, but it was extremely old school. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=480.76s)]
*  They used a recording horn, not funneled sound waves down to a stylus, which then cut grooves [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V76ZYOdR70Q&t=484.98s)]
