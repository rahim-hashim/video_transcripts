# Bishop Asks Trump to ‘Have Mercy,’ and Hegseth Faces New Accusations
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=4.68s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, January 22nd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=5.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=7.76s)]
*  Presidents in this country have broad powers, but they are not kings. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=14.6s)]
*  They do not have the power to unilaterally disregard our laws. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=19.84s)]
*  That's true for Donald Trump. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=23.8s)]
*  That's true for every president that came before him and every president who will come [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=24.84s)]
*  after him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Two days into his presidency, Donald Trump is facing pushback over his avalanche of executive [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  orders. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=34.16s)]
*  This is an extreme and unprecedented act, and this executive order is an assault on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=35.16s)]
*  the rule of law. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=40.44s)]
*  Twenty-two state attorneys general, including Matthew Plotkin of New Jersey, sued Trump [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=41.8s)]
*  on Tuesday over his executive order undermining birthright citizenship for the children of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=46.76s)]
*  undocumented immigrants. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=51.8s)]
*  They called it a clear violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=53.8s)]
*  We know that the executive order would wreak havoc and chaos. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=57.1s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of children who are born in this country to non-citizen parents [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=61.54s)]
*  each year will suddenly have an uncertain legal status. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=66.3s)]
*  That's at least 420 children born every single day. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=69.34s)]
*  If the order is not blocked by the courts, it will kick in next month. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=75.54s)]
*  Trump is also facing a lawsuit over his executive order that will make it easier to fire federal [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=79.66s)]
*  workers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=84.9s)]
*  Right now, those workers are supposed to be hired based on merit and can't be arbitrarily [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  dismissed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  But Trump's order could open the door for career civil servants to be replaced by political [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  appointees. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  And a union representing 50,000 government employees has sued, saying that could radically [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  reshape federal agencies and disrupt everything from law enforcement to environmental protection [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=103.18s)]
*  efforts. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  Also on Tuesday. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  Let me make one final plea, Mr. President. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  Trump faced a rare direct act of resistance when Bishop Marianne Edgar Buddy turned to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=115.94s)]
*  him as he was sitting in the front row during the inaugural prayer service at the National [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=121.42s)]
*  Cathedral. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=126.06s)]
*  I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=127.06s)]
*  that their parents will be taken away and that you help those who are fleeing war zones [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=131.9s)]
*  and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=137.02s)]
*  She called on Trump to consider the impact of his crackdown on immigration, and she said [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=143.38s)]
*  fear was spreading among LGBTQ Americans as Trump rolled back protections for transgender [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=153.74s)]
*  Trump looked away. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=155.06s)]
*  Buddy told the Times, quote, I wasn't necessarily calling the president out. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=156.74s)]
*  I was trying to say the country has been entrusted to you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  Late last night, Trump berated the bishop on social media, calling her a radical left [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=164.54s)]
*  hardline Trump hater and demanding an apology for the sermon. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=169.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Trump administration is pushing forward with its plans to dismantle diversity, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=174.66s)]
*  equity and inclusion initiatives inside the federal government. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  They've set a deadline of 5 p.m. today for federal agencies to place all their DEI staff [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=184.78s)]
*  on paid leave and come up with plans to shut down their offices. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=190.3s)]
*  They've also said outgoing staff will be questioned when they leave, but whether there [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=195.14s)]
*  are any remaining DEI efforts in place. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=198.94000000000003s)]
*  The executive order that outlines the rollback says that DEI initiatives undermine hard work [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=202.18s)]
*  and individual achievement in favor of a pernicious identity based system. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=208.10000000000002s)]
*  It marks a 180 degree turn from how the Biden administration saw DEI work as an effort to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=213.34s)]
*  support underserved communities and address racial inequalities. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=219.06s)]
*  And with that, I will welcome you to the Department of State. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=222.94s)]
*  Colleagues, the 72nd Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=232.1s)]
*  President Trump's first cabinet member, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has officially been [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=237.9s)]
*  sworn in. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=242.06s)]
*  For the former senator from Florida, the confirmation process was smooth. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=243.06s)]
*  The Senate voted 99 to 0 to approve him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=247.74s)]
*  But there's been a new complication for one of Trump's other highest level picks, Pete [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=251.0s)]
*  Hegseth for Secretary of Defense. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=255.88s)]
*  Yesterday, his former sister-in-law submitted a sworn statement to the Senate, saying she [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=258.28s)]
*  saw Hegseth drinking excessively on numerous occasions, including while in his military [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=263.68s)]
*  uniform. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=268.84s)]
*  She also claimed Hegseth was abusive towards his second wife, leading her to hide in a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=270.08s)]
*  closet on one occasion out of fear and text for help. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=274.72s)]
*  According to the affidavit, she did not witness the abuse firsthand, and Hegseth's ex-wife [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=278.8s)]
*  said in her own affidavit there was no physical abuse. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=283.26s)]
*  But the new allegations are strikingly similar to others that have surfaced about the former [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=286.92s)]
*  Fox News host and Army veteran, including a financial settlement he paid to a woman [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=291.24s)]
*  who accused him of rape. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=295.94s)]
*  Hegseth has vigorously denied the allegations against him, and Republicans are still pushing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  his nomination forward. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=303.16s)]
*  Senator Mark Wayne Mullen of Oklahoma told reporters yesterday that he thinks the allegations [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=305.52s)]
*  are part of a smear campaign. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=310.08s)]
*  Pete is going to be the Secretary of Defense, period. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=312.08s)]
*  The Danes can do whatever they want to, say whatever they want to, he's denied allegations. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=316.24s)]
*  A full Senate vote on Hegseth could come within days. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=320.64s)]
*  In Gaza, since the moment the ceasefire took effect this weekend, people have been trying [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=329.12s)]
*  to make their way back to their homes to assess the damage. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=333.4s)]
*  Many of the nearly two million people there were displaced at least once during the war, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=337.23999999999995s)]
*  and much of the territory has been destroyed by Israeli forces. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=341.76s)]
*  The Times spoke with one family from the city of Rafa. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  Before they were forced to leave, the Dahlez family lived in this two-story house next to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=349.4s)]
*  a farm where they kept sheep, rabbits, chickens. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=354.67999999999995s)]
*  They had olive groves and date palms. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=358.08s)]
*  This was a house that the father of the family had built back in 1971, and like a lot of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=361.54s)]
*  Gaza families, it was several generations living in the same house. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=367.86s)]
*  My colleagues Vivien Yee and Bilal Shabair have been reporting on the family's return [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=372.82s)]
*  home after eight months of living in tents. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=376.86s)]
*  As soon as the fighting stopped, they decided to try to see it for themselves. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=380.12s)]
*  They jumped in a car and set out for their old neighborhood, and they're driving around [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=386.72s)]
*  looking for their house and they just don't see anything, and they realize they had just [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  driven past it without even recognizing it because it was so destroyed. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  The grandfather who built the house was just so shocked that he kind of lost his breath [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=400.5s)]
*  and had to be taken back to their tent to recover and rest. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=406.78s)]
*  After absorbing that it was gone, they decided to try to look for anything they could salvage, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=413.06s)]
*  whether it was winter clothes for their kids or diplomas, but in the end they didn't find much. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=419.94s)]
*  Everything they found from this house that three generations of this family had grown [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=426.86s)]
*  up in fit into the back of their car. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=430.26s)]
*  Like a lot of Gazans, they would love to rebuild given the resources, but they're also just [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=434.78s)]
*  not sure will this ceasefire last? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=440.06s)]
*  Is the war actually going to end in any kind of stable way? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=442.92s)]
*  So if that happens, they're planning to clear some land and kind of camp out there until [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=447.36s)]
*  they can rebuild, but they're not even sure that will happen. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=453.6s)]
*  And finally... [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=466.92s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about snow in Florida, folks. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=467.92s)]
*  Frosted trees and snow are covering the highways. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=470.8s)]
*  A record-breaking winter storm sweeping across the southern U.S., piling up snow where that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=472.7s)]
*  just does not happen. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  Can you believe this picture right now in Baton Rouge, Louisiana? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=479.82s)]
*  The first ever blizzard warning was issued for parts of Texas and Louisiana. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=483.46s)]
*  At least 10 people have died in the storm, thousands of flights have been canceled, airports [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=488.24s)]
*  closed and whole stretches of highway, including Interstate 10, have been shut down. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=492.9s)]
*  Still, the rare sight of any snow at all has brought many people outside. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=497.76s)]
*  In New Orleans, people are using the levees as ski slopes, and kids who've never had [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=502.66s)]
*  any reason in their whole lives to own a sled have been out there sliding down hills on [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=507.22s)]
*  cookie sheets. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=511.54s)]
*  The last time a lot of the region got this much snow was the Gulf Storm of 1895. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=513.1800000000001s)]
*  The mayor of Pensacola, Florida, where the snow's been stacking up, said some people [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTibq8aK1Ps&t=518.58s)]
