# Trump and Harris Neck and Neck in a New Poll, and a Manhunt in Kentucky
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=4.9s)]
*  Today is Monday, September 9th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=5.9s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=8.26s)]
*  A new national poll of likely voters from the Times and Siena College shows Donald Trump [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=14.24s)]
*  and Kamala Harris are neck and neck, Trump's sitting at 48% to Harris's 47, with a three-point [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=19.12s)]
*  margin of error. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=26.18s)]
*  That leaves them in an incredibly tight race, with only eight weeks to go until election [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=27.9s)]
*  day. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=32.54s)]
*  And the poll highlights some potential weaknesses for Harris, who had been riding a wave of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=33.54s)]
*  enthusiasm since she entered the race earlier this summer. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=38.1s)]
*  What it shows for Kamala Harris is that there are still a lot of voters, about 28%, who [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=41.28s)]
*  say they don't know enough about her. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=47.66s)]
*  And a good chunk of those say they don't really know what her policies are. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=51.04s)]
*  Jonathan Weissman covers politics for the Times. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=56.46s)]
*  But remember, there's a debate on Tuesday night. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=59.34s)]
*  And what this poll really shows for Harris is that this is a moment for her to get her [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=62.86s)]
*  points across, to get herself better known to the voters. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=69.34s)]
*  People are watching Kamala Harris to see how she comes off, whether they feel confident [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=74.18s)]
*  in their support for her. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=80.72s)]
*  So I think the pressure is really on her, and she has to win people over and win people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=82.34s)]
*  over fast. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=88.34s)]
*  Donald Trump, on the other hand, he's a very known commodity. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=90.06s)]
*  And only a small percentage of voters say they need to know more about Trump before [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  they can decide who to vote for in November. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=99.34s)]
*  For more on the new poll numbers, you can listen to today's episode of The Daily. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=104.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's entering this week on the back of a significant legal victory. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=112.58s)]
*  On Friday, the judge in his Manhattan hush money case postponed sentencing for his 34 [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=117.9s)]
*  felony convictions until after the election. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=122.86s)]
*  Citing the unique time frame this matter currently finds itself in, Justice Juan Marchand rescheduled [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  it for November 26. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=132.06s)]
*  In Tennessee, a federal trial over the death of Tyree Nichols during a traffic stop starts [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=134.06s)]
*  today. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=145.94s)]
*  Footage of Memphis police officers chasing, kicking, and punching Nichols, a black man, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=146.94s)]
*  horrified the city and the country when it came out last January. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=152.54s)]
*  The unit the officers belonged to was disbanded, and five officers were fired. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=156.34s)]
*  Three of them will now be on trial on charges of depriving Nichols of his civil rights. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=161.3s)]
*  They also face second degree murder charges at the state level. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=166.02s)]
*  I spoke with Tyree's mother and stepfather, and for them, this is going to be a really [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=169.38000000000002s)]
*  emotional few weeks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=175.38000000000002s)]
*  Emily Cochran is covering the trial for the Times. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=177.58s)]
*  Mrs. Wells, Tyree's mother, still hasn't watched the footage of what happened to her son that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  night. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=186.82000000000002s)]
*  They're looking for answers, namely, it's still not entirely clear why he was stopped [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=187.82s)]
*  that night, and they're hoping to finally get an answer to that question. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=198.9s)]
*  Emily says that even though officers were fired and charged, there's a feeling that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=205.98s)]
*  other efforts at police accountability in Memphis have stalled. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=210.66s)]
*  She says one reform that Nichols' family supported would have prevented police from [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=214.86s)]
*  stopping cars for minor traffic infractions, but that was repealed by the state's Republican-controlled [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=219.3s)]
*  legislature. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=225.18s)]
*  He couldn't have picked an area that is any more remote and difficult for us to try to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=226.18s)]
*  locate him, and that's what we want to do. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=239.74s)]
*  We want to safely, we don't want our guys to get hurt. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=241.78000000000003s)]
*  We don't want any more of the public to be hurt. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  A manhunt is still underway in rural Kentucky after authorities say a man shot at drivers [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=246.7s)]
*  traveling along Interstate 75 on Saturday, hitting 12 vehicles and seriously injuring [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=251.62s)]
*  five people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=257.42s)]
*  We recovered a weapon, but who's to say that he doesn't have another weapon? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=259.1s)]
*  It seems like he's planned numerous parts of this anyway, so we have to anticipate that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=262.42s)]
*  The suspect, a 32-year-old Kentucky native and former National Guardsman, had been arrested [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=269.54s)]
*  earlier this year on a terroristic threatening charge, but it was later dismissed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=274.82s)]
*  On Saturday, authorities say he bought an AR-15 rifle and a thousand rounds of ammunition, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=280.38s)]
*  then opened fire on the interstate from a cliff ledge before disappearing into the dense [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=286.46s)]
*  woods. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=290.94s)]
*  Authorities established a perimeter around the area, but had to call off the search on [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=292.7s)]
*  Saturday and Sunday nights when it got dark. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=296.34s)]
*  They plan to resume the manhunt this morning with dogs, a helicopter, and a drone with [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=299.26s)]
*  an infrared scanner. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=303.62s)]
*  Venezuela's opposition candidate, Edmundo González, fled to Spain over the weekend, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=312.78s)]
*  as the Venezuelan government continues its brutal post-election crackdown. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=317.9s)]
*  González had been widely expected to win the presidential election in July, and voting [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=322.82s)]
*  data released by his party showed that he did. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  But despite protests and international outcry, the authoritarian leader Nicolas Maduro has [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=331.18s)]
*  held onto power. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=336.62s)]
*  Thousands of demonstrators have been arrested, and security forces have now surrounded a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  diplomatic residence in the country's capital, where top opposition leaders have been sheltering. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=343.14000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, efforts by Brazil, Mexico, and other countries in the region to broker a [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=348.74s)]
*  resolution to the crisis have failed. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  And there are fears that the political turmoil will drive even more of Venezuela's population [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  out of the country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=360.74s)]
*  More than a quarter of Venezuelans have left in recent years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=362.46s)]
*  Times reporter Frances Robles has been reporting from the country's second largest city, which [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=366.5s)]
*  she says has been completely hollowed out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=371.14s)]
*  Maracaibo used to be this thriving oil town, and now you see a completely different city. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=373.65999999999997s)]
*  You see a place where the houses have literally been stripped for parts. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=381.26s)]
*  People take the windows and roofs off and sell them before they leave. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=387.38s)]
*  Everybody talks about how there used to be so much traffic, and now the streets are really, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=392.26s)]
*  really quiet. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=398.62s)]
*  And it's kind of a sad place, to be honest. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=400.34s)]
*  Frances says that the city was decimated by the collapse of the state oil company about [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  a decade ago, and then hit hard by U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=408.86s)]
*  Half a million people have left. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=413.7s)]
*  We know that most of the people who have left are kind of that working age, 18 to 45 years [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=415.94s)]
*  old. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=422.94s)]
*  And a lot of them left their little kids behind with their parents while they get situated [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=423.94s)]
*  in whatever country they landed in. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=427.94s)]
*  They've gone to Chile, they've gone to Colombia, they've gone to the United States. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=429.98s)]
*  So you have a lot of retirees making $3 a month in their pensions, really struggling [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=434.46s)]
*  to make ends meet. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=440.46s)]
*  They talk a lot about how everywhere you go, you see that everybody's gone. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=442.26s)]
*  So the doctor's office, the doctors are gone, the nurses are gone, the bus drivers are gone, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=447.7s)]
*  the police officers. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  And then meanwhile, the power goes out every week or so, the water goes out every week [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=453.65999999999997s)]
*  or so. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=459.06s)]
*  It's really a struggle for people. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=460.06s)]
*  In fact, one older woman who was taking care of her grandchildren, who I interviewed, she's [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=461.66s)]
*  already gone. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=467.3s)]
*  By the time the story published, she had already hit the road and trekked through the Darien [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=468.3s)]
*  Gap jungle in order to get to the United States. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=473.18s)]
*  And so far, she made it to Mexico. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=477.14s)]
*  And I think there's going to be a lot more people behind her. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=479.14s)]
*  And finally, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=489.02s)]
*  The 2024 NFL regular season just started last week, but the Super Bowl already has [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=491.5s)]
*  a headliner. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=500.9s)]
*  What's up everybody? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=501.9s)]
*  My name is Kendrick Lamar and I'll be performing at Super Bowl 59. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=502.9s)]
*  The rapper Kendrick Lamar announced yesterday that he'll perform at the halftime show this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=507.26s)]
*  February in New Orleans. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=511.06s)]
*  Lamar already performed at the Super Bowl in 2022 when hip hop was showcased for the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=513.26s)]
*  first time ever there, kind of belatedly, with superstars Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=518.18s)]
*  Blige and more. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=523.66s)]
*  The Super Bowl's organizers have been accused of overlooking hip hop in the past. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=525.42s)]
*  Lamar said, quote, rap music is still the most impactful genre to date. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=529.8199999999999s)]
*  And I'll be there to remind the world why. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=534.78s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm talking about man. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=537.1s)]
*  Now we can get to it for real. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWE6INdqpE&t=540.86s)]
