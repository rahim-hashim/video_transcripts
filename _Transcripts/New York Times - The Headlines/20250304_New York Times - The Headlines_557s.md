# The Tariffs Are On, and Trump Suspends Ukraine Aid
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, March [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=0.0s)]
*  4th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=7.36s)]
*  Just after midnight, the sweeping new tariffs that President Trump has been threatening [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  against America's largest trading partners kicked in. There's now a new 25% surcharge [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=17.94s)]
*  on products from Canada and Mexico, and an extra 10% on goods from China on top of existing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=24.32s)]
*  tariffs. President Trump had been framing the tariffs as a national security issue, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  claiming that Canada and Mexico in particular weren't doing enough to stop migrants and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=36.08s)]
*  fentanyl from coming into the U.S. Those countries have spent weeks scrambling to show Trump [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  that they were stepping up enforcement. But yesterday, hours before the tariffs started, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Trump seemed to move the goalposts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=50.88s)]
*  So what they have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things in the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=53.04s)]
*  United States, in which case they have no tariffs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=56.76s)]
*  He suggested that the only way out of the surcharges would be for auto companies and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=59.76s)]
*  other manufacturers to relocate to the U.S. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=64.32s)]
*  I would just say this to people in Canada or Mexico, if they're going to build car [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=67.36s)]
*  plants, the people that are doing them are much better off building here because we have [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  the market, we're the market where they sell the most. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=75.8s)]
*  The tariffs are already sending shockwaves through the economy. The stock market had [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=78.6s)]
*  its biggest drop off of the year when it became clear they were about to take effect. And [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=83.52s)]
*  economists say Americans will probably see higher prices on a wide range of products. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  The first place they're going to feel it is the grocery store. Much of the fresh produce [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=93.8s)]
*  in the U.S., everything from tomatoes to avocados, is imported from Mexico. Prices could start [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=98.52s)]
*  to climb in the next few weeks. Beef, grain and maple syrup from Canada will also likely [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=104.3s)]
*  get more expensive. And over time, prices could also go up on cars, toys, smartphones [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=109.62s)]
*  and a whole range of consumer goods. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  In response to Trump's tariffs, Canada immediately slapped its own surcharges on American imports [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=118.82s)]
*  and China also moved quickly to retaliate, putting tariffs on American food and agricultural [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=125.14s)]
*  products and blocking a number of American companies from doing business in China. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=130.82s)]
*  In another major move from the Trump administration, the president temporarily suspended all U.S. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=140.1s)]
*  military aid to Ukraine three days after he berated Vladimir Zelensky in the Oval Office. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=146.26s)]
*  Officials say the suspension will be in place until Trump determines that Ukraine has made [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=153.22s)]
*  a good faith commitment to peace negotiations with Russia. The order affects more than a [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=157.7s)]
*  billion dollars in arms and ammunition that were on order or even already en route. Analysts [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=163.06s)]
*  say Ukraine can keep its war effort going for weeks, even a few months, without U.S. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=169.01999999999998s)]
*  support. It did that last year when Republicans in Congress temporarily blocked assistance. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  But the cracks did start to show. Without well-stocked air defense systems, more Russian [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=179.78s)]
*  missiles got through, hitting cities and power plants. And without enough supplies [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=185.32s)]
*  on the front lines, Ukrainian commanders told the Times they had to ration ammunition. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  Effectively, Trump's new pause is an ultimatum for Zelensky. Either get on board with ceasefire [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=195.6s)]
*  terms that Trump dictates or prepare to face larger battlefield losses without U.S. support. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=201.88s)]
*  In the meantime, analysts say the pause will help Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=208.7s)]
*  troops could make gains against a weakened Ukraine. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=213.38s)]
*  On the heels of his aid freeze and the new tariffs, President Trump will give his first [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=219.38s)]
*  big address to a joint session of Congress tonight. It's at 9 p.m. Eastern, and it'll [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=224.16s)]
*  be his largest televised event since he returned to office. Presidents usually use this moment [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=229.06s)]
*  to lay out their plans for their time in the White House. Trump's expected to tick through [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  his work on immigration, spending cuts, and a host of executive orders. Many Democratic [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=239.9s)]
*  lawmakers say they plan to protest Trump's actions so far by inviting fired federal workers [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  as their guests to the speech. The Times will have live coverage of Trump's comments at [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=252.72s)]
*  NYTimes.com. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=257.66s)]
*  What New York set out to create was a program that could be a national model to bring in [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=264.9s)]
*  people that they once targeted for selling marijuana or growing it and help them to become [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=270.06s)]
*  successful business owners in this newly legal industry. But it failed pretty spectacularly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=277.34s)]
*  Ashley Southall covers cannabis legalization for the Times. She's been reporting on the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=284.38s)]
*  rise and fall of an ambitious program in New York State that the governor once said would [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  quote, write historical wrongs. After recreational cannabis was legalized there in 2021, the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=294.34s)]
*  state backed a $200 million fund to give people who'd been prosecuted for drug offenses a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=301.73999999999995s)]
*  leg up in the new market. It was supposed to launch 150 small cannabis shops providing [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=307.46s)]
*  property and loans. Only 22 have gone up. And Ashley says many of the participants in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=313.67999999999995s)]
*  the program told her they feel they've been caught in a debt trap. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  One of the people I talked to was Roland Connor, who was the first person to open a dispensary [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=323.78s)]
*  under this program. And what he described was a program that was one in which he had [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=330.73999999999995s)]
*  very little control. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=337.14s)]
*  Connor and others told Ashley that the loans they got from the fund were so tightly restricted, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=339.26s)]
*  they had almost no say in how their stores were designed and built and no oversight of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  construction costs. That effectively handcuffed them as they were trying to compete with a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=349.74s)]
*  flood of new illicit cannabis shops that started popping up across the state. For his part, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=354.94s)]
*  Connor ended up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=361.26s)]
*  So you have a guy like Connor who has every reason to be skeptical of the government because [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=364.5s)]
*  he has been prosecuted for selling marijuana. But he casts that aside and decides to take [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=368.46000000000004s)]
*  the government up on its promise of first dibs on a windfall from legalization. And [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=375.34s)]
*  he ends up facing financial ruin. It got so bad for him that at one point he was starting [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  to wonder if this whole program was smoke and mirrors. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  In response to questions from the Times, a publicist for the fund said criticism of the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=393.09999999999997s)]
*  program was, quote, absurd, claiming it had given opportunities to people other lenders [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=397.38s)]
*  wouldn't have taken a chance on. Recently, Connor and other participants in the program [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=402.74s)]
*  asked the governor to shut the program down altogether and refinance their debt. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=407.82s)]
*  And finally, who's the sweatiest person on the rugby team? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=418.66s)]
*  Um, let me think. Let me think. Hello. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=421.18s)]
*  A lot of people who first saw Alona Mar on social media had never watched a rugby match. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=424.58s)]
*  The American athlete and TikTok favorite has been giving the sport a bump. It started during [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=430.3s)]
*  the summer's Olympics when Mar shared a lot of videos of giant croissants, but also footage [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=435.78000000000003s)]
*  of her on the field helping Team USA take the bronze. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=440.94000000000005s)]
*  Since then, she's built a massive following, eight million people and counting with her [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=448.86s)]
*  mix of the goofy and the confessional lip syncing to the Kardashians, also talking [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  body positivity. I have cellulite everywhere. It is completely normal, completely natural. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=458.14s)]
*  It does not take away from your athletic ability. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=463.06s)]
*  This season, she took her newfound fame to England, playing for the Bristol Bears in [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  the country's top women's rugby league. And here is Alona Mar. Oh, she's going to do it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=470.06s)]
*  It is quite simply marvelous. She just wrapped her stint with the Bears this past weekend [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=476.06s)]
*  and her presence was transformative. Team merchandise sales went through the roof. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=483.46s)]
*  They had record attendance and even had to temporarily move stadiums from a 2000 seat [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=488.34s)]
*  venue to one with 27,000 seats. Overall, it was a major boost for a league where many [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=493.78s)]
*  of the players have to work other jobs to support themselves. And Mar herself said she [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=500.38s)]
*  hopes the momentum behind the sport will continue to build. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=505.32s)]
*  Women's rugby is changing and it's really, I think, making the world and people a better [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=508.62s)]
*  place. I don't know what I'm saying, but please keep coming out and supporting and fill these seats. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=514.42s)]
*  Mar is planning to be back in England this summer, though in an American jersey, for [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=519.42s)]
*  the Women's Rugby World Cup. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=524.02s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, the Department of Government Efficiency claims [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=529.62s)]
*  it's cut tens of billions of dollars in wasteful spending so far. A look at how that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=534.98s)]
*  math does not add up. That's next in the New York Times audio app. You can listen wherever [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=540.58s)]
*  you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho_3uCfpwxY&t=546.34s)]
