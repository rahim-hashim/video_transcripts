# Trump’s Call with Putin, and Ozempic’s Effect on Drinking
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Thursday, February 13th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=8.36s)]
*  We had a great call and it lasted for a long time, over an hour. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=14.84s)]
*  President Trump said he had a productive call with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=21.32s)]
*  about how to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  I think I can say with great confidence he wants to see it ended also. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=28.82s)]
*  That's good. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=32.94s)]
*  And we're going to work toward getting it ended and as fast as possible. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=34.4s)]
*  Their conversation marks a dramatic break from how the U.S. had approached Russia as [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=38.980000000000004s)]
*  an adversary that needed to be isolated. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=43.68s)]
*  Trump is now taking a different tack. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=46.42s)]
*  We ultimately expect to meet. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=48.94s)]
*  In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=50.5s)]
*  The idea that the U.S. and Russia might be the ones deciding how the war ends has raised [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=55.02s)]
*  concerns in Ukraine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=60.06s)]
*  The Biden administration had previously said it would follow Ukraine's lead for any peace [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=62.14s)]
*  talks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=66.7s)]
*  Now, Ukraine could be sidelined. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=67.7s)]
*  Trump didn't call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until after he'd talked with Putin. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=69.94s)]
*  For the moment, it's unclear what a deal to end the war would look like, but Putin suggested [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=75.86s)]
*  on Wednesday that Russia won't stop fighting without some concessions and Ukraine will [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=80.82s)]
*  likely have little leverage. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=85.82s)]
*  It's insisted that it wants to regain all the territory Russia has seized going back [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=87.97999999999999s)]
*  to 2014. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  But yesterday, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called that unrealistic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=93.61999999999999s)]
*  As part of its promised crackdown on immigration, the Trump administration has now flown nearly [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=99.02s)]
*  a hundred migrants to Guantanamo Bay. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=110.78s)]
*  Some are being housed in an empty wing of the prison complex built to hold terrorism [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=114.02s)]
*  suspects after 9-11 and are being guarded by troops. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=118.18s)]
*  Officials say many of the migrants are violent gang members from Venezuela, but they haven't [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=122.58s)]
*  released their identities or any evidence of their connections to criminal activity. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=126.82s)]
*  The Times has only been able to find out who half of them are. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=132.14s)]
*  Keeping the names quiet makes it harder for lawyers to challenge their detention and keeps [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=135.5s)]
*  the migrants' families in the dark about where they are. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=140.42s)]
*  One woman only found out that her brother was there when she saw him in a photo online. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  Just a couple of days ago, she was scrolling through TikTok, as one does, when she suddenly [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=147.82s)]
*  saw a picture of her brother that had been posted by the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=153.48s)]
*  My colleague Julie Turkowitz spoke with Yehira Castillo, whose brother Luis Alberto Castillo [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=160.82s)]
*  photo at the base with his head down, being led by a man wearing camo and latex gloves. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=166.42s)]
*  So I said to her, you know, the U.S. government has said that your brother is among the worst [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=172.33999999999997s)]
*  of the worst. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=177.89999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. government says that he is a member of the criminal group, the Tren de Aragua. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=179.26s)]
*  Is this true? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  And she says over and over again in the conversation, cual criminal, que criminal, she says, my [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=187.1s)]
*  brother is not a criminal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=192.74s)]
*  And she says he's the father of one. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=195.94s)]
*  He's from Venezuela. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  He had been living in Colombia trying to make a living, wasn't making very much money, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=199.08s)]
*  went to the U.S. to make a better life and somehow got wrapped up in this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=204.18s)]
*  Julie says people familiar with Castillo's arrest told her officials suspected him of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=210.02s)]
*  gang activity because he has a Michael Jordan tattoo on his neck. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=214.3s)]
*  But a Jordan tattoo isn't necessarily a clear indicator since basketball has been incredibly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=218.3s)]
*  popular in Venezuela for decades. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=222.64s)]
*  When asked, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security first told the Times [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=225.6s)]
*  that officers couldn't determine whether Castillo was a gang member, saying, he may very well [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=230.44s)]
*  be, he may not be. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=235.6s)]
*  In a follow up, she said they had new information that he was but did not share it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  I think that what this case tells us is that we have the Department of Homeland Security [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=241.56s)]
*  telling the American public that it is sending the most violent criminals, members of the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  criminal group, the Tren de Aragua. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=252.56s)]
*  But we don't really have any evidence to back up what the government is saying. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  So we really have no clue who could be sent to Guantanamo Bay in the future. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=260.76s)]
*  Here's four other brief updates on the Trump administration. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=270.56s)]
*  One of Trump's most divisive cabinet picks, Tulsi Gabbard, has now been sworn in as director [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=274.72s)]
*  of national intelligence. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=279.78s)]
*  She'll oversee America's spy agencies and give the president his daily intelligence [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=281.76s)]
*  report. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  There were bipartisan concerns that she's been too supportive of authoritarian leaders [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=287.0s)]
*  like Bashar al-Assad of Syria. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=291.48s)]
*  But only one Republican senator voted against her confirmation, Mitch McConnell, who said [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=294.08s)]
*  she showed, quote, a history of alarming lapses in judgment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=298.74s)]
*  On Wednesday, the White House got the green light to move forward with its plan to pay [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=304.2s)]
*  federal workers to resign. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=307.64s)]
*  A judge ruled that the unions who challenged the offer didn't have the legal standing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=309.84s)]
*  to do so. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  Seventy five thousand government employees have already volunteered to leave their jobs [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  in exchange for getting paid through September. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=319.44s)]
*  That's about three percent of the federal civilian workforce. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  Over at the State Department, documents show that officials are planning a massive contract [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=326.4s)]
*  with Elon Musk's company, Tesla. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=331.0s)]
*  The agency says it will spend four hundred million dollars on armored vehicles this year, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=334.28s)]
*  specifically souped up versions of the sci-fi looking Cybertruck. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=339.44s)]
*  Musk was one of the Trump campaign's biggest donors, and he's been leading the administration's [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  efforts to reduce government spending. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=348.16s)]
*  And across the country, some Republican lawmakers have been working to keep federal dollars [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=351.92s)]
*  flowing to their districts, even as they publicly cheer on Trump's drastic cuts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=356.48s)]
*  They've been quietly asking for carve outs and special exemptions. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=361.72s)]
*  For example, Republicans from states with a lot of farming have been scrambling to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=366.28s)]
*  save a foreign aid program that bought huge amounts of crops from American farmers to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=370.0s)]
*  distribute overseas. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  For the past few years, people taking wildly popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic have [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=385.4s)]
*  been reporting an unexpected side effect. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=390.52s)]
*  They were drinking less. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, new research is backing that up. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=395.36s)]
*  A study published yesterday in the journal JAMA followed adults who struggled to control [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=398.36s)]
*  their alcohol consumption. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=403.4s)]
*  Over the course of the research, the group who was given the key ingredient in Ozempic, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=405.56s)]
*  semaglutide, drank noticeably less than others who were given a placebo. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=409.64s)]
*  Researchers think that since the drug impacts reward pathways in the brain, it can make [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=415.36s)]
*  alcohol less enticing in the same way it makes food less appealing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=419.88s)]
*  The caveat? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=424.48s)]
*  The new study was small, with less than 50 people, and doctors warned that more data [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=425.48s)]
*  is needed before the drug could actually be prescribed for treating substance abuse disorders. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=430.20000000000005s)]
*  And finally, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, which everybody totally remembered, right? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=439.68s)]
*  It is the day of a million bouquets, and the Times climate desk has been looking into the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=445.40000000000003s)]
*  environmental impact of the flower trade. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  It's actually a rough time of year to have a flower-centric holiday. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=453.4s)]
*  Not a lot blooms in the U.S. in the winter. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=456.44s)]
*  Definitely not millions and millions of red roses. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=459.08s)]
*  So right now, whole loads of fresh flowers are being flown into the country on refrigerated [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=461.96s)]
*  planes from Colombia and Ecuador. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=467.76s)]
*  But anyone looking for something grown closer to home, potentially with a smaller carbon [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=470.8s)]
*  footprint, can look for tulips. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=474.52s)]
*  The U.S. used to rely on the Netherlands for those, but over the last decade, a bunch of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=476.92s)]
*  American growers have gotten into the business. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=481.28s)]
*  Tulips are now the only flower mass grown in the U.S. in the winter on such a scale [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=484.52s)]
*  that you can find them at most local shops. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=489.2s)]
*  And for anyone who is feeling less sentimental, less romantic, a reminder, there's a lot [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oZ7SmBNpgI&t=492.2s)]
