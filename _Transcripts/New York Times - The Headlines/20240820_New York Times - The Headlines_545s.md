# Biden Passes Torch to Harris, and Blinken Pushes for Gaza Cease-Fire
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4)
*  I'm Julian Barnes. I'm an intelligence reporter at the New York Times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=0.0s)]
*  I try to find out what the US government is keeping secret. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=4.0s)]
*  It takes a lot of time to find people willing to talk about those secrets. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=7.0s)]
*  It requires talking to a lot of people to make sure that we're not misled [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=12.0s)]
*  and that we give a complete story to our readers. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=16.0s)]
*  If the New York Times was not reporting these stories, some of them might never come to light. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=19.0s)]
*  If you want to support this kind of work, you can do that by subscribing to the New York Times. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=26.0s)]
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=33.0s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, August 20th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=36.0s)]
*  Hello, Democrats! [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=46.0s)]
*  Are you as excited as I am? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=50.0s)]
*  The Democratic National Convention kicked off last night in Chicago, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=55.0s)]
*  and in speech after speech, party officials, politicians, and union leaders hailed Kamala Harris, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=59.0s)]
*  the first South Asian American and first Black woman to ever lead a major party ticket for president. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=66.0s)]
*  This is when we break through. The future is here. It's in our grasp. Let's go with it! [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=72.0s)]
*  In her speech, Hillary Clinton made an emotional call for Harris to break the glass ceiling, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=81.0s)]
*  something she herself nearly did in 2016. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=86.0s)]
*  The convention ran late into the night, stretching until almost midnight, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=89.0s)]
*  as the main speaker took the stage, President Joe Biden. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=94.0s)]
*  Thank you, thank you, thank you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=97.0s)]
*  The crowds roared for the president, who just a month ago was expected to be the nominee himself. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=99.0s)]
*  Listen, from the second that he walked out, he was greeted by just a wall of applause and shouts of, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=105.0s)]
*  we love Joe, and it went on and on. I think somebody counted it, it went on for like four minutes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=111.0s)]
*  Times reporter Adam Nagourney was at the convention, covering Biden's speech. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=117.0s)]
*  The hall was packed. I mean, I didn't see a single empty seat there, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=121.0s)]
*  and the word was the fire marshals were threatening to close down the place because there were so many people there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=124.0s)]
*  And there was a lot of excitement in the air. I think that people really realized that this was an historic moment. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=128.0s)]
*  Let me ask you, are you ready to vote for freedom? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=134.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=139.0s)]
*  I think Biden was very much doing a victory lap. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=140.0s)]
*  I think Biden was very much sort of like reviewing what he sees as a very, very successful three and a half years as president, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=144.0s)]
*  ticking through all his accomplishments, right? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=151.0s)]
*  Because of you, and I'm not exaggerating, because of you, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=153.0s)]
*  we've had one of the most extraordinary four years of progress ever, period. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=158.0s)]
*  Well, I say we, I mean Kamala and me. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=164.0s)]
*  But at the same time, he was being very careful about sharing the credit for that with Kamala Harris. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=170.0s)]
*  We finally beat Big Pharma. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=177.0s)]
*  And guess who cast the tie breaking vote? Vice President, shouldn't it be President Kamala Harris? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=185.0s)]
*  And again and again, he talked about how the accomplishments that he had were the accomplishments that he made with his vice president. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=193.0s)]
*  And he talked about choosing her as his vice president as being the best decision he ever made. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=200.0s)]
*  And he gave her his complete endorsement. And that was a sort of subtext of everything that he was saying. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=204.0s)]
*  While Biden vowed to stay on the campaign trail to help Harris get elected, Adam says that his speech was also a kind of farewell address. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=210.0s)]
*  And I can't sing where the dam's, I'm not going to try. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=219.0s)]
*  And Biden closed it out, quoting from the song American Anthem. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=222.0s)]
*  What shall our legacy be? What will our children say? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=226.0s)]
*  Let me know in my heart when my days are through. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=232.0s)]
*  America, America, I gave my best to you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=236.0s)]
*  For more about Biden's message to the Democratic Party, listen to today's episode of The Daily. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=242.0s)]
*  The Democratic National Convention will continue tonight, where former President Barack Obama is scheduled to speak. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=249.0s)]
*  Israel says it recovered the bodies of six hostages from southern Gaza after an overnight military operation. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=261.0s)]
*  Five of the six were already known to have died in captivity. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=268.0s)]
*  The recovery comes as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the Middle East to continue to push for progress towards a ceasefire deal and the release of the remaining hostages. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=272.0s)]
*  In a very constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, he confirmed to me that Israel accepts the bridging proposal. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=283.0s)]
*  In Jerusalem yesterday, Blinken said Israel has accepted a proposal to bridge some of the final remaining differences with Hamas on a ceasefire deal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=291.0s)]
*  He and other mediators have been urging both sides to accept the terms that the Biden administration laid out earlier this year. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=300.0s)]
*  Hamas had broadly accepted that original framework, but has said that since then the details of the deal have slanted in Israel's favor and the group hasn't been participating directly in negotiations. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=307.0s)]
*  While Israel's decision to publicly support the bridging proposal puts more pressure on Hamas, privately some Israeli officials say they don't think that the Biden administration's proposal will lead to a breakthrough. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=319.0s)]
*  There are still major disagreements between the two sides, including whether or not Israeli troops should be allowed to patrol the Gaza-Egypt border. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=332.0s)]
*  Israel says that's necessary to prevent Hamas from re-arming. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=341.0s)]
*  Hamas says it won't agree to any deal that doesn't include the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=346.0s)]
*  In Mexico, thousands of judges and court workers are now on an indefinite strike as they protest the president's attempt to overhaul the judicial system there. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=358.0s)]
*  Currently, many of Mexico's judges are appointed based on their qualifications and specialized training. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=367.0s)]
*  But President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wants them to be elected instead in what would be the most significant change to the country's court system in decades. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=374.0s)]
*  He says that the reforms would root out, quote, corruption and privileges in the judiciary. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=384.0s)]
*  But his critics call it a power grab. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=389.0s)]
*  They say it would let Obrador and his party use their political power to take control of the courts. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=392.0s)]
*  And judicial experts have warned that the overhaul could threaten judicial independence and undermine the rule of law. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=397.0s)]
*  If the system is changed, all 11 of Mexico's Supreme Court justices could be forced to step down. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=404.0s)]
*  Obrador is hoping to get the measure passed next month. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=411.0s)]
*  In the meantime, as the strike goes into effect, hundreds of courthouses across Mexico are expected to close. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=415.0s)]
*  And some court workers have already locked the entrances to the buildings with chains. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=422.0s)]
*  And finally. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=431.0s)]
*  Can you imagine 1030 in the morning, turn on television, there's this Donahue guy with the most hated woman in America. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=432.0s)]
*  Phil Donahue, who is credited with reinventing the television talk show, died this week at 88 years old. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=441.0s)]
*  When he first went on TV in the 1960s, he pushed the boundaries for what you could show. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=449.0s)]
*  In his first episode, he interviewed an atheist. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=454.0s)]
*  Shocking at the time. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=457.0s)]
*  He went on to talk to strippers. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=458.0s)]
*  He televised a live birth. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=460.0s)]
*  And he was among the first TV hosts to discuss the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=462.0s)]
*  A significant and serious disease has struck the gay community. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=467.0s)]
*  And let's see how much sense we can make out of this at the outset. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=475.0s)]
*  He also let the audience weigh in, walking the aisles and handing off the microphone for their questions. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=478.0s)]
*  Something that hadn't really been done before. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=484.0s)]
*  His show ran for more than 6000 episodes and won 20 daytime Emmys. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=486.0s)]
*  But by the 1980s, he was overtaken by a new name in TV that built on his format, but made it her own. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=492.0s)]
*  Oprah Winfrey. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=499.0s)]
*  Other TV hosts like Jerry Springer, Geraldo Rivera and Sally Jesse Raphael also came along and picked up the taboo topics that he'd put front and center on TV. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=501.0s)]
*  Donahue called them, quote, my illegitimate children. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=511.0s)]
*  Donahue went off the air in 1996, then attempted a brief comeback on MSNBC in the early 2000s. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=515.0s)]
*  The host once mused about what should go on his headstone after he died. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=523.0s)]
*  And he said it should be, here lies Phil. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=528.0s)]
*  Occasionally he went too far. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=532.0s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=535.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=537.0s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gzGMuhyji4&t=538.0s)]
