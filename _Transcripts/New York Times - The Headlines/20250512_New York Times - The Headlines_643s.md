# Drop in U.S.-China Tariffs, a New Air Travel Warning, Pope’s Childhood Home for Sale | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, May 12th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Early this morning, the US and China said they've reached an agreement to temporarily [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=14.18s)]
*  suspend the sky-high tariffs they've imposed on each other. The suspension will last 90 [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=17.88s)]
*  days, giving the world's two largest economies time to try and negotiate and defuse the escalating [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=23.76s)]
*  trade war between them. The agreement came after US and Chinese officials met over the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=29.92s)]
*  weekend in Switzerland. Under the deal, the US will temporarily drop its tariffs from [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=34.7s)]
*  the 145% that President Trump ramped them up to down to 30. China will lower its tariffs [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=40.28s)]
*  from the 125% it retaliated with down to 10. Global markets have jumped at the news. The [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=47.36s)]
*  trade standoff had previously sent stocks tumbling and rocked businesses worldwide. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  This is a developing story this morning, and you can find more details at nytimes.com. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=59.28s)]
*  Bottom line, is it safe to fly in the United States right now? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=66.88s)]
*  Listen, we are the safest airspace for sure, and traveling by air is way safer than any [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=70.16s)]
*  other mode of transportation, which is why I take it, my family takes it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=76.04s)]
*  Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says flying in and out of Newark International Airport [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=80.16s)]
*  despite recent air traffic control outages and staffing shortages. But he said Americans [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=85.32s)]
*  should take the upheaval at one of the country's busiest airports as a sign of what's to come. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=90.88s)]
*  We have to fix this because what you see in Newark is going to happen in other places [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=97.08s)]
*  across the country. It has to be fixed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=101.32s)]
*  In an interview on NBC this weekend, Duffy called the recent issues, which have triggered [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  widespread delays and cancellations, the result of, quote, stress on an old network [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=108.46s)]
*  that could easily affect the whole country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=114.46s)]
*  Are there other airports that you are concerned about right now, Mr. Secretary? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  I'm concerned about the whole airspace. The equipment that we use, much of it we can't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=120.53999999999999s)]
*  buy parts for new. We have to go on eBay and buy parts if one part goes down. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=125.02s)]
*  Duffy said more U.S. airports could face disruptions and delays just as the busy summer travel [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=130.34s)]
*  season begins. He claimed the country and Congress have not paid enough attention to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=135.36s)]
*  the aging systems that underpin airport operations. The secretary recently put forward a proposal [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=140.8s)]
*  to modernize and overhaul the country's air traffic control systems. Duffy predicted the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=147.0s)]
*  project could take three or four years and didn't provide a cost estimate, except that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=152.28000000000003s)]
*  it would be in the billions of dollars. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  Last night, Hamas announced that it plans to release the last living American hostage [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=165.36s)]
*  it's holding in captivity. 21-year-old Eden Alexander is an Israeli American who was raised [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=173.36s)]
*  in New Jersey and went to Israel to join the military after high school. He was abducted [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=179.0s)]
*  from a military outpost, one of about 250 people who were taken hostage by Hamas on [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  October 7th. Hamas said Alexander could be set free as soon as today, and his parents [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  have traveled to Israel to be ready for their son's release. It's not clear what, if anything, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=194.68s)]
*  Hamas has demanded in exchange for his freedom. U.S. and Israeli officials said it was simply [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=199.96s)]
*  a gesture of goodwill toward the Trump administration. It could be an effort by the militant group [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  to curry favor with President Trump since it came just as he's headed to the region [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=210.88s)]
*  for his first major foreign trip this term. Today, Trump is starting a four-day swing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=215.56s)]
*  through Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Notably, he's not stopping in Israel. Recently, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=220.84s)]
*  some signs of division have started to show between him and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=227.72s)]
*  Now, two other updates on the Trump administration. Ahead of the president's visit to Qatar, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=234.84s)]
*  the Times has learned that he plans to accept one of the biggest foreign gifts ever given [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=240.72s)]
*  to the U.S. government, a luxury Boeing 747. The plane would be used as Air Force One before [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=245.44s)]
*  being donated to Trump's presidential library, potentially allowing him to use it for personal [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=252.64s)]
*  trips after he leaves office. The move has outraged Democratic lawmakers and alarmed [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=257.8s)]
*  ethics experts, with the head of one consumer watchdog group telling the Times that accepting [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=263.44s)]
*  the gift, quote, makes clear that U.S. foreign policy under Donald Trump is up for sale. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=268.44s)]
*  Trump suggested that the free plane would save taxpayers money, and he called people [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=275.04s)]
*  questioning the ethics of the gift, world-class losers. Also, today is the last day of bidding [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=279.36s)]
*  in a cryptocurrency auction promoted by President Trump that has raised more ethics concerns. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  The president announced last month that the top buyers of his family's crypto coin would [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=293.0s)]
*  get a private dinner with him and a tour of the White House. The contest has added billions [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  of dollars to the coin's value on paper, earned the Trump family over a million dollars in [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  trading fees, and raised questions about who's buying in. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=307.44s)]
*  By working with some crypto analytics experts, we were able to work out the identities behind [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=311.12s)]
*  some of these people. What's clear is that a lot of them are likely based overseas. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  My colleague David Yaffe-Bellany has been covering the Trump family's crypto ventures. He says [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=321.28s)]
*  that while non-citizens can't legally contribute to political campaigns, there's nothing stopping [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=326.2s)]
*  them from buying Trump coins to potentially try and influence the president's agenda. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=331.8s)]
*  You can see from public transaction records that they bought these coins on crypto exchanges, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=336.72s)]
*  which are a kind of marketplace that aren't open to U.S. users. So that was sort of the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  first clue. Then working with a company called Nonson, we were able to identify some of the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  actual individuals behind these purchases. One that stood out to us was an Australian [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  crypto entrepreneur named Kane Warwick. I spoke with him and he explained to me that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=357.84s)]
*  he wants to go to this dinner partly because it's an opportunity for him to speak with [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=362.28s)]
*  President Trump or people in Trump's inner circle and push them on crypto policy to make [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=366.64s)]
*  the case to them for why they should help crypto expand in the United States. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=372.34s)]
*  When pressed by reporters about potential ethics issues surrounding the crypto auction, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=378.84s)]
*  the White House rejected any criticism. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=383.54s)]
*  There are at least some people who are buying this coin who seem to view it as an opportunity [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=386.2s)]
*  to influence the president's views. If buyers are buying for that reason, are they wasting [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=389.56s)]
*  their money? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=392.88s)]
*  Look, I can assure you the president acts with only the interests of the American public [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=393.88s)]
*  in mind, putting our country first and doing what's best for our country, full stop. That's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=397.52s)]
*  his intention and that's what he's focused on. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=402.09999999999997s)]
*  India and Pakistan are now about a day and a half into a very fragile ceasefire. It appears [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=413.1s)]
*  to be holding despite some initial skirmishes across their borders. The truce between the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=417.70000000000005s)]
*  nuclear powers brought an end to four days of rapidly escalating drone attacks, shelling [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=422.90000000000003s)]
*  and airstrikes that left many civilians dead, wounded or displaced. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=428.1s)]
*  India and Pakistan have been arch enemies for 75, 80 years. But what we saw in the past [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  week was the most intense fighting we've seen almost in half a century. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=439.62s)]
*  My colleague, Majid Mashal is based in Delhi. He says the fighting between India and Pakistan, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=446.3s)]
*  which was set off by a terrorist attack in Kashmir, offered a preview of how much technology [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  has changed the stakes for the longtime adversaries. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=456.86s)]
*  It was for the first time that we saw huge use of drones where basically it was a massive [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=460.62s)]
*  escalation in the skies. Both sides were hitting targets in cities deep into each other's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=466.38s)]
*  country along the border, but there were no ground forces moved. And that signals the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=471.7s)]
*  future of what conflict in this part of the world will likely look like. It probably won't [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=477.34s)]
*  mean moving large number of ground forces into each other's border areas or tanks. It [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=485.34s)]
*  will mean massive infiltration of cheap drones that, you know, there isn't a huge political [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=492.41999999999996s)]
*  cost if you lose drones like that because they're not piloted. So what it does is because [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=498.46s)]
*  of how easy it is to use this new sort of age technology, it compresses the time of [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=505.26s)]
*  escalation. Things move so fast and it allows a lot of room for mistakes that could push [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=511.58s)]
*  things out of control. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=518.26s)]
*  Mujeeb says the two sides ultimately came to a ceasefire agreement under intense international [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  pressure. The United States stepped in, as did Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE, to try [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=528.26s)]
*  and cool tensions. India and Pakistan are expected to talk again today to discuss extending [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=533.94s)]
*  the truce. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=539.6600000000001s)]
*  And finally. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=546.46s)]
*  Steve, you have a very interesting property in Dalton, Illinois. A real estate listing [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=547.46s)]
*  for a three bedroom, two bath house south of Chicago went up a couple months ago. It's [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=553.6600000000001s)]
*  just a huge Chicago Cape Cod. The owner bought it last year for about $66,000 and redid the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=558.3000000000001s)]
*  whole thing. But then it sat on the market. We started it around $225. We did, you know, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=566.26s)]
*  a few price drops until last week when it came out. That little brick house for sale [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=572.34s)]
*  was the childhood home of the pope. Robert Francis Prevost, before he became Pope Leo, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=578.0600000000001s)]
*  was born and raised in Illinois, and his father owned the house until the 1990s. Once the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=584.38s)]
*  address was traced back to Leo, the first ever American pope, the offers started pouring [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=589.6600000000001s)]
*  in to the point it's now been pulled off the market while the owner tries to figure [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=595.02s)]
*  out what to do next. His real estate agent told a local radio station he isn't totally [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=598.98s)]
*  sure what the owner will do now. Field more offers, turn it into a museum. It's all up [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=603.5400000000001s)]
*  in the air. On the pope's part, his new accommodations at the Vatican are arguably an upgrade, depending [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSnjkaGTh0&t=607.94s)]
