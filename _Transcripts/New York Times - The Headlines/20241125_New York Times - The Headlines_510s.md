# The Trump Transition’s Secret Funding, and a Campus Crackdown
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, November [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=0.0s)]
*  25th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=7.28s)]
*  Donald Trump is continuing to race forward, making picks for his cabinet. In just the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=14.32s)]
*  past few days, he tapped the billionaire hedge fund manager, Scott Bessent, to serve as [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=19.16s)]
*  Treasury Secretary. He picked Brooke Rollins, a conservative lawyer and head of a pro-Trump [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=24.46s)]
*  think tank to run the Agriculture Department. And he named former pro football player and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=29.88s)]
*  Texas state representative Scott Turner to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=35.6s)]
*  My colleague David Sanger has been looking at all of Trump's choices and what their [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=41.6s)]
*  goals may be. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=45.96s)]
*  When I look across President-elect Trump's appointees, I see at least three different [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  factions. To start with, there's a revenge team led by nominees with instructions to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  rip apart the Justice Department, the intelligence agencies, parts of the Defense Department, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=59.5s)]
*  and basically to hunt down anyone who participated in the prosecution of Mr. Trump over the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=66.18s)]
*  past four years. Then there's a Comla Markets team, which Mr. Trump hopes very much will [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=71.9s)]
*  be led by Scott Bessent. He's got one big job. Make sure that the market surge that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=78.5s)]
*  followed President Trump's reelection continues. And also to make sure that Mr. Trump's more [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=85.34s)]
*  extreme ideas, including tariffs, don't trigger the kind of inflation that ended up being [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=92.78s)]
*  such trouble for President Biden. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  And then of course, there's a government shrinkage team. It's led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  They want to carve out what Mr. Musk says will be at least $2 trillion from the federal [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=111.14s)]
*  government. Now think about that figure for a minute, because the federal government's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=117.9s)]
*  entire budget is about $6.75 trillion. If you fired every federal employee so that you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=122.94s)]
*  could save money on their salaries, you wouldn't get halfway to the goal. So where do you think [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=130.7s)]
*  they're going to come up with this money is one of the great mysteries. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=136.66s)]
*  As Trump prepares to take office, he's keeping the names of the donors funding his transition [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=141.7s)]
*  effort secret. It's a break in tradition that set off alarm bells among ethics experts. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  Unlike past presidents elect, Trump has declined to sign an agreement that's designed to make [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=157.1s)]
*  the handover transparent. It would give Trump's transition team about $7 million in federal [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=162.42s)]
*  funds to pay for staff, office space and travel before they take over in January. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=167.78s)]
*  But it comes with strict limits on fundraising. Since Trump hasn't signed the agreement, he [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=172.86s)]
*  can raise unlimited amounts of money from donors, including from foreign nationals who can't [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=178.62s)]
*  give to campaigns but can give to the transition. None of the names have to be disclosed. So [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=183.98s)]
*  anyone trying to curry favor with Trump by donating can do so without having their name [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=190.22s)]
*  become public. Trump's team has repeatedly said they plan to sign the agreement, but they blew [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=194.38s)]
*  past deadlines to do so in September and October. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=200.18s)]
*  Over the weekend, Israel carried out widespread strikes in and around Beirut, including one in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=203.42s)]
*  the center of the city that killed 29 people, according to Lebanese officials. And the Israeli [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=215.5s)]
*  military is continuing to target the city's southern suburb of Dahya, which is effectively [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=221.06s)]
*  controlled by Hezbollah. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=225.98s)]
*  On this hillside that overlooks the area, people have started to gather nearly every [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=227.74s)]
*  night to watch the strikes rain down on the area. There are some local journalists who [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  are there to get their live shots, but there's also a lot of residents from Dahya who have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=237.34s)]
*  come to watch what's happening in their neighborhoods. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=242.3s)]
*  My colleague Christina Goldbaum is reporting from Lebanon. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=245.82s)]
*  Over the past couple of weeks, I've gone up to this hillside many times to talk to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=248.98s)]
*  people there and see what they're seeing. And just before there's an airstrike, you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=252.78s)]
*  typically hear this kind of thunderous roar of a warplane overhead. And then you can see [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  bits of smoke beginning to rise from wherever has just been hit. That usually becomes this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=262.26s)]
*  massive kind of cloud and plumes of smoke that rise up into the air. And when you're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=266.86s)]
*  on the hillside, you are around people who are discussing what might be hit, who are [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=272.09999999999997s)]
*  kind of pointing to these plumes of smoke to try to figure out what building it was, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=275.98s)]
*  which street is that, what neighborhood is that, to just have a better sense of what's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=280.22s)]
*  actually being destroyed in their neighborhood that right now is too dangerous for many people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  to go in and check in on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  Analysts say Israel's ramped up attacks over the last few days are intended to pressure [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=292.42s)]
*  Hezbollah into accepting a ceasefire deal. Hezbollah, however, has shown few signs of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=296.3s)]
*  backing down. Yesterday, the group launched one of its largest aerial attacks of the last [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=301.54s)]
*  year, firing about 250 projectiles into Israel. Both sides have said they will continue fighting [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  while the ceasefire negotiations are taking place. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=313.5s)]
*  At colleges and universities across the U.S., many administrators went into this school [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=323.38s)]
*  hoping to avoid a repeat of the last one, where pro-Palestinian protests and encampments [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=328.62s)]
*  rocked campuses. They've tightened rules against protests and handed down stricter punishments, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=334.44000000000005s)]
*  and it appears to be working as intended. In the spring, there were thousands of protests. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=340.98s)]
*  This fall, by one count, there were about 900. And while over 3,000 people were arrested [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=346.54s)]
*  in the spring, there have only been about 50 arrests this school year. Notably, the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=351.66s)]
*  tighter restrictions have led to crackdowns on even small-scale protests. Harvard temporarily [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=356.78s)]
*  banned dozens of students and faculty from the libraries after they sat silently at library [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=362.73999999999995s)]
*  tables with signs opposing the war in Gaza. And at Indiana University Bloomington, students [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=368.26s)]
*  at a candlelight vigil were referred for discipline under a new rule banning expressive activity [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=374.58s)]
*  after 11 p.m. Some Jewish students who felt targeted by last year's protests tell the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=380.34s)]
*  Times they appreciate the new rules. Other students say they feel the increased restrictions [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=386.61999999999995s)]
*  are about control and censorship. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  And finally, armchair detectives are taking on pandemic fraud. When the federal government [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=400.62s)]
*  distributed billions of dollars during the COVID-19 crisis, it did so in a giant rush [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=407.54s)]
*  with little oversight. It wanted to get money to people ASAP to keep businesses open and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=412.26s)]
*  keep people on the payroll. The whole thing was ripe for fraud, and there ended up being [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=417.86s)]
*  so much of that that federal investigators have struggled to look into it all. But under [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=422.94s)]
*  the False Claims Act, private citizens can file lawsuits against anyone who may have [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=427.86s)]
*  And if the government recovers any of the money, those private citizens typically get [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=434.18s)]
*  15 to 30 percent of it. The Times spoke with one lawyer in Oregon who helped the government [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=439.18s)]
*  claw back $3 million, earning $400,000 for himself along the way. He said he relied on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  information available on the internet to build his cases, combing through government websites, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=451.18s)]
*  Yelp pages, news articles, and LinkedIn profiles. Now there are signs that the big payouts are [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=456.42s)]
*  catching people's attention, potentially inspiring more people to do their own sleuthing, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=462.62s)]
*  whether they're skilled in the area or not. One former Justice Department official said [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=468.02s)]
*  that may not help the situation. The DOJ has to investigate every lawsuit to some extent, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=472.46s)]
*  so a new flood of citizen-led cases could strain government resources even more. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=479.08s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, Moscow bureau chief Anton Troianovsky on [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=488.08s)]
*  what he calls a dangerous new phase in Russia's war with Ukraine. That's next in the New [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i7BPyM3CI&t=503.64s)]
