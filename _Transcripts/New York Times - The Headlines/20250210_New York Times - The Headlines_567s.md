# Vance Challenges Courts’ Power, and Trump Targets the Penny
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Monday, February 10th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=6.36s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=7.76s)]
*  You know, we're flying over right now, we're flying over a thing called the Gulf of America. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  And I'm signing a proclamation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=20.8s)]
*  On Air Force One yesterday, President Trump made a flurry of announcements, including [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=22.88s)]
*  doubling down on his order renaming the Gulf of Mexico by declaring it Gulf of America Day. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=27.64s)]
*  And we're flying right over it right now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=33.36s)]
*  So we thought this would be appropriate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=36.04s)]
*  He was on his way to the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the first sitting president to attend the game. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  And from the plane, he also rolled out new tariffs that he said would go into effect today. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=44.08s)]
*  Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25 percent tariff. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  What about aluminum, sir? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Aluminum, too. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=56.36s)]
*  Trump said the sweeping new surcharges on foreign metals would apply to every country [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=57.56s)]
*  as he tries to bring back what was a booming American industry a century ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=62.88s)]
*  And he said he will announce more tariffs this week. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=67.52s)]
*  Very simply, if they charge us, we charge them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=70.56s)]
*  That's all. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=74.08s)]
*  When is it going to go into effect? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=74.56s)]
*  Almost immediately. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=76.32s)]
*  The new tariffs could draw more countries into Trump's trade fight and may encourage them [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=78.2s)]
*  to retaliate with their own tariffs against American-made goods. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=83.12s)]
*  Before Sunday was out, Trump also took aim at the penny. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=87.48s)]
*  He said last night that he's ordered the Treasury to stop minting the coins, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=91.84s)]
*  calling them a drag on the federal budget. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  It currently costs almost four cents to produce and distribute each one. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  And the U.S. Mint lost about $85 million making pennies last year. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=102.76s)]
*  A lot of other countries around the world have also gotten rid of their smallest coins because of the cost. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  But it's unclear if Trump can do this, since coin manufacturing doesn't fall under the president's powers. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=112.68s)]
*  Also this weekend, the Trump administration started dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  The bureau was created in 2011 in the wake of the financial crisis, and it was designed to be a watchdog. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=133.72s)]
*  It looks for predatory lending practices and junk fees and can penalize companies that take advantage of consumers. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=139.72s)]
*  But its work regulating big banks has put it squarely in the crosshairs of the administration, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=146.72s)]
*  in particular, Russell Vogt, who Trump put in charge of the agency on Friday. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=152.44s)]
*  Vogt has called the CFPB woke and weaponized, and by Sunday, he'd ordered its 1,700 employees to stop nearly all their work, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=157.8s)]
*  locked them out of the headquarters, and workers who tried to go get their laptops were turned away. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=167.36s)]
*  Only Congress has the power to completely eliminate the agency. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  And Senator Elizabeth Warren, who fought to create it in the first place, said, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, more than 40 lawsuits have now been filed in an attempt to stop Trump's efforts to reshape the federal government. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  And several federal judges have moved to block, at least temporarily, some of the administration's policies and actions. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=195.84s)]
*  But in a post on social media, Vice President J.D. Vance suggested the courts are overstepping by blocking Trump's policies, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=202.24s)]
*  comparing it to a judge telling a general how to carry out a military operation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=210.96s)]
*  Vance declared, quote, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=215.76s)]
*  Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=217.6s)]
*  That is really a challenge to most understandings of our constitutional system of government, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=221.68s)]
*  where it is the judiciary that gets to say what's legal and what isn't, what comports with the Constitution and what doesn't. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=227.4s)]
*  J.D. Vance is suggesting that he may have a very different reading of the Constitution. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  My colleague, Mattathias Schwartz, has been following the mounting legal cases against the Trump administration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=237.56s)]
*  One legal expert he spoke with said Vance's comments opened the door to a potentially dangerous path. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=243.16s)]
*  If the executive branch, the White House, decides it doesn't have to listen to the judicial branch, that could set off a constitutional crisis. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=249.12s)]
*  This whole scenario sounds like a thought experiment. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=257.56s)]
*  In many ways it is. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=260.52s)]
*  But we are starting to see some early indications that the Trump administration, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  They don't feel like they instantly have to change their behavior in order to comport with what a federal judge has told them to do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=267.12s)]
*  There's a case in Rhode Island right now where a judge has ordered them to unfreeze as much as $3 trillion of money that was going to the states, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=273.56s)]
*  the states needed for essential services. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  The judge said unfreeze the money. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=283.32s)]
*  And now a few days later, the states are alleging that significant amounts of that money are still frozen. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=285.64s)]
*  So we're going to see what the administration's posture really is going to be with the federal judiciary [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=291.2s)]
*  and whether they're going to respect orders or whether they're going to decide that because of how they view their own powers, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  they just don't have to listen to the courts at all. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=302.76s)]
*  In Gaza, nearly all Israeli troops have now withdrawn from the northern part of the territory. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=310.16s)]
*  And the military is now mostly just stationed along Gaza's outer borders with Israel and Egypt. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=315.6s)]
*  The drawback of Israeli forces will allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to continue returning to northern Gaza, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=321.36s)]
*  which they've been forced to evacuate early in the war. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=328.4s)]
*  They're passing through checkpoints staffed partly by American security contractors. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=331.44s)]
*  The withdrawal is part of the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=337.24s)]
*  As part of the agreement, three hostages were freed this weekend from Gaza. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=341.48s)]
*  The men looked so gaunt and frail that the Israeli foreign minister said they looked like Holocaust survivors. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=346.04s)]
*  The relatives of other hostages released in recent weeks say they rarely saw sunlight while in captivity and often went without food. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=352.88s)]
*  They said some of the hostages occasionally caught snippets of news on TVs or radios about their families campaigning to get them released. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=361.8s)]
*  And that helped them keep going. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  In California, The Times has been looking at how the crowdfunding site GoFundMe has become a crucial safety net for survivors of the wildfires. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=377.04s)]
*  The site says that donors have given more than $250 million to individuals and charities, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=386.04s)]
*  more money than GoFundMe collected for all natural disasters worldwide last year. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  Recipients said they were able to use the money immediately to pay for things like clothes and hotel rooms [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=397.56s)]
*  while they try and make lists of every single item they lost for insurance payments that could take months to be approved. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=403.76s)]
*  But critics point out that the surge in donations has also been good for GoFundMe itself. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=410.56s)]
*  The site charges an almost 3% fee on all donations, and by default, it asks donors to leave a tip, which goes directly to the company. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=416.24s)]
*  Overall, while the site has brought in a record-breaking amount of money, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=425.68s)]
*  the total cost of cleanup and recovery efforts after the fires is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=429.52s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  For the second time, the Vince Labardi Trophy is headed to Philadelphia. Eagles fly in Super Bowl 59. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  In New Orleans last night, the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs 40 to 22, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=451.56s)]
*  crushing the Chiefs' dream of winning three back-to-back Super Bowls. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=457.48s)]
*  But if you find yourself already missing the thrill of a run, the cheer of a crowd, the joy of an underdog win, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=462.04s)]
*  judging in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show begins in just a few hours. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=473.64000000000004s)]
*  2,500 meticulously groomed and carefully coiffed pups will be fighting for the most coveted [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=478.6s)]
*  Best in Show award. Looking at 117 years of the award's history, though, not all breeds stand a chance. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=484.84s)]
*  Wirefox Terriers, great posture, impressive facial hair, have won more than any other breed, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=493.0s)]
*  while one of America's most popular dogs, the oh-so-friendly Golden Retrievers, have never, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=499.4s)]
*  not ever, won Best in Show. When the chairwoman of the Judges' Education Committee at the Golden [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  Retriever Club of America was asked why, she got almost philosophical, saying, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=510.68s)]
*  It's one of those questions that can't be answered. That said, there are a few educated guesses. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=516.2s)]
*  Because Goldens are bred to be calm and steadfast, they might not catch the eye of Judges who reward [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=522.12s)]
*  faster, flashier movements in the ring instead. Also, the dogs are judged based on how closely [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  they match the platonic ideal of their breed, and Golden Retrievers have a wide variation in their [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=533.64s)]
*  size and color. They're not cookie cutter, like some other breeds. And it turns out there are no [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=539.0s)]
*  bonus points for being, oh my god, you're such a good boy, you're such a good boy, who's the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=544.44s)]
*  goodest boy, you're just the best boy I love. Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=548.84s)]
*  we'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj0LUTgA6Y4&t=558.6s)]
