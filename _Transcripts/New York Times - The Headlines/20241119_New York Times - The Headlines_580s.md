# Explosive Claims About Gaetz, and Dozens Jailed in Hong Kong Mass Trial
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, November [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=0.0s)]
*  19. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  For more than two years, the House Ethics Committee was investigating Florida Representative [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Matt Gaetz over claims of sexual misconduct, drug use, and other allegations. When he resigned [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=18.72s)]
*  from the House last week after being picked by Donald Trump or attorney general, the investigation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=25.14s)]
*  was shut down, and it seemed possible that the details of what they found would never [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=30.34s)]
*  be released. House Speaker Mike Johnson moved to block their report. Now, a lawyer representing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=34.82s)]
*  two women who were subpoenaed to testify in front of the committee is speaking out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=41.18s)]
*  She arrived at the party. She had sex with Representative Gaetz within minutes of her [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=45.5s)]
*  arrival. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=51.22s)]
*  Joel Leppard told multiple TV news programs last night that Gaetz paid his two clients [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=52.66s)]
*  for sex in 2017, soon after Gaetz took office. He said the women told the committee they [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=58.419999999999995s)]
*  were paid on Venmo. And Leppard said one of his clients also testified she saw Gaetz having [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=64.38s)]
*  sex with her underage friend, who was 17 at the time. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=70.86s)]
*  My clients didn't vote in the last two elections. They don't care one way or another. But they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=74.78s)]
*  do want the public to know that they are not lying. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=80.94s)]
*  Gaetz has previously denied the allegations, and a spokesman for the Trump transition team [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=83.5s)]
*  called them baseless, saying Gaetz was, quote, the right man for the job for attorney general. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=88.38s)]
*  Still, The Times has learned that in private conversations over the last few days, Trump [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=93.98s)]
*  admitted Gaetz may not get confirmed. Senators from both parties have expressed concerns [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=99.1s)]
*  about him. But picking someone as polarizing as Gaetz was part of Trump's plan. Basically, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=104.38s)]
*  a flood the zone approach. He's made so many controversial choices for his cabinet, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=110.74s)]
*  he's betting the Senate won't turn all of them down. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=116.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump used his social media platform to confirm how he plans to conduct the immigration [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=120.82s)]
*  crackdown he promised while campaigning. On Truth Social yesterday, he shared a post that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=130.82s)]
*  said his administration will declare a national emergency and use the military to carry out [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=136.74s)]
*  a mass deportation program. Trump added the word true in all caps with three exclamation [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=142.34s)]
*  points. Declaring a national emergency would give him the power to deploy troops inside [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=148.62s)]
*  the U.S. and to reallocate funding. Trump's top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, has [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=154.34s)]
*  said that part of the Pentagon budget will be used to build vast holding facilities to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  process migrants. Immigrant advocacy groups have rushed to condemn the plans, with one [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=165.1s)]
*  director at the group, Human Rights First, telling the Times, quote, families will be [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=171.01999999999998s)]
*  torn apart, businesses left without vital employees, and our country will be left to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  pick up the pieces for years to come. President Biden is asking Congress to approve [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=181.72s)]
*  almost $100 billion in aid to help communities across the U.S. recover from a series of devastating [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=194.3s)]
*  recent natural disasters. In a letter to Congress yesterday, Biden said the aid is urgently [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=201.18s)]
*  needed in places like Florida and the Carolinas that are struggling to recover from hurricanes [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  this fall, as well as Midwestern states still rebuilding after tornadoes last year. Congress [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  has not taken up Biden's other recent requests for disaster aid, but this one may get bipartisan [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  support because Congress is trying to tie up loose ends before the end of the year and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=223.58s)]
*  because much of the disaster aid would go to Republican districts. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  This morning, a court in Hong Kong handed down sentences for 45 former politicians and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  activists in what's being called a knockout blow to hopes for democracy in the city. They [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=243.74s)]
*  were arrested for participating in an unofficial primary election several years ago and charged [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=249.98s)]
*  under a national security law that Beijing has used to tighten its grip on the Chinese [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=255.42s)]
*  territory. So many people were on trial that the courthouse had to set up what it called [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  a mega courtroom to carry out the sentencing. The court handed down multi-year prison terms [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=264.9s)]
*  for many of the defendants, including veteran lawmakers and also young pro-democracy politicians. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=270.62s)]
*  But the court did not say that the trial was a stark reminder of how the Chinese government [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=277.98s)]
*  is unwilling to tolerate dissent of any kind and that criticizing Beijing carries significant [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=281.62s)]
*  risks. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=287.94s)]
*  I've been covering the war in Gaza for the last year and it's been this awful story of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=294.94s)]
*  people being killed, many people starving nearly to death, a struggle to get even the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=303.82s)]
*  most basic supplies in to the people who need it. But at the same time, people have started [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=310.62s)]
*  to create these little tiny pockets of normality just to feel like even amid all this death [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=317.54s)]
*  and destruction, they have a little bit of their normal lives. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=323.44s)]
*  Vivien Yee is part of the team covering Gaza for the Times and she says the town of Derabala [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=327.42s)]
*  in the center of the territory has become one of those tiny pockets. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=332.9s)]
*  One place where you see this is a street called Martyrs Street. It's the longest one in town [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=337.78s)]
*  and my colleague Bilal Shabir has reported on lots of businesses opening up there, including [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  shawarma places where you can get a sandwich or coffee shops and juice shops where you [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  can get avocado smoothies and orange juices freshly squeezed. And he says that lots of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=354.34s)]
*  people go and line up for dessert or go meet their friends for coffee and he says that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=361.58s)]
*  on parts of the street it kind of does feel oddly normal. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=370.18s)]
*  Obviously people in Derabala are not oblivious to what's happening elsewhere in Gaza. Everyone [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=378.34s)]
*  has friends or family living in much worse conditions and so some of the people we spoke [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=384.34s)]
*  to said there's definitely this sort of cognitive dissonance where they want to be able to focus [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=390.72s)]
*  on their own lives but they know other people are suffering terribly and there's a sense [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  of guilt for sure. We talked to one woman who said that when she is on the phone with [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=400.36s)]
*  her daughter in northern Gaza where things are much, much worse, she basically just lies [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=405.44000000000005s)]
*  to her about what she's eating because she feels so guilty that she's able to get all [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  this stuff while her daughter has almost nothing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=414.04s)]
*  The struggle to get supplies into Gaza was underscored this weekend when a large convoy [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=420.56s)]
*  of trucks was violently looted according to UNRWA, the UN agency that oversees aid to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=424.96s)]
*  Palestinians. A hundred and nine trucks crossed together into southern Gaza before gunmen [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  shot out the tires. Only 11 of the trucks made it to their destination. The agency said [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=436.08s)]
*  some of the drivers were injured in the attack and it's still waiting to hear about casualties. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=441.64s)]
*  It's not clear who was responsible but in much of Gaza there are no police officers [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=446.96s)]
*  and organized crime groups and armed gangs have stepped in to fill the vacuum. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  And finally, the man who encouraged millions of Americans to take that European vacation, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=465.67999999999995s)]
*  has died at 95. A trip to Europe has always been a luxury but it used to be the exclusive [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=472.68s)]
*  domain of the super wealthy until Fromer put out his guidebook in 1957 titled Europe on [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=479.08s)]
*  $5 a day. In it he insisted you didn't have to own an oil well to see London, Paris and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=486.24s)]
*  Rome and Americans jumped at the idea. The first copies sold out almost overnight and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=493.16s)]
*  Fromer's travel guides became the standard for budget-conscious tourism. One travel industry [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=499.28s)]
*  expert told the Times that Fromer basically single-handedly changed how Americans vacation [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=505.2s)]
*  by making Europe seem possible. Fromer, who developed his love of travel in the army, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  believed that thrifty travelers did it better than the rich. They learned more, they saw [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=517.3199999999999s)]
*  more and they interacted with more locals. He had a couple of rules in his early editions. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=521.68s)]
*  Never travel first class. He advised people to skip the propeller plane or the ocean liner [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=528.22s)]
*  and to consider traveling by freighter to Europe instead. He said you should pack lightly, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  take public transportation and in Venice in particular he said skip the gondolas. He warned [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=539.6600000000001s)]
*  in his first edition that they could cost as much as $3 an hour. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=545.4200000000001s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, how the people who pushed back during Trump's [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=553.74s)]
*  first term, the so-called resistance, are responding to his win this time. That's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=559.26s)]
*  next in the New York Times audio app or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=565.42s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Joa-P1DcnbY&t=569.5s)]
