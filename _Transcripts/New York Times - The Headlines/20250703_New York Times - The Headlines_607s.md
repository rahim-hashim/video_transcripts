# Final Vote on Trump's Bill, the Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs Verdict, Lululemon vs. Costco | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Thursday, July 3rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=7.92s)]
*  We must pass this bill to unleash economic growth and rural prosperity. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Let's make President Trump's one big, beautiful bill the law of the land. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=19.44s)]
*  At the Capitol, President Trump's marquee domestic policy bill, which will cement sweeping [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  tax cuts and slash federal safety net programs, is now facing the final hurdle. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=29.3s)]
*  We're securing our border in this bill, too. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=34.9s)]
*  We're opening up American energy in this bill. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=37.14s)]
*  After an all nighter, representatives are currently making their last ditch cases in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=39.38s)]
*  the chamber. I urge all my colleagues to oppose debt, death and hunger. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=44.300000000000004s)]
*  Oppose this cruel legislation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  A handful of GOP representatives could still defy their party over objections to the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=53.58s)]
*  bill and sink it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=58.74s)]
*  But the vote won't begin until the lawmakers have finished speaking. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=60.38s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries took the floor just before 5 a.m. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=64.22s)]
*  And because he's the Democratic leader, he has no time limit. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=67.42s)]
*  Not a single hardworking American taxpayer should ever have to choose between [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=70.98s)]
*  food or medicine or rent or put in clothing on their back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=77.18s)]
*  He's used the opportunity to share stories of people he says will be negatively impacted [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=81.54s)]
*  by the cuts in the bill. House Speaker Mike Johnson also plans to take the floor, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=85.94s)]
*  after which point things will likely move quickly to the vote. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=90.94s)]
*  For the latest, with analysis from my colleagues at the Capitol, go to NYTimes.com. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=94.3s)]
*  At the U.S.-Mexico border, illegal crossings have plunged to the lowest level in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=104.86s)]
*  decades. In June, immigration agents made just over six thousand arrests along the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=109.74s)]
*  border. It's a significant drop from the roughly fifty thousand people agents were [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=114.82s)]
*  arresting each month at the end of the Biden administration. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=119.38s)]
*  The decline seems to be a sign that President Trump's sweeping anti-immigrant policies [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  are working as intended, deterring people from trying to enter. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  The administration has aggressively ramped up arrests of migrants already in the U.S. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=131.54s)]
*  and deported people to detention centers in countries they're not from. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=136.62s)]
*  One border expert told the Times that people thinking about coming to the U.S. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=140.74s)]
*  are likely, quote, getting scary messages on WhatsApp, TikTok and elsewhere about how [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=144.9s)]
*  bad for migrants the climate is in the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=150.42s)]
*  Crucially, Trump also closed the door on America's longstanding policy of allowing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=154.1s)]
*  people who are fleeing violence or persecution to seek refuge. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=159.18s)]
*  On his first day in office, he signed an executive order blocking all asylum claims for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=163.18s)]
*  those crossing illegally. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=167.94000000000003s)]
*  Whether that policy can continue, however, is now in question. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=169.94000000000003s)]
*  Yesterday, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot categorically [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=173.82000000000002s)]
*  deny those claims since Congress had established those immigration policies. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=177.94000000000003s)]
*  Trump argued that he could usurp Congress's power because illegal crossings had become [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=182.86s)]
*  a, quote, invasion, a claim the judge rejected. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=187.78000000000003s)]
*  Under the order, the restrictive border policy will end in two weeks. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=191.9s)]
*  The administration has already filed an appeal and the case is likely to reach the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=196.1s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=199.98s)]
*  I'm Olivia Ben-Simone. I've been covering the Sean Combs trial for the Times and I was [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=205.3s)]
*  inside the courtroom on Wednesday when the verdict came in. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  In New York City yesterday, a jury reached its verdict in the case of hip hop mogul [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  Sean Combs after an eight week trial that had captured global attention. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=216.94s)]
*  When the first count came back not guilty, someone in the courtroom in the family row [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=221.70000000000002s)]
*  gasped and Combs looked back at his family and said, we're going to be OK. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=226.22s)]
*  And then the rest of the charges were read out, not guilty, guilty, not guilty, guilty. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=232.5s)]
*  And as they were going through, he was nodding to the jurors. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=238.42000000000002s)]
*  He was mouthing, thank you, thank you, thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=242.18s)]
*  And it seemed like he was praying. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=245.66s)]
*  The jury found Combs guilty of transporting prostitutes who had participated in the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=248.06s)]
*  days long drug fueled sexual encounters that were at the center of the case. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  But they found him not guilty of the most serious charges against him, sex trafficking [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=257.54s)]
*  and racketeering conspiracy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=262.62s)]
*  Combs had faced up to life in prison. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=264.74s)]
*  Now, the maximum he could get is 20 years and legal experts think he's likely to get [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=267.5s)]
*  less than that. The judge has yet to set a sentencing date, but he said that Combs must [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=272.02000000000004s)]
*  stay in prison for now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=277.14s)]
*  One of the key witnesses, Cassie Ventura, who testified that Combs abused her when [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=278.78s)]
*  they were dating, said he still poses a danger to her and others involved in the case. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=283.14s)]
*  Beyond this trial, Combs still faces dozens of lawsuits from other people who have [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=288.02s)]
*  accused him of abuse stretching back years. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=292.34s)]
*  He's denied those accusations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  For a deeper analysis of the trial and the mixed verdict, listen to today's episode of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=298.06s)]
*  The Daily. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=303.02s)]
*  In Russia, the harsh sanctions the U.S. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=307.14s)]
*  put in place after the invasion of Ukraine are beginning to lose their bite under President [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=312.38s)]
*  Trump's hands off approach. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  When the war began, the Biden administration started imposing sanction after sanction, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=319.14s)]
*  putting restrictions on banks, the oil trade, technology sales, etc. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=323.94s)]
*  in an attempt to cut Russia off from the world, cripple it financially and prevent it from [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=328.26s)]
*  getting the raw materials needed to produce more weapons. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  Those sanctions had mixed results, but for them to remain effective at all, experts say [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=336.54s)]
*  you need to keep issuing new ones to catch the shadowy back channel deals that pop up [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=341.62s)]
*  as workarounds. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  The Biden administration was putting on nearly 200 new sanctions every month. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=348.3s)]
*  Since Trump returned to office, though, the U.S. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=352.66s)]
*  has issued no new sanctions related to the invasion of Ukraine and in some cases has [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=355.38000000000005s)]
*  even eased restrictions on Russia. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=360.38000000000005s)]
*  The Times was able to identify more than 130 companies located in China now advertising [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=362.82s)]
*  sales of restricted computer chips to Russia. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=368.7s)]
*  None of them are under sanctions. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=371.82s)]
*  One of the companies is even offering the kind of chip essential to Russian cruise [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=373.85999999999996s)]
*  missiles, which Russia has been using in its intensified deadly attacks on Ukraine. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  And finally, fashion knockoffs have always been a thing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=383.38s)]
*  People walking around with channel purses instead of Chanel or Adidas sneakers with [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=386.62s)]
*  four stripes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=392.02s)]
*  But for Lululemon, the empire that yoga pants built, the duping has stretched too far. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=393.5s)]
*  Recently, the company filed a lawsuit against Costco, accusing it of selling ripoffs of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=399.98s)]
*  its activewear at a fraction of the price. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=404.98s)]
*  It's arguing Costco is a fraud. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=407.58s)]
*  It's arguing Costco sold items that not only looked a lot like Lululemon, but also [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=409.78s)]
*  used similar marketing terms. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=414.38s)]
*  For example, they both described blue colored sweatshirts that they were selling as [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=416.9s)]
*  tidewater teal. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  Costco didn't immediately respond to the Times's questions. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=423.7s)]
*  Experts say these kinds of lawsuits are notoriously difficult to win, partly because [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=427.05999999999995s)]
*  design trademark law is really lax in the U.S. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=432.02s)]
*  compared to some other markets. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=435.05999999999995s)]
*  But many companies are newly concerned about dupes because the Internet has gone all in [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=436.46000000000004s)]
*  on them. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=441.82s)]
*  Today, I'm going to rate some of the jeeps that I've tried in 2024. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  Influencers promoting the cheap version of brand name items that they swear are just [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=445.3s)]
*  as good are everywhere. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=449.98s)]
*  When I saw this, I knew I had to tell you. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=451.86s)]
*  These kinds of videos have billions of views. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=454.5s)]
*  It's basically life hacks for your shopping cart. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=457.18s)]
*  12.99. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=460.02000000000004s)]
*  They're the same. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=461.02000000000004s)]
*  Even down to the drawstring, the same. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=463.02s)]
*  One fashion law expert told the Times that while there used to be a stigma around wearing [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=466.02s)]
*  knockoffs, it's now lost a lot of that shame to the point that finding and rocking the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  affordable version, maybe even the Kirkland version, is now almost a point of pride. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=474.97999999999996s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=484.78s)]
*  The show will be back on Monday after the July 4th holiday. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=485.78s)]
*  That's the end of the show. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=488.97999999999996s)]
*  That means no Friday quiz this week, but we're going to throw you one question to tide you over. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=490.58s)]
*  This week, the WNBA announced big expansion plans, adding teams in three cities across [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=501.58s)]
*  the US as the league ramps up to meet a surge in demand from fans of women's basketball. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=507.65999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to give you a list of cities. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=512.5799999999999s)]
*  You have to guess which of these, could be more than one, is getting a team. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=514.66s)]
*  A. Cleveland. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=519.58s)]
*  B. Detroit. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=521.58s)]
*  C. Philadelphia. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=523.58s)]
*  D. San Francisco. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=525.58s)]
*  So again, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia, San Francisco. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=527.58s)]
*  The answer is... [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=535.58s)]
*  The first three, the WNBA said Cleveland, Detroit, and Philly will all get teams of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=537.58s)]
*  their own in the next few years. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=542.58s)]
*  San Francisco, that final option, actually just got a new team that started playing this [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=544.58s)]
*  year, the Golden State Valkyries. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=549.38s)]
*  It was the first new WNBA expansion team since 2008. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=552.38s)]
*  They actually let fans decide the team name. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=556.38s)]
*  We don't know if the other teams will do that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=559.38s)]
*  It's kind of a fun idea. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=560.38s)]
*  Valkyries was the top pick in a public poll. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=561.38s)]
*  Other options out there included the Sea Lions and the Fog, which would just have been a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=564.38s)]
*  lot harder to cheer for. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=572.38s)]
*  Like, go Fog! [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzqUQet3ue0&t=574.38s)]
