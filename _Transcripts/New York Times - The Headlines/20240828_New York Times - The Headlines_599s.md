# Federal Cases Against Trump Revived, and Israeli Forces Raid West Bank
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=4.84s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, August 28th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=5.84s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=8.44s)]
*  This week, both of the federal cases against Donald Trump, which have faced long delays [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  and legal setbacks, are back in play. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=19.16s)]
*  Monday, it was the classified documents case. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Special counsel Jack Smith filed an appeal to resurrect it, saying it never should have [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  been thrown out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=29.4s)]
*  Yesterday, it was the election interference case, in which Trump's accused of plotting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=30.68s)]
*  to overturn the 2020 election after he lost. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=35.44s)]
*  That case has basically been frozen for eight months while the courts considered whether [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=39.56s)]
*  former presidents can be prosecuted for actions they take in office. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=43.82s)]
*  The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Trump in July, granting former presidents [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=48.56s)]
*  broad immunity for official acts. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=53.92s)]
*  But what qualifies as official? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=57.2s)]
*  And does that cover all the actions Trump allegedly took? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=59.6s)]
*  Smith filed a revised indictment yesterday afternoon, essentially offering his answers [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  to those questions. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=68.0s)]
*  You saw Smith tweaking the indictment in very kind of small ways to suggest that Trump was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  not acting in his official role as president in this post-election period where he was [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=78.60000000000001s)]
*  seeking to remain in power, but in fact was acting in his private role as a candidate [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=84.72s)]
*  for office. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=91.64s)]
*  Times reporter Alan Feuer has been covering the cases against Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  He says Smith's updated indictment is largely similar to the original. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=96.84s)]
*  There's still allegations that Trump created fake slates of electors to claim victory, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=101.56s)]
*  and that he pressured Vice President Mike Pence to throw the election his way on January [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=106.84s)]
*  6th. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=111.52s)]
*  Some details have been removed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=112.92s)]
*  The biggest change that Jack Smith made to the January 6th indictment was stripping out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  any mention of the allegations concerning Trump's involvement in trying to get the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=122.2s)]
*  Justice Department to support his false claims that the election had been rigged against [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=128.28s)]
*  him. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=135.68s)]
*  And Smith took those allegations out of the new indictment because the Supreme Court, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=136.48s)]
*  in its ruling on immunity, specifically decided that when a president is having conversations [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  with officials in the Justice Department, that's part of his core official duties, and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=150.0s)]
*  so he can't face criminal charges related to them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=156.44s)]
*  Smith's revised indictment is basically his opening move for an upcoming courtroom battle [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  over whether the charges can stand. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=166.96s)]
*  We'll now be up to the trial judge to determine how the immunity ruling applies. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=169.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, the first rioter to breach the U.S. Capitol on January 6th was sentenced [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=176.96s)]
*  yesterday to four years in prison. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=182.36s)]
*  Michael Sparks, who's 47 years old and from Kentucky, was captured on video that day, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  entering through a window that rioters smashed with a police shield. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=190.28s)]
*  He'd posted on Facebook earlier, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=194.28s)]
*  The judge said it was undeniable that by going through the window first, Sparks encouraged [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=206.8s)]
*  others to follow. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=211.56s)]
*  He's the latest to be sentenced out of more than 1,300 people the Justice Department has [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=213.64s)]
*  charged in connection with January 6th. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=218.12s)]
*  In court yesterday, Sparks said he still believes the false claim that the 2020 election [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=220.92s)]
*  was, quote, completely taken from the American public. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=225.83999999999997s)]
*  In the West Bank, Israel carried out raids and airstrikes today, killing at least nine [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=235.44s)]
*  people according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=240.56s)]
*  The territory hasn't seen anywhere near the level of destruction that Gaza has, but this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=244.0s)]
*  This morning's operations seem to be a significant escalation of Israel's military campaign [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=248.76s)]
*  there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=253.84s)]
*  The strikes and raids appear to cover a wide part of the occupied territory, where nearly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=255.0s)]
*  3 million Palestinians and half a million Israeli settlers live. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=260.28s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority's official news agency says Israeli troops moved in on hospitals [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=265.12s)]
*  and were blocking access in and out of the towns of Jenin and Tulkarm. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=270.64s)]
*  The Israeli military said it was carrying out counterterrorism operations and did not [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=275.56s)]
*  provide more detail. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=279.84s)]
*  The country's foreign minister said, quote, we must deal with the threat just as we deal [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=281.72s)]
*  with the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=286.18s)]
*  The arrest of Pavel Durov, the founder of the messaging app Telegram, has rocked the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=296.52s)]
*  tech industry after he was taken into custody in France over the weekend. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=301.7s)]
*  French authorities have said it's part of an investigation into criminal activity on [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=306.26s)]
*  the app. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=310.26s)]
*  There is little precedent for a tech executive to be arrested for the things that their users [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=311.26s)]
*  say or do on the platform. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=316.78s)]
*  Adam Saturiano covers tech policy for the Times. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  He says that after Durov was arrested, the question immediately came up. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=323.14s)]
*  Should other tech executives like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk be worried about being arrested [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=327.64s)]
*  for what's on their platforms? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=332.76s)]
*  And really, you talk to many experts and the answer is no, that this is a fairly unique [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  set of circumstances here. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=339.8s)]
*  Telegram has been closely watched by law enforcement around the world for years on the platform, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=342.32s)]
*  which is approaching a billion users now. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  You can easily find illegal weapon sales, drug sales, terrorism propaganda. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=352.96s)]
*  There's corners that have child pornography. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  And law enforcement officials have long been frustrated that Telegram has not done enough [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=362.68s)]
*  to address this kind of material that spreads easily across its platform. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  But the case has become more than just about Telegram, which many people, particularly [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=372.64s)]
*  in the United States, have never heard of or used. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  It's become kind of a case study about the limits of free expression on the internet. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=380.88s)]
*  On the one hand, you have some more kind of free speech absolutists who believe that this [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=386.68s)]
*  is an example of government trying to censor what people say and do on the internet and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=394.48s)]
*  using the most punitive way possible to go after an executive to try and get them to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=400.68s)]
*  do something. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=405.64s)]
*  But others say that this is actually a much more narrow and legal argument about illegal [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=407.08s)]
*  activity happening on the platform and the company not doing anything to stop it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  French authorities have until today to formally charge Derov or release him. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon Church, has issued [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  a sweeping update to its policies that include new restrictions on the church's transgender [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=432.7s)]
*  members. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  People who pursue transition are now prohibited by the church from working with children, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  and trans people are barred from being baptized, even if they've only changed their names [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=445.06s)]
*  or pronouns. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=449.78s)]
*  The new guidance, which was rolled out last week, defines someone's gender as their [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=451.62s)]
*  biological sex at birth and says it's, quote, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=456.14s)]
*  In the past decade, the church, which has 17 million members, has carved out some limited [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=462.7s)]
*  acceptance for LGBTQ people, including no longer labeling same-sex couples as apostates, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=470.74s)]
*  people who've rejected their religion. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=477.74s)]
*  But it has also tightened rules around trans members, like restricting their access to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=479.94s)]
*  temples. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  A support group for current and former LGBTQ Mormons condemned the new guidelines, writing [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=485.65999999999997s)]
*  in a statement that they hope, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=492.38s)]
*  God will yet reveal better for our transgender siblings. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=493.90000000000003s)]
*  And finally, the Orcas are back. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=497.90000000000003s)]
*  For the past few years, sailors off the coast of Spain and North Africa have been on the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=505.78000000000003s)]
*  lookout for pods of Orcas, which have attacked ships, leaving them stranded at sea or even [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=509.6s)]
*  sinking them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=514.94s)]
*  This week, Orcas rammed another sailboat, breaking its rudder and forcing its crew to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  put out a Mayday call. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=521.18s)]
*  No one knows exactly why the Orcas in that part of the ocean are going after ships. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=523.26s)]
*  One theory is that they're reacting to past traumatic encounters with boats. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=527.96s)]
*  Another is that they're just naturally curious and playful mammals who are just maybe getting [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=532.54s)]
*  a little carried away. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=536.5s)]
*  But a team of Spanish researchers has a new theory that's based on one of the Orcas' [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=538.5s)]
*  favorite snacks, Atlantic bluefin tuna. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=543.18s)]
*  The scientists say that the tuna, which are fast swimmers and can be 10 feet long, are [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=547.0999999999999s)]
*  hard to catch. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=551.2199999999999s)]
*  So the Orcas need something to train on. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdiF1eO2lys&t=552.66s)]
