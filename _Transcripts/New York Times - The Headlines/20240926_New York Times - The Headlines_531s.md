# Eric Adams Is Indicted, and Florida Braces for Hurricane Helene
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=4.24s)]
*  Today's Thursday, September 26th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=7.92s)]
*  My fellow New Yorkers, it is now my belief that the federal government intends to charge [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  me with crimes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=20.32s)]
*  If so, these charges will be entirely false based on lies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=22.92s)]
*  The Times has learned that New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted as part of a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=29.6s)]
*  federal corruption investigation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=34.08s)]
*  As of early this morning, the indictment has not been made public, and it's unclear what [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=36.56s)]
*  exactly Adams is charged with. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=40.64s)]
*  But investigators have been focused, in part, on whether he and his campaign conspired with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=42.92s)]
*  the Turkish government to get illegal foreign donations. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=47.72s)]
*  For months, leaks and rumors have been aimed at me in an attempt to undermine my credibility [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=51.24s)]
*  and paint me as guilty. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=58.08s)]
*  Even before he was indicted, Adams released a defiant video statement, preemptively denying [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=60.08s)]
*  any allegations. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=65.0s)]
*  I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=66.28s)]
*  If I'm charged, I know I am innocent. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=72.8s)]
*  This is the mayor of America's largest city, and he is the first mayor of modern New York [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=76.24s)]
*  to be indicted on criminal charges. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=81.52s)]
*  It's an historic event. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  News reporter Dana Rubenstein is part of the team that broke the news of the indictment. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=86.6s)]
*  So this is the culmination of an investigation that has looked into all sorts of things, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  including potentially illegal donations to his campaigns from foreign donors, as well [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=96.08s)]
*  as the possibility that he tried to influence the city to approve a new high-rise Turkish [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=102.0s)]
*  consulate in Manhattan, despite safety concerns. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=109.56s)]
*  It's also looked into the possibility that he received free airline upgrades on Turkish [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=114.06s)]
*  airlines, and it's one of four investigations that are looking at him and the people in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=118.94s)]
*  his orbit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=123.3s)]
*  Federal prosecutors are expected to announce details of the indictment later today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=125.22s)]
*  It's not yet clear when Adams will surrender to authorities. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=129.8s)]
*  In the meantime, a number of state senators, city council members, and other local politicians [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=133.54s)]
*  have already called for him to step down. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=138.5s)]
*  The indictment comes as the city government has been engulfed in a chaotic series of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=141.02s)]
*  scandals and resignations that have stretched beyond the case involving Turkey. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=145.38000000000002s)]
*  In just the past few weeks, the city's police commissioner and the mayor's legal advisor [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=150.02s)]
*  have both resigned, and two former fire chiefs have been arrested on bribery charges. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=154.18s)]
*  Unfortunately, we've got a lot of information to pass on to you with this update, and some [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=163.34s)]
*  of it is increasingly dire for the people in the path of this storm. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=167.54s)]
*  Almost every county in Florida is now under a state of emergency as Hurricane Helene plows [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=173.64s)]
*  through the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=178.82s)]
*  The giant storm is currently a Category 1, but it's expected to strengthen and could [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=180.72s)]
*  reach Category 4 by the time it makes landfall this evening south of Tallahassee. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=185.1s)]
*  Now, I've been here for 25 years. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=189.89999999999998s)]
*  We don't normally forecast surge values this big, so this is pretty significant. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  Officials at the National Hurricane Center are warning residents to prepare for up to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=197.36s)]
*  18 feet of storm surge, along with damaging winds. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  After Helene comes ashore, it's forecast to push north through Georgia and Alabama up [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=204.84s)]
*  to the Carolinas, bringing heavy rain to the entire region in the coming days. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=209.44000000000003s)]
*  You can follow live coverage of the storm at nytimes.com or on the New York Times app. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  The American economy is the most powerful force for innovation and wealth creation in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=219.16s)]
*  human history. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=232.68s)]
*  In Pittsburgh yesterday, Kamala Harris gave a major economic policy speech in an effort [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=234.28s)]
*  to win over voters who are worried about the economy, but who aren't sure about what a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=239.34s)]
*  Harris administration would do to help. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=243.6s)]
*  I believe an active partnership between government and the private sector is one of the most [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  effective ways to fully unlock economic opportunity. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=253.32s)]
*  The point of Vice President Harris's speech on Wednesday was less about giving us new [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=260.0s)]
*  details and new ideas about what she's for on economic policy and more about telling [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=264.52s)]
*  us what she's not, which is a socialist. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=270.04s)]
*  Jim Tankersley covers economic policy for the Times. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=273.56s)]
*  He says that while Harris did touch on some tangible proposals, like tax breaks for startups [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=276.68s)]
*  and a plan to incentivize contractors to build more housing, she was also playing a bit of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=281.56s)]
*  defense. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=286.6s)]
*  Polls show that Donald Trump's attacks on her economic beliefs, including calling her [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=287.6s)]
*  a socialist and a communist, have raised doubts in some voters' minds. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=291.76s)]
*  Look, I'm a capitalist. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=295.8s)]
*  I believe in free and fair markets. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=298.4s)]
*  She went out of her way to say, I'm a capitalist, which is something she said before, but took [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=302.4s)]
*  on extra importance in this speech when Harris went on to talk about, in very technical terms, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  all of the ways that she sees the government being this force of pragmatic experimentation [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  to help business to invest more, to do good things in the economy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=318.28s)]
*  She needs to convince voters that she's a safe choice, that she can manage the economy [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=322.29999999999995s)]
*  well. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=326.88s)]
*  And in particular, she needs to persuade voters who are skeptical of government, who [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=327.88s)]
*  are just not sure that it has all the answers to their economic problems, but want to see [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=331.64s)]
*  it used more effectively to bring down costs and make their lives better. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=335.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, many members of Congress have left Washington and are back home for the final [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=345.28s)]
*  weeks of their own campaigns. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=350.0s)]
*  Last night, Congress passed its last bill before the election, a budget extension that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=352.4s)]
*  keeps the government funded through mid-December, narrowly avoiding a shutdown that was just [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=356.68s)]
*  days away. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=361.0s)]
*  This term, the GOP-led House, with its slim majority, struggled to get almost any significant [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=362.68s)]
*  legislation passed, and House Republicans didn't follow through on some campaign promises [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=367.8s)]
*  like impeaching President Biden. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=372.52s)]
*  So I was speaking to Republican members about what accomplishments they're going to point [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=374.72s)]
*  to in the coming weeks when they go home to their districts. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=378.28s)]
*  And a lot of them don't really know what to say. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=382.28s)]
*  Annie Carney covers Congress for the Times. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=384.92s)]
*  I talked to Maria Salazar. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=387.16s)]
*  She's a vulnerable Republican from Florida yesterday. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=389.24s)]
*  And she told me to wait for her as she went into the chamber to vote and told me she would [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=392.72s)]
*  like to have a conversation with me about what should be a pretty easy question for [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=397.2s)]
*  a lawmaker. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=400.8s)]
*  The question I asked her was, what is your message to voters about what Republicans have [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=401.8s)]
*  achieved over the past two years? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=405.88s)]
*  I mean, that's not a gotcha. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=407.48s)]
*  And then she came out and hustled into her car and said, I really have to go to a fundraiser. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't have time to give this my full attention, but we will get back to you with a fulsome [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=414.48s)]
*  response. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=420.12s)]
*  And she made her aide get my cell phone number and promise that they were really going to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=421.36s)]
*  give me something and no one ever got in touch. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  Annie says the question to watch is whether voters in Florida and beyond care about how [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  dysfunctional Congress has been recently, but that in a polarized moment in American [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=435.0s)]
*  politics, it's likely that many people will simply stick with their party. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  And finally, we may be living through the beginning of the end of the Super Size Me [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=444.48s)]
*  era. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  A survey out this year from the National Restaurant Association shows that 75% of Americans say [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=454.56s)]
*  they want smaller portions and a number of restaurants are listening. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=460.04s)]
*  Subway recently introduced a snack focused menu, including little $3 wraps. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=464.36s)]
*  Some Burger Kings are now selling eight chicken nuggets instead of 10 piece orders. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=469.12s)]
*  And a group of researchers at Georgetown University want to reduce portion sizes at [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=473.44s)]
*  major chains like Panda Express and Chick-fil-A. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=477.9s)]
*  Food prices are the main reason consumers and restaurants want to shrink portions. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=481.48s)]
*  There's also the issue of food waste. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=486.12s)]
*  As much as 40% of food served at restaurants never gets eaten. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=487.96s)]
*  Eating trends have also changed. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  Adults say they now eat about half their meals a day in the form of snacks. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=494.12s)]
*  What experts have creatively labeled snackification. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=498.44s)]
*  And millions of Americans are now taking weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wigovie [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=502.4s)]
*  that suppress their appetites. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=507.06s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=511.28s)]
*  Today on The Daily, why one of the largest psychiatric hospital chains in the US is holding [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=512.28s)]
*  patients against their will. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=517.6s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=520.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=524.36s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bwsXHbj7Es&t=525.84s)]
