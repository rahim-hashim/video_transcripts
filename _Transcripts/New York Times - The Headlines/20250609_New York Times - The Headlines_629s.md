# Trump Deploys National Guard in LA, YouTube Moderation Changes, Big Tony Winners | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Michael Simon Johnson in for Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=0.0s)]
*  Today's Monday, June 9th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=8.0s)]
*  My name is Livia. I am a reporter with the New York Times. I'm based in Los Angeles and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=13.0s)]
*  I'm here at the protests. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=25.0s)]
*  My colleague Livia Albeck-Ripka and others have been on the ground in Los Angeles. For [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=26.7s)]
*  days, federal authorities and local police there have clashed with demonstrators over [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=31.7s)]
*  the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=36.34s)]
*  The authorities have been firing crowd control munitions into the crowd, tear gas. The protest [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=41.7s)]
*  just keeps growing and people are chanting. They're holding Mexican flags and we're just [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=48.7s)]
*  waiting to see what happens next. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=55.7s)]
*  Authorities say they've arrested hundreds of migrants in the LA region in the past few [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=57.7s)]
*  days. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, says many of those arrested have criminal [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=62.7s)]
*  backgrounds. The clashes between protesters and authorities kicked off on Friday when ICE [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=67.7s)]
*  officers began combing through Los Angeles' Garment District searching for undocumented [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=72.7s)]
*  immigrants. And as word of the raids spread, protesters gathered and demonstrations expanded [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=77.7s)]
*  to nearby cities. Some protesters threw eggs, rocks and scooters and aimed fireworks at [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=82.7s)]
*  immigration officers who responded with pepper spray, flash grenades and foam projectiles. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=88.7s)]
*  We're not going to let this happen to our country. We're not going to let our country [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=93.7s)]
*  be torn apart like it was under fight. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=97.7s)]
*  In response to the protests, President Trump started to deploy National Guard troops. He [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=100.7s)]
*  said he would deploy 2,000 of them. By Sunday, nearly 300 members of the National Guard were [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=105.7s)]
*  in the area and 500 Marines were put on standby. The move to send in federal troops essentially [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=111.7s)]
*  bypassed the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom and relied on a rarely used law [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=117.7s)]
*  meant for quelling rebellion against the U.S. government. On Sunday, Newsom pushed back, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=123.7s)]
*  calling the move a breach of state sovereignty and demanding that Trump pull the troops off [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=128.7s)]
*  the streets. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=133.7s)]
*  This confrontation between a sitting governor and a sitting president is extraordinary. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=134.7s)]
*  Adam Nagourney covers national politics and is based in California. He says it's the first [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=139.7s)]
*  time a president has activated a state's National Guard without a request from that [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=144.7s)]
*  governor since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to Alabama to protect [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=149.7s)]
*  civil rights protesters. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=155.7s)]
*  Not only did Gavin Newsom formally call on the White House to rescind the order, he accused [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=158.7s)]
*  Trump of taking actions designed to cause strife and stir up tensions and set off more [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=163.7s)]
*  of the protests that we've seen on the streets of Los Angeles. As long as these demonstrations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=168.7s)]
*  are going on, it's hard to imagine either man backing down. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=173.7s)]
*  Now, two more quick updates from the Trump administration. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=186.7s)]
*  First, President Trump's new travel ban went into effect this morning. The ban was first [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=191.7s)]
*  announced last week, and it keeps citizens from 12 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=196.7s)]
*  East, from entering the U.S. There's also visa restrictions for seven other countries, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=201.7s)]
*  including Cuba and Venezuela. There are exceptions for people who have existing visas or green [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=206.7s)]
*  cards, but those immigrants who are already in the U.S. have growing concerns about traveling [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=212.7s)]
*  out of the country, and many families are bracing for extended time apart as travel and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=217.7s)]
*  reunion plans are upended. Some governments have lashed out over the decision, with one [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=223.7s)]
*  Venezuelan official calling the Trump administration, quote, fascist. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=228.7s)]
*  And... [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=233.7s)]
*  Abrego Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=234.7s)]
*  After months of saying that the U.S. was incapable of returning him to U.S. soil, Attorney General [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=239.7s)]
*  Pam Bondi announced on Friday that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the man who had been [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=245.7s)]
*  wrongfully deported to El Salvador back in March, is now back in the U.S. to face criminal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=250.7s)]
*  charges. He's been formally charged with smuggling migrants as part of the street gang [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=255.7s)]
*  MS-13. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of 10 years for each person he allegedly [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=260.7s)]
*  transported. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=267.7s)]
*  This is what American justice looks like. Upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=268.7s)]
*  he will be returned to his home country of El Salvador. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=274.7s)]
*  The administration could still face contempt proceedings for its initial refusal to return [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=278.7s)]
*  Abrego Garcia despite a court order, and Abrego Garcia's lawyers are pushing for the judge [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=283.7s)]
*  to continue those proceedings. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=288.7s)]
*  The Times has learned that YouTube has quietly changed how it moderates content on its platform [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=295.7s)]
*  in the wake of the Trump presidency. After years of removing videos that violated its [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=301.7s)]
*  rules against misinformation and derogatory language, YouTube is now encouraging content [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=306.7s)]
*  moderators to leave those videos up if they are in the public interest. That includes [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=311.7s)]
*  content that focuses on topics like race, sexuality, abortion, immigration, and censorship. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=317.7s)]
*  YouTube didn't make this announcement publicly. We learned about it by reviewing materials [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=323.7s)]
*  that were shared with content moderators in mid-December as they began to train content [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=328.7s)]
*  moderators about what should stay on YouTube and what should be pulled off. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=334.7s)]
*  My colleague Tripp Mickle covers technology for the Times. He says YouTube is following [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=339.7s)]
*  in the footsteps of other social media companies like X and Meta, which have loosened their [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=344.7s)]
*  content moderation rules. The new policy is more lenient to content that is considered [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=349.7s)]
*  educational or has artistic merit. Before, if just a quarter of a video had violated the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=354.7s)]
*  rules, it was removed. Now, up to half of the content can violate YouTube's policy [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=360.7s)]
*  and remain online. In the course of these training materials, they also provided some [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=365.7s)]
*  examples of what this would look like for content moderators. And one of the videos [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=370.7s)]
*  they talked about was one titled, RFK Jr. Delivers Sledgehammer Blows to Gene-Altering [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=375.7s)]
*  Jabs, which of course is a reference to vaccines. In the past, this kind of video would have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=383.7s)]
*  violated YouTube's policy against medical misinformation by incorrectly saying that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=391.7s)]
*  COVID vaccines could alter people's genes. But in the future, under this new policy, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=396.7s)]
*  the training material said that the video shouldn't be removed because it was newsworthy, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=403.7s)]
*  because it was about RFK, the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary. And [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=409.7s)]
*  it also mentioned other political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=416.7s)]
*  and Megyn Kelly, which boosted its quote unquote newsworthiness. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=422.7s)]
*  Tripp says the Times asked YouTube about the changes. The company said they'd only impact [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=429.7s)]
*  a small number of videos, that it retires policies that no longer make any sense, like [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=434.7s)]
*  on COVID, and that their main goal is to protect freedom of expression while mitigating [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=439.7s)]
*  harm. But critics say YouTube's reputation as a largely legitimate source of information [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=444.7s)]
*  is exactly why the platform should be more rigorous with content moderation. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=449.7s)]
*  Unlike Meta, which has a lot of content that's just written by people and goes directly up, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=454.7s)]
*  YouTube videos tend to be more time consuming. They're more thoughtful. They're also put up [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=461.7s)]
*  on a platform that has a fairly prestigious brand reputation, one that is kind of validating [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=466.7s)]
*  because people go there for how to videos on everything from like how to hang a curtain [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=473.7s)]
*  rod to how to do yoga. And so when you mix potentially inflammatory videos alongside [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=479.7s)]
*  those kind of like established and well regarded videos, the inflammatory videos could have [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=486.7s)]
*  more standing in the eyes of a viewer. And that's something that critics are a little bit concerned about [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=492.7s)]
*  with this change. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=497.7s)]
*  And finally, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=502.7s)]
*  the Tony Awards were last night, capping off a banger season for Broadway. It was the highest [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=509.7s)]
*  grossing year on record, not adjusted for inflation, with celebrity driven productions like George [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=515.7s)]
*  Clooney's Good Night and Good Luck and Denzel Washington's Othello breaking box office records [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=521.7s)]
*  with their eye popping and wallet gouging ticket prices. But many of those famous faces went home [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=526.7s)]
*  last night empty handed, or in the case of Denzel, didn't even get nominated. Here are some of the big [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=532.7s)]
*  winners of the night. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=538.7s)]
*  Maybe Happy Ending, which explores love and relationships through futuristic robots, one best new musical. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=545.7s)]
*  We taught the world new ways to dream. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=552.7s)]
*  Sunset Boulevard won Best Musical Revival, and its star, pop singer Nicole Scherzinger, took home a Tony of her own. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=563.7s)]
*  And Cole Escola beat out George Clooney for Best Actor in a Play, playing an exaggerated version of Abe Lincoln's [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=570.7s)]
*  wife, Mary Todd. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=577.7s)]
*  In my version, Mary is a frustrated, alcoholic cabaret performer. It's that classic tale of art imitating life. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=579.7s)]
*  My life, not hers. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=586.7s)]
*  Escola says they spent more than a decade working on the play, tinkering with the idea and, quote, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=590.7s)]
*  painstakingly avoiding any research. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=595.7s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, a look at Trump's critical decisions over the past few days involving the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=600.7s)]
*  protests in Los Angeles and his very public fight with Elon Musk. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=607.7s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=613.7s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. I'll be here for the next two weeks and we'll be back tomorrow. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ol86HnMUvI&t=617.7s)]
