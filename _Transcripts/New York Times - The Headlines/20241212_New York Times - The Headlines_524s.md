# F.B.I. Chief to Step Out of ‘the Fray,’ and Housing’s Terrible Year
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=4.8s)]
*  Today's Thursday, December 12th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=5.8s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=7.8s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump is one step closer to achieving his vision for the FBI. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  The current FBI director, Christopher Wray, announced that he's going to end his term [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=20.28s)]
*  early, effectively stepping out of Trump's way. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=24.48s)]
*  After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=28.2s)]
*  serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=33.6s)]
*  Wray made the announcement yesterday in brief remarks to a packed conference room of FBI [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=39.4s)]
*  employees. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=44.32s)]
*  This is not easy for me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=45.32s)]
*  I love our mission and I love our people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=47.92s)]
*  My focus is and always has been on us and on doing what's right for the FBI. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=51.76s)]
*  His decision wasn't unexpected. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=58.8s)]
*  Trump was the one who appointed Wray originally in his first term, but quickly soured on him [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=60.92s)]
*  and has made clear he wants Wray out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=65.44s)]
*  Trump has railed against him, especially after the FBI searched Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=68.4s)]
*  for classified documents in 2022. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  In a speech yesterday, Wray tacitly acknowledged that the agencies become a political target [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=76.08s)]
*  saying he's stepping down early to quote, avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=82.12s)]
*  Trump has already said he intends to nominate Cash Patel to fill the role, someone who's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=87.88s)]
*  vowed to wreak vengeance on the FBI for investigating Trump. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=92.84s)]
*  Patel's also promised to fire FBI leadership and shut down the Bureau's DC headquarters. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=96.84s)]
*  He may still face a contentious confirmation process in the Senate, but Patel was confident [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=102.92s)]
*  yesterday when asked about Wray's resignation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=107.88s)]
*  We look forward to a very smooth transition at the FBI and I'll be ready to go on day one. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=110.52s)]
*  Ahead of Trump's inauguration, a number of U.S. colleges are warning their international [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=117.32s)]
*  students to make sure they're back on campus before he takes office. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=122.32s)]
*  Otherwise, they could find themselves unable to get back at all. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=126.56s)]
*  During Trump's last term, he put travel bans in place for people entering the U.S. from [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=130.84s)]
*  some majority Muslim countries. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=135.2s)]
*  That caught many students who were overseas at the time by surprise. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=137.84s)]
*  Thousands were stranded. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=141.8s)]
*  Now, Trump has talked about wanting to bring back some of those travel restrictions, and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=142.8s)]
*  they could kick in when students are still wrapping up their winter breaks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=147.52s)]
*  The school's warnings are all just precautionary at this point, but Cornell University notified [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=151.28s)]
*  its students that additional countries could also be affected, particularly China and India. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=156.56s)]
*  Students from those two countries alone make up more than half of international students [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=162.9s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=166.94s)]
*  President Biden is commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 people today, the most ever [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=173.18s)]
*  in a single day by an American president. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=178.62s)]
*  In a statement, the White House said that those who will have their sentences cut short [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=181.64s)]
*  had already been released from prison into home confinement during the pandemic in order [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=185.54s)]
*  to deal with overcrowding, and that they've since reintegrated into their communities. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  The White House said Biden will also grant full pardons to 39 people who were convicted [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=195.74s)]
*  of a range of nonviolent offenses. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=200.72s)]
*  Biden's clemency choices have been under intense scrutiny since he pardoned his own [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  son earlier this month. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=207.94s)]
*  The White House says there may be more pardons to come in the final weeks of his presidency. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=210.3s)]
*  I look on Zillow every single day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=223.04s)]
*  I think maybe one or two houses in my range have shown up in the last month or so. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=225.44s)]
*  The 2024 housing market is about to close out with the fewest number of home sales in [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  almost 30 years. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=237.16s)]
*  The first one that we put an offer on, I think it was 38 different offers besides ours. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=239.04s)]
*  It went like 25-ish percent over list, over asked. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=244.73999999999998s)]
*  Real estate buyers have been struggling to find any properties, and they're facing prices [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=249.64s)]
*  that just keep rising. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=253.32s)]
*  Times real estate reporter Rhonda Cason's been talking with buyers, or those trying [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=259.56s)]
*  to buy, all year. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=263.68s)]
*  She says the country's basically frozen in place. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  Americans aren't able to move. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  Part of it is mortgage rates. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=271.44s)]
*  They've stayed stubbornly high, pricing some people out of the market and making some owners [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=273.36s)]
*  feel like they can't sell because they'd have to give up a lower rate on their current [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=278.48s)]
*  house. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=282.72s)]
*  But a bigger issue is supply. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=283.88s)]
*  The U.S. has not built enough new homes to keep up with a growing population. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  The real estate listing site Zillow estimates there's a shortage of about 4.5 million homes, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  and economists are skeptical that there will be enough new construction to ease the problem [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  any time soon. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=302.88s)]
*  In Sudan, a vicious fight for power between two rival generals has left the country in [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=311.04s)]
*  a humanitarian crisis. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=316.28s)]
*  Tens of thousands have been killed in the civil war, and more than 25 million people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  are facing acute hunger or starvation. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=323.12s)]
*  The Times has been tracking how one precious resource is fueling the conflict. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=326.32s)]
*  The warring parties are actually on both sides of the front line, doubling down on gold. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=331.4s)]
*  My colleague Declan Walsh says there's a wartime gold rush happening, with more mining and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  trading now than before the violence broke out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=342.47999999999996s)]
*  Billions of dollars of gold are on the move. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=345.84s)]
*  On social media, you see these images of fighters showing off with gold bars or gold jewelry [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=348.67999999999995s)]
*  that they've looted from people's homes or from banks, flashing it for the cameras, boasting [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=355.28s)]
*  of what they've looted. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=360.64s)]
*  But it also, for the commanders on both sides, is an invaluable asset that pays for drones, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  for guns, for other weapons that are perpetuating this conflict. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=369.2s)]
*  And not only that, as gold prices have touched historic highs just in the last 12 months, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=374.24s)]
*  that has provided a further incentive for the foreign powers which are meddling in this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=380.0s)]
*  war to get even more involved. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=385.3s)]
*  Countries like Russia and the United Arab Emirates, our reporting has shown, are involved [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=388.68s)]
*  in gold mining across the country, trying to get their own piece of these riches and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  potentially prolonging the consequences of this horrific war. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=398.48s)]
*  And finally... [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=410.76s)]
*  We're on Love is Blind, to love we may find. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=411.76s)]
*  At the altar, we'll decide, and if we like the same girl, back off, she's mine. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=415.68s)]
*  The show Love is Blind, in which people date without ever seeing each other, has been a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=422.08s)]
*  massive hit for Netflix. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=426.8s)]
*  It's going into its eighth season. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=429.12s)]
*  But how the contestants are treated has now come under scrutiny from the National Labor [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=431.54s)]
*  Relations Board. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=435.8s)]
*  A regional branch of the board started an investigation after two people on the show [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=437.36s)]
*  raised concerns about the contracts they had to sign. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=441.52s)]
*  Yesterday, the board announced that it had found the show committed multiple labor violations, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=445.12s)]
*  including threatening anyone who leaves the show early with a potential $50,000 fine. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=451.08s)]
*  The board also demanded that the show reclassify the participants looking for love as employees, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=456.8s)]
*  something the creator of Love is Blind has previously resisted. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=463.8s)]
*  He's argued that the show documents, quote, the independent choices of adults who volunteer [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  to participate in a social experiment. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=472.64s)]
*  The board's complaint will now be passed to a judge who will rule on it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=475.56s)]
*  And if the contestants are reclassified as employees, it could open the door for them [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  and other reality show stars to unionize, potentially upending the whole industry by [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  changing the balance of power. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=490.5s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=495.96s)]
*  How China was able to penetrate some of America's biggest phone providers, like AT&T and Verizon, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=498.78s)]
*  in one of the most dramatic hacking cases in American history. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=505.61999999999995s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=510.02s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=514.78s)]
*  The headlines will be back tomorrow. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK30x0LMuRA&t=515.86s)]
