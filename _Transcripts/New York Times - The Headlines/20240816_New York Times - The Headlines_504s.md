# All Eyes on Gaza Cease-Fire Talks, and Kennedy Explores a Cabinet Job
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Thursday, August 15th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=8.64s)]
*  Today in Doha, the capital of Qatar, negotiators are meeting to discuss a potential ceasefire [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=13.72s)]
*  in Gaza, and many world leaders have put the pressure on. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=18.72s)]
*  President Joe Biden, as well as the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, pushed for the meeting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=23.48s)]
*  There was no more time to waste and no excuse for any delays from either Israel or Hamas. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=28.2s)]
*  Israel has sent negotiators. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=34.2s)]
*  Hamas has not, but throughout the war, the group has relied on Qatar and Egypt to relay [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=36.04s)]
*  its proposals. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=40.44s)]
*  Despite the pressure, there's little hope of a breakthrough today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=42.32s)]
*  The two sides have been negotiating for months, and they're deadlocked on several issues. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=46.26s)]
*  As the talks get underway, the Times has learned U.S. officials think Israel's military has [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=52.04s)]
*  reached the end of what it can accomplish on the battlefield. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=57.06s)]
*  American officials are warning that Israel is now in a whack-a-mole strategy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=61.14s)]
*  Julian Barnes covers international intelligence for the Times. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=66.66s)]
*  They're going after small groups of Hamas fighters that pop up here and there, and each [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=70.3s)]
*  of those strikes has diminishing returns. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=76.30000000000001s)]
*  There are fewer fighters being killed, more civilians being killed, and this has the U.S. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=79.04s)]
*  worried. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=85.5s)]
*  U.S. officials believe that Hamas can be degraded, Hamas can be weakened, and it has been. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=86.94s)]
*  It is no longer able to mount a terror attack like it did on October 7th. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=93.54s)]
*  But the U.S. has learned through many years of counterterrorism that you cannot destroy [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  a terror organization. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=104.06s)]
*  You can only diminish it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=105.68s)]
*  In New York, the president of Columbia University, Manu Shafik, resigned last night after months [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=107.84s)]
*  of criticism and uproar over pro-Palestinian protests on campus. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Under her tenure, Columbia became the epicenter of student protests against the war in Gaza, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=124.64000000000001s)]
*  and she faced both accusations that she let anti-Semitism go unchecked and backlash for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=130.44s)]
*  calling in police to break up the demonstrations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=136.5s)]
*  She's now the third leader of an Ivy League school to step down in the last year amid [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=139.82s)]
*  the protests and multiple congressional hearings about anti-Semitism. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=144.3s)]
*  With less than three weeks before classes start at Columbia, Shafik's departure has [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=149.72s)]
*  caught a lot of people there off guard. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=154.56s)]
*  The university's board had repeatedly said they stood behind her, and the campus has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=157.0s)]
*  been quiet this summer. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=161.3s)]
*  Still, Shafik said in her announcement that the last year had taken a considerable toll [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=163.2s)]
*  on her family, and that she thought the best way for Columbia to move forward would be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=167.94s)]
*  without her. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=172.9s)]
*  Columbia's campus is still largely closed to the public. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=173.9s)]
*  It has not been nearly as welcoming and as open of an atmosphere as it has historically been. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=177.34s)]
*  Alan Blinder covers education for the Times. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=184.56s)]
*  Columbia, like a lot of schools around the country, is bracing for the possibility of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=187.42s)]
*  more protest. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=192.24s)]
*  They aren't quite sure what the fall will bring between the war still going. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=193.34s)]
*  They're not quite sure how the presidential election will inflame tensions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=198.16s)]
*  So a lot of schools are bracing for what, you know, could be a pretty long semester, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=203.08s)]
*  and now Columbia is going to be doing it having changed leadership really close to the start [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=207.58s)]
*  of the semester. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=213.0s)]
*  Columbia announced that Dr. Katrina Armstrong, who's led Columbia's medical school, will [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=215.12s)]
*  serve as interim president. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=219.78s)]
*  Faced with dropping poll numbers and a struggle to raise cash, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. seems [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=228.28s)]
*  to be looking for off-ramps from his presidential campaign. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=233.52s)]
*  The Times has learned that Kennedy has repeatedly reached out to Kamala Harris's team, hoping [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  to make a deal, an endorsement of her campaign in exchange for the promise of a cabinet post [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=242.78s)]
*  if she wins the election. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=248.5s)]
*  Harris has so far not engaged. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  Kennedy has also approached Donald Trump. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=253.1s)]
*  Last month, the Washington Post reported that Kennedy talked with Trump about a possible [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=256.14s)]
*  cabinet job in his administration, potentially focused on public health. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=260.26s)]
*  Trump has encouraged Kennedy to drop out of the race. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=265.4s)]
*  Recent polls have shown Kennedy potentially pulling more voters away from him than from [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=268.9s)]
*  Harris. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=273.38s)]
*  Today, the emergency committee met and advised me that in its view, the situation constitutes [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=278.42s)]
*  a public health emergency of international concern. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=289.90000000000003s)]
*  The World Health Organization has declared M.pox a global health emergency. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=293.54s)]
*  The deadly virus, formerly known as monkeypox, has rapidly spread in Africa, reaching 13 [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  countries. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=304.74s)]
*  The infection can cause fevers, respiratory symptoms, and rashes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  This is the second time in three years that the WHO has designated it a global emergency. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=310.02s)]
*  An outbreak in 2022 spread to more than 100 countries, mostly affected gay and bisexual [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  men. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=321.66s)]
*  This year, it appears to be more deadly, and women and children are most at risk. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=322.74s)]
*  So far, the infections have been concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=327.94s)]
*  has reported over 15,000 cases and more than 500 deaths. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=332.3s)]
*  The Congo has already approved the use of two vaccines to try and slow the spread, but [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=336.94s)]
*  so far it hasn't launched an immunization plan. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=341.1s)]
*  And finally, for as long as the internet has been around, there have been online scams. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=350.42s)]
*  But in the past year, one particular type of scam has taken off, using one particularly [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=355.74s)]
*  well-known man to lure people in. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=361.26s)]
*  At Tesla, we are always thinking about how to make your life better and more interesting. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=363.74s)]
*  And today we are implementing another such idea, a unique crypto giveaway that allows [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=369.34s)]
*  you to double your wealth. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=373.98s)]
*  So-called deep fakes of Elon Musk have been pouring into social media feeds, claiming [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  to promote cryptocurrency or cutting-edge investment schemes. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=381.28s)]
*  All you need to do is scan the QR code and make a deposit. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=385.06s)]
*  While there are fake videos of other prominent businessmen like Warren Buffett or Jeff Bezos, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=388.94s)]
*  Musk pops up way more often in these deep fakes, which have been supercharged by a new [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=394.46s)]
*  generation of AI tools that make it easier than ever to clone celebrity voices and manipulate [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=399.24s)]
*  videos. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=404.94s)]
*  The ads are based off of real clips of Musk giving an interview or a speech. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=406.38s)]
*  Often in as little as 10 minutes, scammers, based mostly in India, Russia, China and Eastern [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=415.9s)]
*  Europe, can change the audio and tweak the video to make it look like Musk's mouth is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=421.41999999999996s)]
*  moving in sync with their new script. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=426.73999999999995s)]
*  Experts say that Musk's global fan base of crypto enthusiasts and anti-establishment [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=438.14s)]
*  types are perfect targets for the scams, and social media platforms are struggling [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=443.14s)]
*  to take the ads down as fast as they're being posted. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=447.82s)]
*  One victim of the scam was an 82-year-old retiree in Texas. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=451.82s)]
*  He said a video of Musk that he saw on Facebook was so convincing he could have picked him [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=456.09999999999997s)]
*  out of a lineup, and he ended up losing nearly $700,000 before the company he thought he [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=460.58s)]
*  was dealing with seemed to disappear off the internet. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=466.14s)]
*  In total, experts say people have lost billions to fake Elon Musk and other AI-powered scams. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=469.96s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a Supreme Court ruling earlier this summer opened the door for cities [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=481.56s)]
*  and states to crack down on homeless encampments. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=486.76s)]
*  A look at how that's playing out now in California. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jqbHOX74&t=489.76s)]
