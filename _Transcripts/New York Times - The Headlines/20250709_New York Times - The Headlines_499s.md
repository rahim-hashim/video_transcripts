# Federal Workers Wait for Cuts, Trump Criticizes Putin, Private Equity in Kids Sports | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, July [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=0.0s)]
*  9th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=7.04s)]
*  The Supreme Court has given the Trump administration the green light to slash the federal workforce [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=13.72s)]
*  and dismantle government agencies. It's something the White House has been trying to do since [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=18.84s)]
*  February when President Trump signed an executive order calling for mass layoffs. But as departments [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=23.36s)]
*  started carrying that out, legal challenges poured in with lawsuits claiming the president [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=29.6s)]
*  had overstepped, infringing on Congress's power. This spring, a lower court hit pause [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=34.68s)]
*  on many of the layoffs ruling Trump did exceed his authority. But the Supreme Court has now [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  overruled that. The justices didn't weigh in on whether the specific downsizing plans [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  are within the president's authority, but they are allowing the administration to move [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=51.78s)]
*  forward for now. Thousands of workers who've been caught in the legal limbo are bracing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=56.08s)]
*  for what's next. The promised layoffs have been weighing on them for months, and federal [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=61.44s)]
*  workers have told me how they don't even want to open emails because they're afraid of what [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=67.8s)]
*  they might find inside. My colleague Eileen Sullivan is a reporter at the Times Washington [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=73.2s)]
*  Bureau. Some have already been told that they would be part of future layoffs, and so they [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=78.2s)]
*  are waiting to find out when they will get that notification from the government. Others [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=84.64s)]
*  only know that there will be future layoffs, and they're waiting to hear if they're going [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=90.88s)]
*  to be part of them. The cuts, when they do come, will have a wide impact across the country [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=95.4s)]
*  as services that people may not even realize the federal government provides start to be [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=102.6s)]
*  scaled back. The question of whether the president has the authority to carry out mass layoffs [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=108.76s)]
*  could end up back at the Supreme Court later on, though some of the groups representing [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  government workers say that will be too late if people have already been fired and agencies [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=120.48s)]
*  have already been gutted, writing, quote, There will be no way to unscramble that egg. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm not happy with Putin. I'm not happy with Putin. I can tell you that much right now, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=137.72s)]
*  because he's killing a lot of people. President Trump railed against Russian President Vladimir [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=141.76s)]
*  Putin at a cabinet meeting yesterday, accusing him of being dishonest in negotiations to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  end the war in Ukraine. We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin for you want to know [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=152.76s)]
*  the truth. He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless. Trump's comments [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=157.76s)]
*  were some of his harshest towards Putin yet, and they were a remarkable turnaround for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=164.44000000000003s)]
*  the president, who has at times praised Putin while blaming Ukraine for the ongoing fighting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=169.12s)]
*  there. Recently, though, Trump has become increasingly frustrated that Putin hasn't [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  been cooperating with Trump's push for a peace deal. Russia instead has sharply escalated [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  its attacks on Ukraine. Putin is not he's not treating human beings right. He's killing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=185.08s)]
*  too many people. So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine. And I've approved that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=191.0s)]
*  Last week, the U.S. had paused some arms transfers to Ukraine over concerns that Pentagon stockpiles [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=198.08s)]
*  might be dwindling. Trump now says the U.S. will resume sending weapons. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=204.12s)]
*  The Times has been looking at how Truth Social, President Trump's social media platform, is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  struggling and how its parent company may be trying to pivot. Trump Media and Technology [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=221.84s)]
*  Group, which owns Truth Social, has seen its stock drop in value ever since it went public [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=227.5s)]
*  last year. This year, shares are down 43 percent, and the company has yet to post a profit. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  While the president has more than 10 million followers on the site, Truth Social has had [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=239.36s)]
*  a difficult time attracting more users. People mostly use it just to see what Trump's saying. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=243.64s)]
*  According to one analytics company, 80 percent of the site's traffic last month went to his [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  posts. And for advertising dollars, the site's been reliant on a niche corner of the ad market, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=254.55999999999997s)]
*  companies catering to hardcore Trump fans and Christian conservatives, often selling [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=260.4s)]
*  Trump t-shirts or other paraphernalia. With the social media platform not generating much [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=264.8s)]
*  revenue, Trump Media's been undergoing a metamorphosis, turning toward crypto ventures. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=269.8s)]
*  It's raised over $2 billion to invest in Bitcoin and is partnering on multiple crypto-related [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=276.04s)]
*  investment funds. The shift is one of the Trump family's many deepening connections [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=281.72s)]
*  to the crypto industry, which has drawn criticism, coming at the same time as the administration [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=286.76s)]
*  has taken a light touch on regulating crypto. The White House told the Times there are no [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=292.04s)]
*  conflicts of interest because while the president is the largest shareholder in Trump Media, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  he has no official position at the company and his shares are in a trust managed by his oldest son. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=302.70000000000005s)]
*  We have some very exciting news to announce that TSA will no longer require travelers [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=313.42s)]
*  to remove their shoes when they go through our security checkpoints. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=318.86s)]
*  At airports across the country, if you didn't get the memo yet, you can now keep your shoes [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=322.38000000000005s)]
*  on. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem officially announced the policy change [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=327.22s)]
*  yesterday. Though some travelers had been reporting for the last few days that they [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  were making it through, laces still tied. We took a hard look at how TSA does its business, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=335.86s)]
*  how it does its screening processes, and what we do to make people safe, but also provide [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  some hospitality as well. Noem said the change is part of a broader [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=347.94s)]
*  reevaluation of airport security. The no shoes policy was put in place 20 years ago [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=351.62s)]
*  for fears of terrorism. Since then, security technology has significantly evolved. There [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=356.9s)]
*  are more advanced body and baggage scanners, and some checkpoints now use biometrics to confirm [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=362.42s)]
*  people's identities. Noem also alluded to more changes that could be coming in the near future, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=367.94s)]
*  which include a trial program where travelers could pass through checkpoints without ever [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=373.46s)]
*  interacting with officers. Even that 3.4 ounce limit on liquids that has everyone [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=378.34s)]
*  digging around to get their toothpaste out of their carry-on could eventually be phased [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=384.02s)]
*  out as Noem said, quote, every rule is being evaluated. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=388.41999999999996s)]
*  And finally, the amount of money parents are spending on youth sports is skyrocketing, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  and private equity is increasingly trying to cash in on the lucrative industry. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=403.62s)]
*  Tens of millions of American kids play sports. According to one estimate, the industry generates [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=408.18s)]
*  around $40 billion a year. That's almost five times the box office hall of all movies in the US. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=413.62s)]
*  To get a piece of that, investors are buying up sports camps, athletic complexes, and youth leagues. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=421.06s)]
*  They're even pouring cash into sports-focused boarding schools. For example, a private equity [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=426.82s)]
*  backed fund bought up IMG Academy in Florida, which has more than 150 courts and fields and costs [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=432.66s)]
*  $85,000 a year to attend. Parents and coaches are raising concerns that the drive to make money off [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=440.1s)]
*  of kids' sports could ramp up the costs for families. You could be paying for ice time from [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=446.66s)]
*  a private company instead of from your local community center. Tournament fees might go up. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=452.26000000000005s)]
*  That could further accelerate the income disparity that already exists in youth sports. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  One study found that teens from wealthier families were almost [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=462.26s)]
*  twice as likely to play high school sports as those from low-income households. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, how members of the Trump administration helped fuel [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  conspiracy theories around Jeffrey Epstein and why the White House is now trying to shut those [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  theories down. That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=484.98s)]
*  your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b6ajYBg0BM&t=489.62s)]
