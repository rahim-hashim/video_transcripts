# Israel Vows Retaliation Against Iran, and Takeaways From the Debate
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=5.2s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, October 2nd. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=6.2s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=8.64s)]
*  The Middle East is on high alert this morning after Iran fired a wave of missiles at Israel, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=13.44s)]
*  and Israel vowed to retaliate. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Iran's attack last night triggered air raid sirens and sent millions of people scrambling [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  for shelter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=29.28s)]
*  About 180 missiles were fired toward Israel, and there were loud booms and fiery streaks [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  of light in the skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as many of the missiles were intercepted. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  The attack did not cause substantial damage. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  Only one death was reported. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=45.0s)]
*  But the strikes marked the latest violent turn in the escalating conflict between Israel, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=47.08s)]
*  Iran and Iran's proxy forces. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=52.96s)]
*  Iran said the strikes were retaliation for recent Israeli assassinations of Hezbollah [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=56.16s)]
*  and Hamas leaders. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  In response, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran made a big mistake and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=62.8s)]
*  it will pay for the strikes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  Now Iran is bracing for a counterattack. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=71.52s)]
*  They've put all their armed forces on the highest alert. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=74.6s)]
*  They are issuing statement after statement that if Israel or the United States strikes [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=77.96s)]
*  Iran, Iran will strike even with more force. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=84.12s)]
*  And two of my sources who are in the Revolutionary Guard said that hundreds of ballistic missiles [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=89.04s)]
*  were placed in launchers and ready along Iran's border. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=94.36s)]
*  Farnaz Fasihi covers Iran for the Times. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=98.68s)]
*  She says fears of a full-blown war between Iran and Israel have been building for the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=101.76s)]
*  past year. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=106.76s)]
*  Now it seems closer than ever. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=108.34s)]
*  This moment feels different. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  It feels different because Israel's attacks recently have been more brazen and they've [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=112.28s)]
*  blown through red lines. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=117.16s)]
*  And Iran's attack Tuesday was also a brazen attack because it had the element of surprise. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=119.2s)]
*  So we have to see if this is going to lead into a longer period of battle. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=124.64s)]
*  Even the Iranians acknowledge that Israel has the upper hand in military and intelligence. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=129.28s)]
*  But what the Iranians do really well and they've demonstrated is that even if they lose their [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=135.76s)]
*  short-term battle, they strategize for the longer-term battle, you know, in terms of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=140.56s)]
*  trying to create chaos with the proxies or continuing to escalate in other ways. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=145.88s)]
*  At my direction, the United States military actively supported the defense of Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=157.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Biden said that the U.S. had coordinated with Israel to defend against [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=162.16s)]
*  the Iranian attack and that U.S. forces in the Eastern Mediterranean helped shoot down [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=167.2s)]
*  some of the incoming missiles. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=172.6s)]
*  Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=174.6s)]
*  Biden's unqualified declaration of support for Israel marked a shift in tone for the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  president after his growing criticism of Israel's war in Gaza and the civilian death toll there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  At a separate press conference, the president's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=191.67999999999998s)]
*  said there had been meticulous planning between the U.S. and Israel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  When asked whether or not the U.S. would participate in a possible Israeli counter-strike against [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  Iran, Sullivan declined to answer. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=206.48s)]
*  Now, this is likely the final debate of this election cycle and voting is already underway [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=209.84s)]
*  in 20 states. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=222.16s)]
*  Tim Walz and JD Vance faced off last night in New York City for the vice presidential [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=223.68s)]
*  debate. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=228.4s)]
*  The whole thing was less personal and more policy than the matchup between their running [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=229.4s)]
*  mates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump last month. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=234.16s)]
*  I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we get better [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=237.32s)]
*  leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, the American [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=240.92s)]
*  dream is going to be attainable once again. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=245.28s)]
*  Vance and Walz fielded questions on the economy, immigration, and abortion. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=247.76s)]
*  Donald Trump put this all into motion. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=252.84s)]
*  He brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe vs. Wade. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=255.44s)]
*  For his part, Walz leaned hard into the issue after struggling to find his footing on other [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=261.12s)]
*  topics earlier in the debate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=265.8s)]
*  Vance, meanwhile, tried to paint Trump as the candidate of stability, even claiming [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump, quote, peacefully gave over power after the 2020 election. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  And in one of the most notable exchanges of the evening, Vance refused to concede that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump lost that race. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=281.92s)]
*  He is still saying he didn't lose the election. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=283.44s)]
*  I would just ask that. Did he lose the 2020 election? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=285.84s)]
*  Tim, I'm focused on the future. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=288.88s)]
*  Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=290.84s)]
*  COVID situation? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=296.4s)]
*  That is a damning non-answer. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=297.64s)]
*  It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  Despite that back and forth, the overall tone for the night was civil. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=303.64s)]
*  Both men leaned into their Midwestern manners, sometimes to an almost comic degree and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=307.64s)]
*  spoken exceptionally polite tones in a way that we're not necessarily used to seeing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=313.55999999999995s)]
*  on debate stages in recent years. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=319.12s)]
*  Times political reporter Katie Glick was at the debate. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=322.2s)]
*  The reality is that most vice presidential debates do not end up moving the dial in a [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=325.24s)]
*  significant way in presidential contests. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=331.72s)]
*  But in an extremely close and hard fought race where we are talking about states that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=334.72s)]
*  will be won truly on the margins, you know, within a small group of still undecided [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  voters, it'll be important to watch whether some of those voters came away feeling any [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=346.8s)]
*  more comfortable about their options after watching the vice presidential debate. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=352.44s)]
*  In Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum was sworn into office yesterday, becoming the country's [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=361.8s)]
*  first woman president. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=366.8s)]
*  At her inauguration ceremony, Sheinbaum said women had arrived to lead the destiny of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=368.36s)]
*  Mexico, adding, quote, I say we arrived because I do not arrive alone. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=373.36s)]
*  We all arrived. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  Thousands packed into Mexico City's main square to celebrate her. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=381.24s)]
*  One woman from Tijuana told The Times she traveled by bus for more than 50 hours to be [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=385.44s)]
*  there for the moment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=390.32s)]
*  Sheinbaum said she was very happy to be there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  She's also the first Jewish president of the country. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  She won the election earlier this year with a large margin, but she faces a complex series [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  of challenges, including the largest budget deficit in decades, security concerns over [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=403.48s)]
*  rising cartel violence, and the recent controversial overhaul of the country's courts. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=408.92s)]
*  A real test for her leadership, Claudia Sheinbaum was a former president of Mexico City, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  and she is now the first woman president to ever have a seat in the national national [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  court. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=423.68s)]
*  A test for her leadership may come once the results of the American election are clear. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=424.68s)]
*  Harris would likely extend the cooperation between Mexico and the U.S. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  that Biden has promoted, while Trump has proposed stricter trade policies and even floated [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=433.08s)]
*  deploying the U.S. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=439.32s)]
*  military to fight cartels on Mexican soil, which could ratchet up tensions between the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=440.32s)]
*  two countries. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=445.52s)]
*  Secondhand clothing sales are booming. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=454.0s)]
*  The apparel resale markets worth almost double what it was less than a decade ago, by one [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=457.0s)]
*  estimate. And last year, it grew at seven times the rate of the wider retail industry. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=462.04s)]
*  Consumers are turning to used options in part in reaction to concerns about overconsumption [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=468.24s)]
*  or the climate impact of manufacturing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=474.04s)]
*  Some of the used sales are happening online, but a lot is still good old fashioned vintage [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=477.04s)]
*  or thrift shopping in person. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=482.04s)]
*  There's something about being able to see and try on used clothing that's still resonating [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=484.48s)]
*  with people to the point that secondhand storefronts are opening even as other shops [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  struggle and close. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=493.8s)]
*  The retail giants have noticed and they want in. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=495.88s)]
*  This year, Banana Republic opened a shop that sells its own branded merchandise from the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=499.68s)]
*  80s and 90s. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=504.52000000000004s)]
*  And the outdoor apparel brand REI now has two standalone shops exclusively selling used [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=506.24s)]
*  items. One retail consultant told the Times that despite how easy it is to shop online, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=511.68s)]
*  the uniqueness of shopping resale, where every item is different, offers a sense of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=518.16s)]
*  discovery and excitement that you don't get with a click, calling it, quote, finally a [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=523.2s)]
*  reason to go to the store. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=528.4s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=532.92s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a deeper look at last night's debate and why it felt so different than [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=534.28s)]
*  other matchups in recent elections. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=539.36s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=542.0s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jef7tcbTIs&t=543.16s)]
