# Musk's Growing Power, and Russia Releases American Teacher
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=4.92s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, February 12th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=7.8s)]
*  We're going to be signing a very important deal today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=9.68s)]
*  It's Doge. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=17.96s)]
*  And I'm going to ask Elon to tell you a little bit about it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=18.96s)]
*  In the Oval Office yesterday, President Trump announced a new executive order expanding [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=23.36s)]
*  Elon Musk's mandate to overhaul the federal government. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=28.84s)]
*  It calls for, quote, large scale cuts at federal agencies and says that Musk's so-called Department [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=32.8s)]
*  of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, will need to sign off on most new hires going forward. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=39.24s)]
*  If your taxpayer dollars are not spent in a sensible and prugal manner, then that's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=45.16s)]
*  not OK. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=49.4s)]
*  For about 30 minutes, Trump had Musk, who was standing next to him wearing a black autographed [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=50.64s)]
*  MAGA hat, take the floor and talk to reporters. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=55.32s)]
*  It's the first time that Musk has answered questions since he started his overhaul, and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=58.4s)]
*  he defended the slash and burn campaign that he's been carrying out against federal agencies. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=63.16s)]
*  We have this unelected fourth unconstitutional branch of government, which is the bureaucracy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=68.12s)]
*  which has in a lot of ways currently more power than any elected representative. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=73.84s)]
*  Musk said federal workers have far too much power over Americans' lives, though as a special [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  government employee himself, Musk has been allowed to operate nearly unchecked. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  Musk also claimed, without giving any proof, that he'd found widespread corruption in the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=89.84s)]
*  government, which reporters pressed him about. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=94.28s)]
*  And how can we make sure that all the statements that you said were correct so we can trust [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=97.12s)]
*  what you say? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=102.2s)]
*  Well, first of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=103.2s)]
*  So nobody can about a thousand. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=107.84s)]
*  Over the course of the press conference, Musk also dodged questions about his potential [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=109.68s)]
*  conflicts of interest, given the billions of dollars in contracts his companies have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=114.12s)]
*  with the government and the multiple federal investigations they're facing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=118.36s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=126.72s)]
*  What they're doing in the executive branch, I've been asked so many times, aren't you [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=127.72s)]
*  uncomfortable with this? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=130.8s)]
*  No, I'm not because... [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=131.8s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson said he, quote, wholeheartedly agrees that the Trump administration [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=133.36s)]
*  can keep making cuts to federal spending, taking a position that is at odds with the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=138.6s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=143.48s)]
*  The Constitution says Congress decides how federal money should be spent, and the executive [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  branch is supposed to carry that out. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  Instead, the Trump administration has been withholding funds that Congress signed off [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=152.64s)]
*  on in a direct challenge to the separation of powers. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Johnson still praised the effort, framing it as a forensic audit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=161.72s)]
*  Yesterday, the Trump administration struck a deal with the Kremlin to release an American [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=165.96s)]
*  prisoner, Mark Fogel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  I feel like the luckiest man on earth right now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=177.32s)]
*  Fogel was working as a teacher in Russia when he was arrested in 2021 on charges of bringing [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=180.44s)]
*  medical marijuana into the country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=184.84s)]
*  He was sentenced to over a decade in prison. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=187.32s)]
*  I want you to know that I am not a hero in this at all. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  President Trump is a hero. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=193.56s)]
*  He was released after Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Whitkoff, flew to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=196.04s)]
*  Russia personally on his own jet for a meeting. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=200.66s)]
*  It was the first time a senior U.S. official has been to the country since before Russia [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=203.48s)]
*  invaded Ukraine, and Whitkoff flew back with Fogel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=208.08s)]
*  Hours later, Trump hosted Fogel at the White House. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=211.84s)]
*  And we appreciate President Putin's, what he did. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=215.24s)]
*  He was able to pull it off for you, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=218.72s)]
*  We don't know the contours of this deal. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=222.64s)]
*  Specifically, we don't know what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in order to get Mark Fogel [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=225.16s)]
*  released. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=230.2s)]
*  But it's already clear this is a win in its own way, both for Trump and for Putin. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=231.76s)]
*  Anton Troianovsky covers Russia for the Times. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump got that photo op in the White House with this released American. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  this major step toward establishing a closer relationship with Trump. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=247.64s)]
*  And it's really important for Putin to get on Trump's good side and stay there because [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=252.72s)]
*  he sees the United States as the biggest obstacle to his ability to win the war in Ukraine. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=258.56s)]
*  And in many ways, that's true. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=267.84s)]
*  The U.S. is by far Ukraine's most important ally, providing a huge amount of weaponry [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  and financial assistance. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=275.56s)]
*  Trump has already said that he thinks the U.S. has been making a mistake in providing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=277.56s)]
*  all that assistance, that the war needs to end. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  And so Putin clearly sees a massive opportunity here that he's trying to capitalize on. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  President Trump himself said that the prisoner deal could be a first step toward ending the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=292.12s)]
*  war in Ukraine and said more details would be announced today. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=296.64s)]
*  U.S. officials say another American will also be released, but they did not say who. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising, quote, intense fighting in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=316.64s)]
*  Gaza if Hamas does not go through with a plan to release more hostages this weekend. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=321.24s)]
*  He's accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire deal by postponing hostage releases. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=326.8s)]
*  Hamas has accused Israel of violating the agreement by blocking humanitarian aid and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=332.08s)]
*  firing on civilians. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=336.32s)]
*  The ceasefire has been in place for nearly a month. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=338.44s)]
*  It's supposed to continue for several more weeks with the possibility to extend it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  In Monterey County, California last month... [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=350.48s)]
*  There is a fire at the Vista Energy Facility there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  A battery plant caught fire. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=356.72s)]
*  It only got a fraction of the coverage of the wildfires that were happening in Los Angeles [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=358.92s)]
*  at the same time, but it burned for days, emitting thick plumes of smoke. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=362.68s)]
*  We've been told to leave, and I don't mind doing that because honestly I don't feel safe [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=367.88s)]
*  this close to this facility. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=372.24s)]
*  The plant was filled with lithium ion batteries, which contain heavy metals that can cause [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=374.2s)]
*  lung damage or neurological problems when inhaled. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=379.04s)]
*  Residents nearby reported a metallic taste in the air. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=382.88s)]
*  They said they got headaches, sore throats, bloody noses. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=386.44s)]
*  One man, who lived 25 miles from the fire, told the Times it felt like the air was burning [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=390.16s)]
*  his lungs. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=395.6s)]
*  Now people in the area are concerned about long-term health effects and the impact on [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=397.44s)]
*  local agriculture, the areas known for growing strawberries and other produce. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=402.16s)]
*  After the blaze, a state agency tested the soil for miles around the plant and found [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=407.56s)]
*  elevated levels of the heavy metals found in lithium batteries. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=411.96s)]
*  The fire has also raised questions about the safety of California's clean energy efforts. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=416.4s)]
*  The state relies on battery plants, like the one that burned, to store electricity gathered [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=421.52s)]
*  during the day and release it to the grid at night. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=426.28s)]
*  But lithium ion battery fires are notoriously hard to put out, since they can't be extinguished [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=429.02s)]
*  with water. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=434.0s)]
*  Current best practice is just to let them burn. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=435.24s)]
*  One county supervisor told the Times, quote, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=438.84s)]
*  We are right now in a place where government does not have the knowledge to regulate this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=441.16s)]
*  technology and industry does not have the know-how to control it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=444.92s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=461.04s)]
*  This year's nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame were announced this morning. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=467.0s)]
*  And there's a mix of eras and genres, everybody from Joe Cocker to Billy Idol to Oasis, Fish [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=471.12s)]
*  and Outkast. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=477.2s)]
*  The Hall of Fame has been facing pressure in recent years for how few women it's recognized. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=479.6s)]
*  And this year's list likely won't change that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=484.48s)]
*  Only two women are nominated, Cyndi Lauper and the queen of the high note, Mariah Carey. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=487.4s)]
*  The person maybe most excited to see his name, though, is 83-year-old Chubby Checker. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=492.48s)]
*  His 1960s cover of The Twist is one of the biggest hits in Billboard singles history. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  Checker has been pushing for this for years. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=509.6s)]
*  He even took out an ad over 20 years ago in Billboard magazine, calling on the Hall of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=513.32s)]
*  Fame and also boldly on the group behind the Nobel prizes to recognize him for his work. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=519.8s)]
*  He wrote, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=526.4s)]
*  The Hall of Fame will announce which of the nominees make the cut in April. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=532.0s)]
*  In the meantime, a quick update on another award that many of you had strong feelings [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=536.28s)]
*  about. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  I told you earlier this week that Golden Retrievers have never won the top award at the Westminster [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  Kennel Club Dog Show. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu3DLNOgwPw&t=546.3199999999999s)]
