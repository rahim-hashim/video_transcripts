# Harris and Trump’s Next Moves, and Francine Lashes Southern Louisiana
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Thursday, September 12th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=8.0s)]
*  In the wake of the Harris-Trump debate, both campaigns are in full strategy mode, trying [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  to read public reaction and mapping out their next moves with just eight weeks to go until [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Election Day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=23.94s)]
*  67 million people watched the debate, making it the most watched moment of the 2024 presidential [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=25.54s)]
*  race. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=31.66s)]
*  And many commentators, even Republicans, have concluded that Harris succeeded in knocking [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=32.66s)]
*  Trump off the messaging his team had hoped he'd stick to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=37.98s)]
*  The debate on Tuesday did not go how Donald Trump's allies and supporters had hoped. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=41.94s)]
*  Times politics reporter Shane Goldmacher covers Trump's campaign. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=48.42s)]
*  He says while Trump has been calling it his best debate ever, privately, several of his [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=51.98s)]
*  aides and allies have conceded he had a rough performance. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=57.019999999999996s)]
*  His team had prepared him for pivots during this debate, how to transition from attacks [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=60.94s)]
*  that Kamala Harris was expected to make back to the issues he wanted to talk about, chiefly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=65.74s)]
*  the economy and immigration. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=70.3s)]
*  Instead, he was drawn into the fights that Harris wanted him to have. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=72.14s)]
*  His supporters are bracing for the possibility of a series of negative news cycles and even [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=76.56s)]
*  a potential bump in the polls for Kamala Harris. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=81.34s)]
*  Now he's looking to get back on track. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=84.9s)]
*  He's scheduled to go to Tucson and Los Angeles and then a rally in Las Vegas as well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=88.18s)]
*  A series of events, some of which are built specifically about the economy in order to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=93.7s)]
*  get himself back on the topics that he wants to talk about. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Times politics reporter Reid Epstein's been covering Harris's post debate plan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=101.7s)]
*  The Harris campaign believes it's finally been able to do what President Biden couldn't [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=107.66s)]
*  and that's make the 2024 election a real referendum on Donald Trump and his fitness and capacity [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=112.94s)]
*  to serve again as president of the United States. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=120.28s)]
*  With Tuesday's debate, Harris's campaign believes that the American people and voters in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=124.02s)]
*  critical battleground states will turn their focus to whether Trump is up for the job and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=129.82s)]
*  they intend to place this question at the front of voters minds through her public appearances [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=135.86s)]
*  and television advertising through the last eight weeks of the campaign. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=142.46s)]
*  Reid says that Harris's team is all in on a second debate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=147.66000000000003s)]
*  For his part, Trump said yesterday he didn't know if he would agree to that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=151.82000000000002s)]
*  In Ohio, the town of Springfield has landed in the middle of the immigration debate and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=160.62s)]
*  the presidential race. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=165.66s)]
*  In 2020, the population of the town was just under 60,000 and shrinking. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=167.26s)]
*  But city officials say that 20,000 Haitians have arrived there in the last few years, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=172.82s)]
*  taking up manufacturing and warehouse jobs and helping revitalize the town. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=177.78s)]
*  Their arrival has put pressure on housing, schools and health services and tensions have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  simmered, ramping up over the last few months. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=188.5s)]
*  But they reached a new height when Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, made the Haitians [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=191.9s)]
*  one of his talking points. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=195.86s)]
*  He claimed Springfield was overwhelmed and there were people who, quote, shouldn't be [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  in this country, even though the Haitians are in the U.S. legally. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=201.96s)]
*  Vance amplified an outrageous false claim that the immigrants were eating their neighbors' [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=206.38s)]
*  pets, a claim that Trump himself then repeated in this week's debate. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=210.66s)]
*  And Vance evoked one family's tragedy, writing on social media that a child was murdered [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=215.38s)]
*  by a Haitian migrant. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=220.54s)]
*  The child is Aiden Clark. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=221.78s)]
*  He died last summer when a Haitian driver in a minivan crossed the center line and crashed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=224.26s)]
*  into a school bus. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=228.78s)]
*  To clear the air, my son, Aiden Clark, was not murdered. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=229.78s)]
*  He was accidentally killed by an immigrant from Haiti. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=235.42s)]
*  This week, Clark's father, Nathan, spoke out against the politicians who've been talking [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=238.89999999999998s)]
*  about his community, including Trump and Vance. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=243.38s)]
*  And look what you've done to us. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=246.34s)]
*  We have to get up here and beg them to stop. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=249.5s)]
*  Using Aiden as a political tool is, to say the least, reprehensible for any political [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=252.94s)]
*  purpose. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=258.3s)]
*  At a town meeting, Clark called on them to stop spreading hate in his son's name. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=259.58s)]
*  I wish that my son, Aiden Clark, was killed by a 60-year-old white man. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=266.34s)]
*  I bet you never thought anyone would ever say something so blunt. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=272.46s)]
*  But if that guy killed my 11-year-old son, the incessant group of hate-spewing people [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=279.73999999999995s)]
*  would leave us alone. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=286.65999999999997s)]
*  In Louisiana this morning, hundreds of thousands of people are without power, and local officials [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  are warning about dangerous flooding after Hurricane Francine made landfall. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=301.98s)]
*  The storm strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane just an hour before coming ashore near New [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=306.94s)]
*  Orleans yesterday. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=311.14s)]
*  The airport closed down, and many colleges and universities in the area canceled classes [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=312.78s)]
*  today and warned students to stay sheltered. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=317.38s)]
*  Francine, which is now weakened to a tropical storm, is tearing through a stretch of the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=320.5s)]
*  country that's been battered by a number of devastating storms in recent years. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=324.82s)]
*  The storm in Ida, which hit the coast as a Category 4 in 2021, caused so much damage [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=330.42s)]
*  and then made insurance so unaffordable that many residents left the region altogether. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=336.46s)]
*  New Orleans has seen the steepest population drop of any major metro area in the country. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=342.3s)]
*  Election officials are raising the alarm that issues with the Postal Service could prevent [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=355.5s)]
*  some Americans' votes from being counted this year. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=359.38s)]
*  A bipartisan group of officials from around the country sent a letter to the U.S. Postal [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=362.7s)]
*  Service yesterday urging it to take action on lost and delayed mail. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=367.1s)]
*  Officials say they've seen hundreds of recent instances where ballots are arriving 10 days [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=372.58s)]
*  or more after being postmarked. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=376.82s)]
*  As first-class mail, ballots are supposed to get there in three to five days. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=379.2s)]
*  They also warned that some ballots were being mistakenly marked as undeliverable, which [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=383.9s)]
*  could eventually get people kicked off of voting roles for being inactive. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=388.1s)]
*  The letter said, we implore you to take immediate and tangible corrective action, and that, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=392.54s)]
*  quote, failure to do so will risk limiting voter participation and trust in the election [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=398.14000000000004s)]
*  process. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=403.06s)]
*  In response to the letter, the Postal Service told the Associated Press that there have [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=404.62s)]
*  been issues with mail delivery as it works to modernize its systems, but that it's ready [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=408.5s)]
*  to handle election season. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=413.02000000000004s)]
*  Still, the Postal Service urged people voting by mail not to procrastinate. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=415.22s)]
*  And finally, marmosets are chatty. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=426.82s)]
*  The small South American monkeys whistle and chirp and trill, and a new study says that [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=431.66s)]
*  buried in all of that noise, the monkeys are calling each other by name. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=436.82s)]
*  They're the first non-human primates to be observed doing that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=442.3s)]
*  The research went like this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=445.86s)]
*  They'd bring two monkeys into a room. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=447.06s)]
*  They could see each other, talk it up. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=448.98s)]
*  Then a curtain would come down between them. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=451.06s)]
*  Recordings show that when the monkeys lost sight of each other, they'd start producing [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=454.1s)]
*  unique high-pitched calls. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=457.86s)]
*  After analyzing over 50,000 of those calls, the researchers found differences depending [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=460.86s)]
*  on who a monkey was calling out to. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=465.98s)]
*  For a long time, scientists used to think giving names was a uniquely human thing to [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=468.72s)]
*  do. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  Then dolphins were observed using names, and parrots. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=474.56s)]
*  And earlier this year, scientists announced elephants seemed to be doing it too, in their [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=478.0s)]
*  low-pitched rumbles. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  One biologist told the Times, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  I think what it's telling us is that it's likely that animals actually have names for [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=486.2s)]
*  each other a lot more than maybe we ever conceived. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=489.88s)]
*  We just never were really looking properly. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=493.12s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Nippon Steel, a Japanese company, has been trying to buy the company [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  U.S. Steel for $15 billion. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=504.4s)]
*  Why President Biden is likely to take the rare step of blocking the deal. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=507.85999999999996s)]
*  You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1nkrJjsfyY&t=512.64s)]
