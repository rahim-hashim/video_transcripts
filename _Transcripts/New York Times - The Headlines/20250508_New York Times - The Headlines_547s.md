# A First-Person View of a Deadly Gaza Strike, and a Severe U.S. Flu Season
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=4.86s)]
*  Today's Thursday, May 8th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=5.86s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=7.7s)]
*  My name is Mona Bushnak. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=14.1s)]
*  I'm a senior photo editor with the International Desk at the New York Times. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=15.42s)]
*  Early afternoon, I got a message from our freelance photographer in the Gaza Strip, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=20.22s)]
*  telling me that he was at the scene of a strike at a restaurant in Gaza City, and he has strong pictures. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=26.98s)]
*  So I asked him to send them over, and what we saw was really graphic images and videos from the scene of the strike. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=34.980000000000004s)]
*  In Gaza yesterday, the Israeli military carried out widespread airstrikes across the territory, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  killing dozens of people, according to Gaza's health ministry. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  The deadliest attack was at a popular restaurant in northern Gaza, just across the street from where the Times photographer happened to be. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=52.98s)]
*  So I called him up, and he said that he was at a cafe using the internet and just having coffee with his friends, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=59.98s)]
*  and heard a sudden explosion and saw some smoke coming from the restaurant. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=68.97999999999999s)]
*  He picked up his gear and ran to the restaurant. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  And the scene that unfolded in front of him, there were many bodies on the floor. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=77.98s)]
*  He saw people taking their last breaths just right before they died and wounded people as well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=83.98s)]
*  In one photo, one man was holding a prayer rug to his head wound. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=90.98s)]
*  And then in another photo, we see that a man was carrying the body of what seemed to be a child, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=95.98s)]
*  and the body was mostly covered with a blue sheet, but you could see his arms and legs draped on the sides. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=101.98s)]
*  Saher asked the man who the boy was, and he told him he was his nephew. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=109.98s)]
*  His name is Karam, he's five years old, and he was killed in the strike on his way back from kindergarten. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=115.98s)]
*  In all, 33 people were killed at the restaurant. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=126.98s)]
*  The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the target of the attack. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=129.98s)]
*  The strikes came just after Israel announced an aggressive new push into Gaza, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=135.98s)]
*  saying it plans to force all two million residents there into the southern part of the territory. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=140.98s)]
*  Meanwhile, at Columbia University, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=148.98s)]
*  Free, free, free, politics! [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=150.98s)]
*  Dozens of protesters occupied the main library yesterday [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=155.98s)]
*  in an attempt to rekindle the pro-Palestinian protests that swept the school last year. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=159.98s)]
*  Several protesters and public safety officers were injured in the chaotic scene, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=164.98s)]
*  and after several hours, Columbia's president authorized New York City police to enter the library, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=169.98s)]
*  where they detained about 70 demonstrators. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=175.98s)]
*  The school has been under intense pressure from the Trump administration to suppress pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=177.98s)]
*  Earlier this year, the White House cut off more than $400 million in federal funds for the school, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=183.98s)]
*  accusing it of failing to protect Jewish students from harassment. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=188.98s)]
*  The university has been in ongoing negotiations with the administration to try and get that funding restored. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=192.98s)]
*  The United States is nearing the end of what's been a particularly brutal flu season. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=203.98s)]
*  An estimated 47 million people caught it, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=208.98s)]
*  with many parts of the country reporting high or very high levels, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=211.98s)]
*  and the number of hospitalizations for influenza was the most in 15 years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=214.98s)]
*  A number of factors likely contributed to the surge. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=219.98s)]
*  For one, researchers believe it could be about the particular strain circulating this year. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=222.98s)]
*  Some of it may also be a lingering consequence of pandemic social distancing, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=227.98s)]
*  when many common viruses didn't circulate as much and people's immune systems got out of practice. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=231.98s)]
*  Another factor medical experts are pointing to is vaccination rates. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=238.98s)]
*  Amid a growing distrust of the scientific establishment, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=242.98s)]
*  some people have been questioning the safety and effectiveness of flu shots and other vaccines, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=245.98s)]
*  and vaccination rates have been dropping. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=250.98s)]
*  In New York State, for example, 25 children died from the flu this season, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=253.98s)]
*  and the state health commissioner said that of the kids who were old enough to be vaccinated, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=258.98s)]
*  only one had gotten the flu shot. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=262.98s)]
*  Flu season typically peters out in May. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=264.98s)]
*  In Washington, President Trump has changed up his choice for Surgeon General. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=271.98s)]
*  His first pick had been Dr. Jeanette Neswatt, a former Fox News contributor. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=275.98s)]
*  She was scheduled to appear in front of the Senate Health Committee today, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=280.98s)]
*  but her nomination ran into trouble on two fronts. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=283.98s)]
*  The conservative activist Laura Loomer, who Trump has listened to on other staffing matters, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=286.98s)]
*  claimed she wasn't ideologically aligned with the president, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=291.98s)]
*  and there have been allegations that she lied about her resume. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=294.98s)]
*  Trump's new pick is Dr. Casey Means. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=297.98s)]
*  The message I'm here to share is that American health is getting destroyed. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=300.98s)]
*  It's being destroyed because of chronic illness. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=305.98s)]
*  Means is a Stanford-educated doctor turned wellness influencer [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=307.98s)]
*  who frequently casts doubt on the American medical system. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=311.98s)]
*  She's an ally of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=315.98s)]
*  and has shared his criticisms of processed foods and the pharmaceutical industry. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=318.98s)]
*  She's also echoed some of Kennedy's skepticism of vaccines, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=323.98s)]
*  calling the current vaccine recommendations for children, quote, extreme. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=326.98s)]
*  If confirmed as Surgeon General, Means will be responsible for leading [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=331.98s)]
*  thousands of public health officers and communicating key health information to the public. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=335.98s)]
*  At the Federal Reserve yesterday. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=340.98s)]
*  What does your gut tell you about how things are evolving out there? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=347.98s)]
*  My gut tells me that uncertainty about the path of the economy is extremely elevated [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=351.98s)]
*  and that the downside risks have increased. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=357.98s)]
*  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that interest rates will stay the same for now [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=362.98s)]
*  as he waits to see the full economic impact of President Trump's policy changes. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=366.98s)]
*  We don't have to be in a hurry. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=371.98s)]
*  The costs of waiting to see further are fairly low, we think. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=373.98s)]
*  So that's what we're doing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=377.98s)]
*  Powell said it wasn't totally clear how the Fed should try and manage the economy going forward. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=379.98s)]
*  On one hand, it might decide to lower interest rates to try and encourage spending [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=384.98s)]
*  if the economy slows down because of Trump's plans for mass deportations and huge federal budget cuts. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=389.98s)]
*  On the other hand, the Fed might want to raise interest rates if new tariffs cause a spike in inflation [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=395.98s)]
*  and officials feel the need to try and rein it in. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=400.98s)]
*  The next announcement about the rates will come in June. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=403.98s)]
*  And finally, Asia Wilson is widely acknowledged as the best player in women's basketball right now. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=411.98s)]
*  Oh, what a rejection from behind. Wilson, down but not out. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=424.98s)]
*  She's won just about every award and title possible from the NCAA to the WNBA to the Olympics. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=429.98s)]
*  But there was one iconic marker of stardom that she hadn't reached until now, her own signature basketball shoe. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=436.98s)]
*  Here's a Wilson on top, top, top, can't take her spot, spot, spot. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=443.98s)]
*  This week, Nike released the A1, Wilson's first line of sneakers. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=449.98s)]
*  Some say it's way overdue. More than two dozen active men's players have signature shoes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=454.98s)]
*  But Wilson is one of only a handful of WNBA stars with a sneaker deal. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=460.98s)]
*  Brands like Nike and Adidas launched a few shoes from WNBA stars in the 90s and through the early aughts. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=465.98s)]
*  Wilson, though, is the first black player in the league to have a shoe drop in over a decade. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=471.98s)]
*  And on Tuesday, the first batch of A1s in hot pink sold out in minutes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=476.98s)]
*  It's proof that WNBA stars can move shoes too. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=481.98s)]
*  Another player, Sabrina Younescu, released a unisex shoe with Nike two years ago. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=485.98s)]
*  That design is now one of the most popular sneakers for men in the NBA. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=490.98s)]
*  The sales speak to the growing popularity of the WNBA and its stars. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=495.98s)]
*  Viewership numbers have skyrocketed recently. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=499.98s)]
*  Top players like Wilson, along with Kaitlyn Clark and Angel Reese, have signed major apparel deals. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=502.98s)]
*  And arenas have been selling out. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=508.98s)]
*  At a Nike event for her new shoe, Wilson told reporters, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=510.98s)]
*  quote, It's time for people to have a shoe and see a shoe from someone like me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=514.98s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=522.98s)]
*  And on The Daily, how the recent air traffic control outage at Newark has exposed a new crisis in US airline safety. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=524.98s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=532.98s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVhnDr2j83w&t=537.98s)]
