# Fed Expected to Cut Rates, and C.E.O. Shooting Suspect Branded Terrorist
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, December 18th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=7.76s)]
*  Today, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates, a sign that officials [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=11.44s)]
*  think their efforts to stabilize the U.S. economy have been working. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=18.92s)]
*  But the question now is, if that will continue. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=23.0s)]
*  After five years of supply chain disruptions and inflation and recession warnings, the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=26.52s)]
*  economy has found a place of some stability. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=34.4s)]
*  Yet the outlook for 2025 is as murky as ever. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=39.56s)]
*  And there's really one reason for that, and it's Donald Trump. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  My colleague Ben Casleman is covering the potential economic consequences of the policies [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  that Donald Trump has been floating. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=54.82s)]
*  Tariffs, mass deportations, and tax cuts. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=57.02s)]
*  He says the Fed will be watching to see which of those Trump follows through on, and so [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=60.7s)]
*  will investors. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=65.22s)]
*  A lot of investors on Wall Street are banking on a pretty rosy scenario. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=67.22s)]
*  They expect Trump to focus on tax cuts and deregulation, things that would be good for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=72.3s)]
*  corporate profits. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=79.02s)]
*  But it's not at all clear that they're right about that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=80.5s)]
*  And I talked to economists who think it's much more likely that Trump will impose steep [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=84.62s)]
*  tariffs and start another trade war, that he will be more aggressive on immigration [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=91.54s)]
*  than Wall Street seems to be anticipating. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=97.22s)]
*  And in a worst case scenario, that could result in reduced investment, in a shortage of workers, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=100.26s)]
*  and ultimately in higher prices and slower growth. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=107.0s)]
*  None of that is remotely guaranteed, and the positive scenario remains very plausible. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=111.86s)]
*  But that's kind of the point. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=120.08s)]
*  The outlook for the future remains as uncertain as ever. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=121.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=131.14s)]
*  Immigrant advocates are racing to help undocumented immigrants and their families prepare for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=134.54s)]
*  the crackdown that Trump has promised. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  In southern Texas alone, there are thousands of people living without authorization. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  Many of them settled there years ago, they have children who are U.S. citizens, and have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=153.1s)]
*  largely not been targeted by authorities. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  But now, with Texas officials offering to help the Trump administration round people [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=160.6s)]
*  up, fear is spreading. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=165.16s)]
*  One advocacy group is holding trainings, acting out possible scenarios to teach people how [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=170.68s)]
*  to respond if they're stopped for questioning. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=175.26s)]
*  My colleague Edgar Sandoval recently sat in on one of those sessions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=177.44s)]
*  The first sketch was basically designed to show them everything they could do wrong, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=181.48s)]
*  For example, a man playing a police officer stops a woman. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=187.72s)]
*  The woman playing the migrant basically divulges that she's lacking identification, that she [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=191.08s)]
*  doesn't have car insurance. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=196.16s)]
*  And that was the first red flag, according to the activist. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=198.12s)]
*  He said, when you do this, what you're really doing is giving the police permission to call [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=200.72s)]
*  for Border Patrol for backup because they have a suspected undocumented immigrant. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=205.44s)]
*  So he explained that they have a right not to answer questions, the right to call an [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=209.7s)]
*  immigration lawyer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=215.2s)]
*  Another important plan that they were told about was to secure power of attorney in case [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  they get deported and the children stay behind. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  That way their children can be adopted by a legal relative instead of ended up in foster [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=225.1s)]
*  care. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=231.38s)]
*  Even though they learned all this, there was still a lot of fear amongst the group. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=233.6s)]
*  One man raised his hand and said, why don't we just pack our bags and voluntarily go [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  back home? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  Why are we waiting for us to be picked up one by one? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  That was his fear. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=248.62s)]
*  But a lot of them walked away feeling at least that they can have some sort of plan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=249.62s)]
*  We say a bit more about the charges. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  They include one count of murder in the first degree as a killing and further of terrorism, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=263.26s)]
*  two counts of murder in the second degree. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=269.62s)]
*  The District Attorney of Manhattan announced yesterday that Luigi Manjone has been charged [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=273.46s)]
*  with first degree murder in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=277.46s)]
*  And he classified Manjone's alleged actions as terrorism. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=281.54s)]
*  So in its most basic terms, this was a killing that was intended to evoke terror. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=285.18s)]
*  This was not an ordinary killing, not to suggest that any killing is ordinary. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=293.5s)]
*  But this was extraordinary. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=298.9s)]
*  Others are arguing that the brazen shooting on a Manhattan sidewalk in front of a busy [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=301.06s)]
*  hotel was intended to intimidate the public, therefore meriting the charge. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=304.86s)]
*  If convicted, Manjone faces a life sentence without parole. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=310.42s)]
*  He was also indicted on additional murder and weapons charges. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=314.1s)]
*  He's set to appear in a Pennsylvania courtroom tomorrow for hearing about his extradition [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=317.24s)]
*  to New York. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=321.46s)]
*  The U.S. has a homeowners insurance crisis, and it's getting worse. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=322.85999999999996s)]
*  As climate change has increased the risks of wildfires, flooding, storms, insurance [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=335.62s)]
*  companies have had to pay out, getting claim after claim from people whose homes have been [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=340.46s)]
*  damaged or destroyed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  Facing major losses, some insurance companies have stopped renewing policies. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=346.62s)]
*  Last year, Congress demanded that the country's largest insurance companies share data on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=352.66s)]
*  where this is happening and how often. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=356.7s)]
*  The congressional report is now out, and it shows that non-renewal rates have tripled [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=359.42s)]
*  in at least 200 counties across the country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  There are the expected areas in California and Florida. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=367.98s)]
*  Some insurance companies have pulled out of those states entirely. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=371.46s)]
*  But the dropped policies have also become an issue along the Gulf Coast, in some of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=374.82s)]
*  the plains states, in the Mountain West, and all the way along the Atlantic coast up [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=378.5s)]
*  to New England. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=383.06s)]
*  There is a caveat. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=384.62s)]
*  The data doesn't show why each policy wasn't renewed, so it can't be entirely attributed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=385.78s)]
*  to climate threats. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=390.1s)]
*  But areas deemed uninsurable can see property values plummet. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=391.82s)]
*  That means less tax revenue for schools, police, and other basic services. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=395.94s)]
*  And it's not just a problem for existing homeowners. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=400.78s)]
*  If you can't get insurance, you can't get a mortgage. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=403.46s)]
*  Without a mortgage, most Americans can't buy a home to begin with. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=406.62s)]
*  You can see the full map of where homeowners have been dropped by insurance companies at [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=412.3s)]
*  NYTimes.com. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=416.38s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=423.58s)]
*  Nothing has like cleared, cleared my skin until I saw a TikTok talking about beef tallow. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=424.58s)]
*  Today's hottest skincare trend is beef. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=431.74s)]
*  Specifically beef tallow, which is rendered fat from around a cow's internal organs. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=435.02s)]
*  I put beef tallow on and it's almost like instant relief. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=439.46s)]
*  It's become the sought after ingredient in cosmetics, and for people who make their [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=442.94s)]
*  own skincare products at home. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=447.06s)]
*  I made this yesterday from a big package of ground beef that I got. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  I basically just like cooked it down. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  Users swear by it as a natural organic moisturizer. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=454.58s)]
*  Guys, I don't know if I look glowy or greasy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=458.02s)]
*  Not everyone is on the beef train though, including several dermatology experts the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=462.66s)]
*  Times spoke with. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=466.78000000000003s)]
*  They warned that just because something's natural doesn't mean you should put it on [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=468.3s)]
*  your face. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=471.5s)]
*  There's very little data about tallow as a skincare product, and it could cause acne [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=472.5s)]
*  or other irritation. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=476.86s)]
*  Some farms and butchers are cashing in while the trend lasts though. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=479.06s)]
*  One ranch owner said she sold $42,000 in tallow products in just a few hours, using cow parts [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=483.34000000000003s)]
*  she used to throw away. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=489.66s)]
*  This is, of course, not the first you're putting what on your face beauty phenomenon. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=491.78s)]
*  The snail mucus trend, which is a thing, is still going strong. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=496.82s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=505.17999999999995s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at the rape trial in France that has captivated the country [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=507.05999999999995s)]
*  for months and sparked a reckoning. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=511.73999999999995s)]
*  A verdict is expected this week. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=514.62s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=517.1s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=521.62s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUTilsb6aqo&t=522.62s)]
