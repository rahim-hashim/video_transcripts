# Trump in Saudi Arabia, New Push to Deport Venezuelans, Library of Congress Showdown | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, May 13th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=7.88s)]
*  Early this morning, President Trump received a royal welcome in Saudi Arabia as he touched [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=19.12s)]
*  down for the first stop on his four-day tour of the Middle East. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=23.96s)]
*  For the last 30 minutes of the flight, Air Force One was escorted by Saudi fighter jets [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=28.04s)]
*  and a purple carpet was rolled out on the tarmac in Riyadh, where Trump was welcomed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=33.44s)]
*  by the Saudi Crown Prince. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=38.0s)]
*  Trump, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=40.0s)]
*  will attend a U.S.-Saudi investment conference and a state dinner before continuing on to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=44.56s)]
*  Qatar and the UAE. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=50.2s)]
*  His trip comes at a time when there is a lot of important foreign policy measures at play [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=51.92s)]
*  in the region with different negotiations going on to try to end the war in Gaza. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=58.6s)]
*  There's talks about a new Iranian nuclear deal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=64.8s)]
*  But those aren't really the point of this trip. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=68.92s)]
*  This trip is about one thing, and that is economic deals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=71.5s)]
*  My colleague, White House correspondent Luke Broadwater, is in Riyadh. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=75.64s)]
*  Donald Trump has told his advisors he wants to bring home pledges of $1 trillion in deals [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=79.44000000000001s)]
*  for the United States. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  We don't know exactly what they all will be yet, but we strongly suspect many of them [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  have already been announced and will be sort of repackaged as new announcements for this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=91.72s)]
*  trip so that the president can come home with a large dollar amount that he can sort of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=96.92s)]
*  boast about. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=102.28s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has already pledged to invest $600 billion over four years in the United [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  States. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=110.44s)]
*  Trump has asked them to round that up to $1 trillion. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=112.08s)]
*  That's going to be very difficult for the Saudi government to pull off. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=115.68s)]
*  They just don't really have that kind of cash on hand. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=120.08s)]
*  Now we already know at least one of the deals that will be announced is the State Department [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=123.44s)]
*  has already said that Saudi Arabia plans to buy $3.5 billion in air-to-air missiles [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=127.8s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=134.84s)]
*  So it is very possible there will be deals made. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=136.8s)]
*  But during President Trump's first term visit in 2017 to Saudi Arabia, there were hundreds [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=140.4s)]
*  of billions of dollars announced in investments. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=147.6s)]
*  But an analysis of those shows that fewer than one-fourth of them actually came to fruition. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=151.76s)]
*  So you know, sometimes these big deals don't actually pan out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  Last night, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for permission to deport [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=171.12s)]
*  another group of Venezuelans they've accused of being gang members. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=175.28s)]
*  The court had temporarily blocked the roughly 200 migrants from being deported last month [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=179.6s)]
*  amid a series of legal challenges. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=184.84s)]
*  Now in the filing to the court, the government claims that, quote, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=187.6s)]
*  serious difficulties have arisen with detaining them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=191.28s)]
*  It says that a few weeks ago, about two dozen of the migrants barricaded themselves inside [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=194.9s)]
*  the Louisiana detention facility where they were being held. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=200.16s)]
*  And for several hours, they blocked doors, covered surveillance cameras, and threatened [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  to take hostages. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=207.92s)]
*  The government says the incident is proof the men pose a threat and need to be deported. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=209.56s)]
*  The Times reached out to a lawyer for the men to verify the account and didn't immediately [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=214.84s)]
*  hear back. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=219.08s)]
*  But the filing offers a rare look into what's been happening at the facility. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=220.32s)]
*  Last month, journalists from Reuters flew a drone over it to see where the men were [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=224.96s)]
*  being held and captured photos of a group of detainees using their bodies to spell out [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=228.96s)]
*  the letters S.O.S. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=234.04s)]
*  The Trump administration has claimed the men are gang members who have invaded the U.S., [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=236.72s)]
*  giving the government the authority to deport them without a trial. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=240.96s)]
*  The Times investigation found that an earlier group of Venezuelan migrants who were deported, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=244.08s)]
*  using that same justification, had very few documented links to gang activity, and that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=249.0s)]
*  most of them had no criminal records beyond their immigration offenses. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=254.36s)]
*  Now, two other quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=259.64s)]
*  First, in Washington yesterday, there was a standoff at the Library of Congress, as [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=263.92s)]
*  staff there refused to let Trump administration officials access the building. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=269.0s)]
*  President Trump has appointed Todd Blanche, his former personal lawyer, who's now the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=273.84s)]
*  deputy attorney general, to run the institution after he abruptly fired the previous Librarian [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=283.96s)]
*  Yesterday morning, two of Blanche's deputies tried to enter the complex, holding a letter [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=285.24s)]
*  from the White House saying they were now in charge of some of the library's operations. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=290.52s)]
*  But since the firing, library staff have said they're waiting for direct instructions [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=295.32s)]
*  from Congress on who their new boss is, since the position is supposed to be confirmed by [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=300.24s)]
*  the Senate. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  When the two men showed up, the staff called the library's general counsel and the Capitol [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  police and the men walked away. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=311.64s)]
*  It's not exactly clear what will happen next in the separation of powers showdown. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=314.56s)]
*  In a joint statement, two Democratic lawmakers said, quote, Congress must stand up for Article [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=319.04s)]
*  one of the Constitution and defend the nonpartisan library and the legislative branch from White [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=324.48s)]
*  House political control. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=330.24s)]
*  And in another moment of pushback, earlier this year, American farmers brought a lawsuit [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  against the Trump administration for stripping climate data from the Department of Agriculture's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=338.68s)]
*  website. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=343.24s)]
*  The information included data sets and interactive tools that farmers relied on to plan for heat [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=344.32s)]
*  waves, droughts, floods and other disasters linked to global warming. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=349.56s)]
*  The administration had scrubbed the info as part of its push to purge language related [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=354.08s)]
*  to climate change from federal documents. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  Now the department says it has started restoring the data in response to the lawsuit. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=361.64s)]
*  In California yesterday, it is time to take back the streets. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=373.36s)]
*  It's time to take back the sidewalks. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=377.32s)]
*  It's time to governor Gavin Newsom took a major step in cracking down on homeless encampments. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=379.48s)]
*  He called on cities and towns across the state to effectively ban camping on public property [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=385.16s)]
*  and gave them a legal template to put that ban in place. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=391.2s)]
*  It simply cannot continue. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=394.36s)]
*  It cannot be a way of life. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  California is home to about half of the country's unsheltered homeless population. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=400.04s)]
*  Tents and sleeping bags on the sidewalks have become a constant sight in many places, especially [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  since the pandemic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  Newsom now wants municipalities to clear any camps, pointing to the tens of billions of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  dollars his administration has spent on housing and mental health services to address the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  issue. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=420.48s)]
*  There are no more excuses, Newsom said in a statement. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=421.48s)]
*  As one of the most well-known Democrats in the country, Newsom pushing to outlaw encampments [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=425.32s)]
*  suggests that the Democratic Party's approach to homelessness may be shifting. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=430.28s)]
*  In the past, many liberals have been against any actions that could be seen to punish those [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=434.8s)]
*  without shelter. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  But frustration has been rising. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=440.68s)]
*  According to a recent poll, nearly 40% of California voters said they were so tired [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=443.08s)]
*  of encampments overtaking parks and sidewalks that they supported arresting people if they [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=448.2s)]
*  refused shelter. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=453.6s)]
*  Newsom's proposed ban doesn't specify any criminal penalties like that, but many advocates [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=456.04s)]
*  for the homeless still object to clearing encampments. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  They say it can traumatize vulnerable people and just moves the problem around. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=464.6s)]
*  Close one camp and another pops up. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=469.36s)]
*  Other critics of Newsom's plan pointed to an ongoing shortage of shelter space and said [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  California needs even more housing and treatment options than the governor has pushed for. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=476.92s)]
*  And finally, there's been a breakthrough in flamingo research, which is a thing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=489.98s)]
*  If you've ever seen a flock of flamingos eating their food, it is a whole showy operation. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=495.56s)]
*  They dip their long necks all the way down, dunk their heads underwater, and then shuffle [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=501.16s)]
*  their feet in this weird splashy cha-cha tap dance while they scoot around. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=505.82s)]
*  It looks really goofy, but scientists have now cracked exactly what the birds are up [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=510.74s)]
*  to. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=516.02s)]
*  The research shows that flamingos are not just hunting and pecking, hoping for snacks. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=517.02s)]
*  Instead, they are active predators who harness physics to sweep up their prey. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=521.46s)]
*  High-speed cameras captured how, by quickly pulling their heads back, the birds can create [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=527.76s)]
*  a tornado-like vortex in the water that sucks in small crustaceans and insects. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=533.42s)]
*  And flamingos' beaks are specifically shaped to get those mini tornadoes to flow directly [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVNe0O3fA8o&t=539.68s)]
