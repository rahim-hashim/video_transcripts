# Israel Attacks on Multiple Fronts, and Helene’s Trail of Destruction
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Monday, September 30th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=6.44s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=8.52s)]
*  The Israeli military launched attacks on multiple fronts this weekend, striking targets in Lebanon, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=14.0s)]
*  Gaza, and Yemen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=20.0s)]
*  The strikes come as violence ramps up between Israel and Iran-backed groups across the Middle [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=21.64s)]
*  East, threatening to push all the parties involved into all-out war. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=27.08s)]
*  In Yemen, Israeli warplanes flew over a thousand miles to strike power plants and a seaport [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=32.28s)]
*  after Houthi militants who are based there fired missiles at Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=38.48s)]
*  And in Lebanon, Israel launched a wave of deadly attacks this weekend on the heels of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=43.0s)]
*  its heavy bombing campaign Friday that killed Hezbollah's longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=48.12s)]
*  Nasrallah was considered by many to be the most important militia leader in Iran's so-called [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=54.72s)]
*  Axis of Resistance against Israel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=60.16s)]
*  He led Hezbollah for over 30 years, pushing the message that Israel needed to be eliminated. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=63.4s)]
*  To kill Nasrallah, Israel dropped bombs that flattened three apartment buildings near Beirut [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=69.68s)]
*  that it said were sheltering the group's underground headquarters. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=74.92s)]
*  The prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Sunday that this was all part of a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=78.68s)]
*  strategy to create a new balance of power in the Middle East in which Israel's status [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=86.12s)]
*  isn't questioned. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=91.72000000000001s)]
*  Adam Raskon covers Israel for the Times. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  In other words, the prime minister was saying that he wants these groups, the Iranian-backed [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  groups, to think twice before they attack Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  He said, our foes and friends view Israel again for what it is, a strong, determined [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=107.48s)]
*  and powerful state. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=115.68s)]
*  For the Israeli government, this is a bold strategy going after the most senior leaders [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=117.84s)]
*  of Hezbollah, but it's also a risky one in the eyes of some Israeli officials who say [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=124.84s)]
*  Hezbollah is battered. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=132.6s)]
*  It is sort of shocked by everything that's happened over the past two weeks, especially [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=134.16s)]
*  Nasrallah's killing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=139.64s)]
*  But no one should make a mistake about their capacity to fire hundreds of rockets simultaneously [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=141.5s)]
*  at big Israeli cities in a way that will overwhelm Israel's air defenses and could cause immense [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=149.64s)]
*  damage. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=157.48s)]
*  The escalating violence between Israel and Hezbollah is adding to what's already been [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=158.84s)]
*  a massive amount of upheaval. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=162.68s)]
*  Tens of thousands of Israelis and hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have been displaced [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=165.32s)]
*  from their homes because of the fighting. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=169.62s)]
*  According to the UN, as many as 100,000 people have now fled from Lebanon to Syria because [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=172.2s)]
*  of the most recent airstrikes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=177.08s)]
*  Across the southeastern U.S., rescue and recovery efforts are still underway this morning after [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=185.0s)]
*  Hurricane Helene tore through the region. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=190.0s)]
*  At least 90 people have been confirmed dead across five states, but officials expect that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=193.06s)]
*  number to rise as rescuers make their way deeper into the Appalachian Mountains, where [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=198.28s)]
*  whole towns have been decimated by flooding and landslides. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=203.28s)]
*  The highest death toll has been in North Carolina, where the state's governor, Roy Cooper, says [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=213.56s)]
*  they're racing to deliver supplies to communities that have been cut off. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=218.4s)]
*  Hundreds of roads there have been closed, forcing authorities to use helicopters to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=223.06s)]
*  airdrop in food and supplies. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=226.9s)]
*  Even as the rain and the winds have subsided, the challenge for people there increases. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=229.52s)]
*  People are desperate for help, and we are pushing to get it to them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=236.82s)]
*  What I can see around me, there's lots of downed trees, there's debris all over the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=242.12s)]
*  streets, there is no electricity, there's no water, and there's no cell service. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=245.8s)]
*  Times reporter Eduardo Medina has been reporting from Asheville, one of the North Carolina [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=252.52s)]
*  cities hit hard by the storm. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=256.72s)]
*  Lots of people have been huddling around the few hotels or libraries that still have a [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=259.22s)]
*  Wi-Fi signal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=264.8s)]
*  And what they're trying to do, what they've been trying to do, these residents, is one, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=266.88s)]
*  tell their loved ones they're OK, and two, check with those who they haven't been able [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=270.64s)]
*  to connect with yet. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=274.84s)]
*  And it's sort of been this anxiety-inducing storm because of that, because of the lack [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=276.88s)]
*  of cell service here for many residents. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=282.12s)]
*  In the 2024 presidential race, Kamala Harris started her weekend with a campaign stop at [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=291.32s)]
*  the U.S.-Mexico border, where she delivered one of the Democratic Party's most hard-line [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=296.56s)]
*  speeches on immigration in a generation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=301.96s)]
*  I will protect our nation's sovereignty, secure our border, and work to fix our broken [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=304.8s)]
*  system of immigration. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=314.24s)]
*  She vowed to continue the crackdown on asylum that President Biden began. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=316.24s)]
*  She then held a rally in Las Vegas, where she continued her effort to try and bait Donald [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=320.82s)]
*  Trump into debating her again, telling crowds that she was all in while Trump was, quote, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=325.52s)]
*  ready to fold. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=331.2s)]
*  It was a lucrative weekend for Harris. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=332.96s)]
*  Her campaign says she pulled in $55 million. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, Joe Biden became mentally impaired. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  Kamala was born that way. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=342.32s)]
*  Trump criticized Harris's speech at the border and unleashed a string of personal attacks [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=346.24s)]
*  against the vice president. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=350.96s)]
*  And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=352.56s)]
*  happen to our country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=357.52s)]
*  Anybody would know this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump repeated some of the insults at a rally on Sunday, sparking criticism from the American [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=360.32s)]
*  Association of People with Disabilities and driving several Republican lawmakers to try [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=365.2s)]
*  and distance themselves from Trump's remarks. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=370.76s)]
*  What do you think about that rhetoric? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=373.23999999999995s)]
*  I just think the better course to take is to prosecute the case that her policies are [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=374.23999999999995s)]
*  destroying the country. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=379.28s)]
*  They're crazy liberal. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham and Congressman Tom Emmer, who have both supported Trump, said [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=382.0s)]
*  in separate interviews that they felt he should focus on policy issues. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=386.24s)]
*  With five weeks to go until the election, polls show an exceedingly close race between [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=390.84s)]
*  Harris and Trump. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=395.58s)]
*  At the moment, Harris is ahead by three percentage points in the time's average of national polls. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=397.06s)]
*  Their VP candidates, Tim Walz and JD Vance, will debate tomorrow night in New York City. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=403.08s)]
*  The most ambitious effort yet in the U.S. to regulate artificial intelligence has been [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=412.0s)]
*  vetoed by California's governor. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=420.2s)]
*  The proposed law would have required that large AI systems like CHAT-GPT are tested [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=422.96s)]
*  for safety before being released to the public. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=428.28s)]
*  It would have also required that they have kill switches in case the systems get out [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=430.56s)]
*  of control. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=434.8s)]
*  Because there are no federal laws limiting AI, the California bill would have served [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=436.4s)]
*  as a model for the country. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=440.88s)]
*  The legislation had nearly unanimous support from state lawmakers, but many of the biggest [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=443.08s)]
*  players in tech, like Google, Meta, and OpenAI, opposed it, saying it would have stifled innovation. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=448.24s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom faced an intense lobbying effort in recent weeks from opponents and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  supporters of the proposed guardrails. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  Ultimately, he said the bill focused too much on regulating the biggest AI systems, and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=462.56s)]
*  said lawmakers should send him a new rewritten bill next year. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=468.72s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=478.44s)]
*  Chris Christopherson, the actor and country singer, has died at 88 years old. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=479.4s)]
*  He was arguably most influential because of the songs he wrote for other people. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=499.2s)]
*  Hundreds of artists, from The Grateful Dead to Gladys Knight to Janis Joplin, performed [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=504.4s)]
*  his music. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=508.8s)]
*  Christopherson's literary talent was noticed long before he became famous in Nashville. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=509.8s)]
*  As a college student, he won a Rhodes Scholarship to study English literature at Oxford University. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=526.16s)]
*  While he was in the UK, he took up the pseudonym Chris Carson and tried to make it in the British [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=532.08s)]
*  pop scene. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=537.32s)]
*  That went nowhere. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=539.08s)]
*  But his big break came a few years later at the Newport Folk Festival when June Carter [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=540.7600000000001s)]
*  Cash, Johnny Cash's wife, basically dragged the struggling and very nervous singer-songwriter [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=545.5200000000001s)]
*  on stage with the duo. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=551.08s)]
*  That introduced Christopherson to a national audience. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=553.36s)]
*  And Johnny Cash's performance of Sunday Morning Coming Down, which Christopherson wrote, went [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=556.6s)]
*  on to top the country charts. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  Christopherson also had a decades-long career in Hollywood. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=567.32s)]
*  He acted in more than 50 movies, including the 1970s version of A Star is Born with Barbra [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=585.2s)]
*  Streisand. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=590.44s)]
*  Christopherson won a Golden Globe for his performance, but he always thought of writing [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=591.44s)]
*  as the key to his success. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb0X6IkS1GE&t=604.48s)]
