# Harris Makes Her Final Case, and Trump Seizes on ‘Garbage’
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, October 30th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=6.36s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=8.4s)]
*  So look, in less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=15.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris delivered what her campaign called her closing argument last night in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=22.8s)]
*  Washington, D.C. as American voters decide, Harris or Trump? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=27.36s)]
*  On day one if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=32.6s)]
*  When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=38.72s)]
*  Harris's choice of location for the speech was not at all subtle. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=42.8s)]
*  She stood at the same spot where Trump spoke on January 6th, rallying his supporters, who [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=46.72s)]
*  then marched on the Capitol. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=52.04s)]
*  And throughout her speech, Harris made the case for what she would do if elected versus [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=54.08s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  I will fight to restore what Donald Trump and his hand-selected Supreme Court justices [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  took away from the women of America. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=66.64s)]
*  She pledged to defend abortion rights and help Americans with the cost of childcare [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=70.08s)]
*  and housing with tax credits. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=74.88s)]
*  She also cast Trump as a threat to democracy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=77.62s)]
*  As United States of America, we are not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=81.36s)]
*  The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=90.96s)]
*  That closing argument was all about contrast. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=99.36s)]
*  It was a contrast with Donald Trump both in its setting and it was a contrast in the content [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=102.0s)]
*  of her speech as well. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=107.76s)]
*  Peter Baker, the Times' chief White House correspondent, was at the speech. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=109.44s)]
*  She made a point of laying out specific policies in more detail than she often does and in [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=113.36s)]
*  contrast to Trump, who doesn't talk about policy really at all except in the broadest [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=119.84s)]
*  of generalities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=124.28s)]
*  And it was meant to address critics who say she hasn't been specific enough. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=125.28s)]
*  She presented herself as a problem solver, somebody who's willing to work across the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=129.18s)]
*  aisle to make things better for Americans. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=133.4s)]
*  As opposed to Trump, who is focused in her view on retribution, on attacking enemies, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=136.68s)]
*  on dividing the country. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=143.08s)]
*  And the other thing she wanted to do was to reach out to those uncommitted voters, the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=145.0s)]
*  very few of them who are left, to say this is why it's important for you to come to the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=149.24s)]
*  polls and to support me at this time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=154.12s)]
*  The idea being that she will address their problems rather than the way Trump will only [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  address his own. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=164.98s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign is taking a page out of their 2016 playbook and trying [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=173.3s)]
*  to recreate a moment that hit big with his supporters back then. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=178.94s)]
*  It was when Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters a, quote, basket of deplorables. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=182.9s)]
*  They turned the insult into a rallying cry. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=188.34s)]
*  Now President Biden has provided the ammunition. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=191.54s)]
*  The president was reacting yesterday to remarks from Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=195.06s)]
*  where a comedian called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=200.14s)]
*  The White House claims that what Biden was calling garbage was the demonization of Latinos. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=213.38s)]
*  But. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=218.38s)]
*  Biden stated that our supporters are garbage. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=221.38s)]
*  Trump's allies seized on the soundbite. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=224.5s)]
*  Our garbage. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=227.06s)]
*  He's talking about the border patrol. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=228.46s)]
*  He's talking about nurses. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=230.6s)]
*  He's talking about teachers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=232.18s)]
*  Senator Marco Rubio talked up the remarks at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=234.26s)]
*  And so did Trump himself. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=238.82s)]
*  She said deplorable. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=240.46s)]
*  That didn't work out. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=241.62s)]
*  Garbage, I think, is worse, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=242.62s)]
*  By last night, the Trump campaign had already sent a fundraising email with the subject [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=245.06s)]
*  line, You are not garbage. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=248.94s)]
*  In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a residential building yesterday killed dozens of people, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=258.74s)]
*  the latest in a series of recent strikes there that have caused mass casualties. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=264.22s)]
*  Gaza's health ministry says at least 93 people were killed, including at least 25 children. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=269.26s)]
*  We have reached out to the government of Israel to ask what happened here. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=275.9s)]
*  We don't yet know the underlying circumstances. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=280.38s)]
*  A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said it was a, quote, horrifying incident [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  with a horrifying result and that the U.S. was waiting for answers from Israel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=287.14s)]
*  In recent weeks, Israel has been carrying out a renewed offensive against Hamas in northern [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=297.14s)]
*  It says it's trying to stop militants from regrouping there. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=298.14s)]
*  Civilians in the area are once again caught in the middle. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  According to the United Nations, no U.N. aid has reached northern Gaza since early last [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=305.5s)]
*  week, and an emergency effort to vaccinate kids there against polio, which has flared [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=310.34s)]
*  up in the region, has been put on hold. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=315.5s)]
*  More than 100,000 kids now only have partial protection from the disease, potentially allowing [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=318.46s)]
*  it to spread in Gaza and beyond. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=323.78s)]
*  I have flown over the Amazon many times, and what we either usually see is full green verdant [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=336.26s)]
*  forest or patches of barren land where the trees have been cut down. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  But this was very different. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=348.9s)]
*  What was left was a broad swath of forest that was gray and leafless. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=350.02s)]
*  The trees were still standing, but they were just their corpses. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=355.47999999999996s)]
*  The Times Brazil bureau chief, Jack Nickus, is reporting on a new threat to the country's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  forests. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=364.14s)]
*  The forests are some of the most biodiverse habitat left on the planet, and for years, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=365.38s)]
*  authorities have been trying to fight back against ranchers who clear the woods to raise [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=370.74s)]
*  cattle. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=374.42s)]
*  Authorities have used satellites to look for intentionally set fires or for sections of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=375.98s)]
*  trees that have been clear-cut with chainsaws. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=380.08s)]
*  But Jack says some ranchers have changed their tactics. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=383.42s)]
*  They're now using chemicals to illegally kill off whole sections of forest. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  Not only does it kill the trees, but it also contaminates the soil. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=392.36s)]
*  The chemicals can wash into rivers. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  It affects the wildlife, and it also affects the people who live in the forest in a much [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=399.88s)]
*  more dramatic way. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=404.06s)]
*  In several cases, there have been indigenous communities that have to move their villages [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=405.62s)]
*  because of aerial spraying of chemicals, and in some cases, they've had to actually be [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=410.38s)]
*  evacuated because of symptoms of poisoning. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=414.76s)]
*  Just in the past few weeks, authorities have charged one rancher with spraying chemicals [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=417.66s)]
*  over a stretch of protected forest the size of New York City, 300 square miles, and they [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=423.26000000000005s)]
*  are seeking nearly $1 billion in compensation from this rancher. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=429.18s)]
*  Now this rancher has supplied some of the world's biggest meat packers, and that includes [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=433.86s)]
*  JBS. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=439.14000000000004s)]
*  That's a Brazilian beef giant that exports a lot of meat to the United States. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=440.14000000000004s)]
*  And it shows how a lot of this illegal deforestation has connections to the beef supply chain that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=444.46s)]
*  many Americans buy into. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=453.02s)]
*  Just a couple months into the school year, it's become clear that college sports in the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=463.62s)]
*  U.S. have entered an entirely new era, one with a lot of jet lag. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=467.7s)]
*  Once upon a time, college conferences mostly had a geographic logic to them. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=473.18s)]
*  Schools played other schools nearby, or at least in the same time zone. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=478.38s)]
*  But there's been a massive reshuffling of conferences recently to maximize profits and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=482.42s)]
*  TV deals, and it's created some head-spinning schedules. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  One example, the UCLA football team, which is now in the Big Ten, kicked off in Hawaii [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=491.46000000000004s)]
*  this August. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=496.3s)]
*  When they were in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Nebraska, and up to Washington [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=497.7s)]
*  State. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=503.18s)]
*  In all, the team will travel over 22,000 miles this season, almost enough to circumnavigate [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=504.18s)]
*  the globe. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=510.09999999999997s)]
*  That means student athletes are missing more class and more sleep, and schools are scrambling [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=511.74s)]
*  to adjust. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=516.9s)]
*  Some are adding tutors, mental health support staff, or shifting budgets for more charter [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=518.46s)]
*  flights. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=523.26s)]
*  One Stanford professor told the Times he's concerned about the balance between academics [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=524.72s)]
*  and athletics, which has always been somewhat controversial. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=529.48s)]
*  He said at a certain point, the concept of a student-athlete, quote, gets so stretched [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  that it's broken. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  And finally, for anyone who flies in the U.S., including all of those college athletes, dealing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFISiyq4zP0&t=543.08s)]
