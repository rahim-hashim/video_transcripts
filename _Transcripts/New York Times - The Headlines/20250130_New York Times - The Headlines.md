# A Plane Crash Near Washington, and 3 Contentious Senate Hearings
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Thursday, January 30th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=7.76s)]
*  I'm standing outside along the banks of the Potomac River just south of Reagan National [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=15.6s)]
*  Airport, probably half a mile from where a passenger airplane collided with a military [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  helicopter just a few hours ago. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=28.88s)]
*  My colleague Robert Jemison has been reporting from the Potomac near Washington, D.C., after [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=32.64s)]
*  a passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided in midair last night and crashed into the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=37.2s)]
*  water. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=42.16s)]
*  I see about half a dozen spotlights that have been put up, shining bright lights into the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=43.16s)]
*  water. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=47.44s)]
*  You can see tons of sirens and lights going off, blue and red lights all along the banks [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=48.44s)]
*  of the river there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=52.64s)]
*  There's a ton of news crew. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=54.2s)]
*  The plane was an American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, headed to Reagan National [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=55.4s)]
*  Airport. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=60.08s)]
*  Sixty-four people were on board. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=61.08s)]
*  The helicopter was a Blackhawk on a training flight out of a base in Virginia with three [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  crew members. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=68.08s)]
*  Officials haven't confirmed any casualties, but many are feared to be dead. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=69.88s)]
*  We're told by law enforcement that the plane is in the water in two pieces and they are [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=74.36s)]
*  coming through every inch of the river between the collision site and the airport. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=79.28s)]
*  I talked to one law enforcement official who said there are dive teams en route, but they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=85.08s)]
*  might have to wait until the sun comes up because the conditions are too dangerous to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=89.68s)]
*  enter the water. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=93.48s)]
*  Not only is it dark, but it's also very cold. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=94.68s)]
*  The Times has learned that some of the passengers on board were figure skaters from the U.S. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=99.8s)]
*  and Russia who were heading back from a training camp. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=104.04s)]
*  The International Skating Union released a statement saying it was heartbroken to hear [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=107.48s)]
*  that the flight likely included skaters as well as their families, friends and coaches. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=111.06s)]
*  Mr. Kennedy, you have spent years pushing conflicting stories about vaccines. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=126.48s)]
*  You say one thing and then you say another. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=134.56s)]
*  On Capitol Hill today, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will continue to face questions from the Senate [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=138.12s)]
*  as they consider whether to confirm him as Secretary of Health and Human Services. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  News reports have claimed that I am anti-vaccine or anti-industry. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=148.28s)]
*  I am neither. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=152.28s)]
*  I am pro-safety. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=153.28s)]
*  Kennedy was grilled for three hours yesterday with protesters interrupting him at some points, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=157.28s)]
*  but he appears to have won over most of the Republicans who support he'll need to get [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=162.56s)]
*  confirmed. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=167.04s)]
*  The Senate is also holding confirmation hearings today for two other contentious nominees. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=168.4s)]
*  Cash Patel will be making his case for why he should lead the FBI. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=174.48s)]
*  He's promised to reshape the Bureau by firing its top officials and vowed to go after those [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=179.16s)]
*  who've opposed Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  He previously published a list of people who he said were Trump's enemies. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  And Tulsi Gabbard will be questioned about her qualifications to be director of national [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=190.72s)]
*  intelligence overseeing the country's spy agencies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=195.16s)]
*  Gabbard is a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who broke from her party and embraced [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=199.36s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=204.48s)]
*  If Tulsi Gabbard is confirmed in this role, she'll become one of the most influential [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=205.48s)]
*  advisors to Donald Trump, talking to him every day about critical foreign policy issues. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=210.78s)]
*  Julian Barnes covers national intelligence for the Times. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=218.08s)]
*  He says Gabbard's confirmation hearing today is expected to be rocky. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  Multiple senators, including Republicans, have raised concerns about her lack of relevant [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=225.52s)]
*  experience, and about some of the positions she's taken on foreign policy, including [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  her vocal support of the Russian government. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=235.44s)]
*  Not only is Tulsi Gabbard a defender of Vladimir Putin's positions, she's been actively hostile [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=238.36s)]
*  to Ukraine and has parroted much of what Russia has said to justify their war in Ukraine. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=244.64s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard has also been a supporter of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  in power until rebels drove him out of Damascus. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=259.0s)]
*  She famously went to meet him years after the US had cut diplomatic ties, and while [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=263.76s)]
*  the CIA had a covert program to drive him from power. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=268.56s)]
*  That has raised questions about her judgment, questions about who she has chosen to meet [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=272.6s)]
*  with, and these are the kinds of things lawmakers are going to be pushing her on today. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=278.68s)]
*  Last night, President Trump signed a series of executive orders targeting the country's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  public education system. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=293.68s)]
*  The most sweeping one aims to promote, quote, patriotic education by changing how race, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=296.04s)]
*  gender, and American history are taught in schools. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=302.24s)]
*  It pushes schools to eliminate any instruction about topics like white privilege and unconscious [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=305.76s)]
*  bias, as well as transgender issues. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=310.44s)]
*  It also restarts an effort from Trump's first term to challenge how slavery is taught, and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=313.62s)]
*  to condemn left-wing political movements. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=319.44s)]
*  The order threatens to withhold federal funding from schools that don't comply, but it's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=322.52s)]
*  not clear how much leverage the White House has. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=327.24s)]
*  Ninety percent of public schools are funded by state and local governments, and they're [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=330.24s)]
*  the ones who control curriculums and teaching methods. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=334.48s)]
*  Plus, individual classroom teachers have significant say over what they cover. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=337.44s)]
*  Previous efforts to control the curriculum like this at the state level haven't had [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=342.72s)]
*  much effect, even in some of the most conservative parts of the US. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  Surveys of teachers in states with laws that echo Trump's order show that the majority [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  of them did not change their teaching methods, even after restrictions were put in place. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=356.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the White House has dropped its effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=363.64s)]
*  funding in the first significant reversal by the White House since Trump took office. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  The president had tried to temporarily cut off the money until his administration could [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=374.12s)]
*  root out so-called woke ideology in federal agencies. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=378.08s)]
*  A judge paused the plan, and yesterday the administration withdrew its order altogether. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=382.36s)]
*  Another judge also weighed in, saying the funding freeze was so disruptive that he plans [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=388.0s)]
*  to issue a restraining order blocking the Trump administration from trying similar moves [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=393.12s)]
*  in the future. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=397.76s)]
*  In Israel this morning, people are celebrating the release of another group of hostages who've [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=398.8s)]
*  been held since the October 7 attacks. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=413.44s)]
*  Eight people are being set free by Hamas in exchange for the release of over 100 Palestinian [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  prisoners. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=421.68s)]
*  The trade is part of the fragile ceasefire agreement that has paused the fighting in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=427.2s)]
*  But a new Israeli law that kicks in today could worsen the humanitarian situation for [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  people in the territory. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=433.96s)]
*  The law targets the UN agency known as UNRWA that provides food, water, and shelter to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  millions of Palestinians. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=441.4s)]
*  It bans the group from operating in Israel, making it effectively impossible for UNRWA [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  to continue delivering aid. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  Israel has accused the group of employing members of Hamas. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=451.4s)]
*  UNRWA has fired several staff members amid the claims, but said Israel has provided little [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=454.92s)]
*  evidence to back up its accusation. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=459.6s)]
*  UNRWA says the effect of the ban won't be felt immediately, since it already has several [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  weeks of supplies on the ground in Gaza. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  But the head of the group said that over time the law will, quote, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=469.36s)]
*  immeasurably worsen already catastrophic living conditions. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=472.88s)]
*  And finally, scientists looking at the origins of life in the universe have a long-running [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=485.88s)]
*  debate. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=490.47999999999996s)]
*  Is Earth just special? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  Did this planet just have the perfect combination of exactly the right ingredients and conditions [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  for life to form? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=498.02s)]
*  Or did those conditions exist elsewhere? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=500.92s)]
*  In which case, what other life might be out there? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  A pinch of grit from a distant asteroid is now offering some small clues. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  In a paper published yesterday in the journal Nature, researchers said that they analyzed [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=511.76000000000005s)]
*  dust collected from a probe NASA sent into space. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=516.3000000000001s)]
*  They found that it included organic molecules that are some of the crucial building blocks [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=520.52s)]
*  for life. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=525.0s)]
*  That suggests maybe Earth isn't so unique. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLqDVy9Q6s&t=527.28s)]
