# What to Know About the Chaos in South Korea, and a Major Trans Rights Case
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=4.96s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, December 4th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=8.24s)]
*  I'm Douglas Shoresman and I lead coverage of Asia for the New York Times. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  I'm based in our newsroom in Seoul, South Korea. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=18.56s)]
*  And yesterday seemed to be a pretty calm day and pretty quiet. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=21.88s)]
*  And then it really was not. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=26.92s)]
*  Around 10.30pm, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, the president, Yoon Seok-yul, was suddenly [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=31.28s)]
*  on national television declaring a state of martial law. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=38.18s)]
*  And this wasn't aimed at a foreign power. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=45.32000000000001s)]
*  It was aimed at his own political opponents at home in a very chilling way. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=48.0s)]
*  In a shocking announcement, the highly unpopular president of South Korea, Yoon Seok-yul, accused [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=52.86s)]
*  his opponents of trying to overthrow the country's democracy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=58.58s)]
*  And he appointed an army general who banned protests and declared that he would take control [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=62.34s)]
*  of the media. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=67.42s)]
*  The timing of the decision has struck most as being impulsive and probably not fully [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=68.42s)]
*  baked before he made his move. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=74.14s)]
*  My colleague, Choi Sung-hoon, has talked to people who know President Yoon and have been [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=76.66s)]
*  with him recently. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  And they describe him as a man who's becoming despondent as he grew more politically isolated [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=83.02s)]
*  in recent weeks. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=88.33999999999999s)]
*  Demonstrations calling for his impeachment had been growing day by day. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=90.22s)]
*  Scandals were piling up on him and his wife. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  Suddenly he steps to the mic and shocks nearly everyone. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=97.41999999999999s)]
*  The last time martial law was declared here was 1980. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  That was while the military was still ruling. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=105.41999999999999s)]
*  It scarred a generation that is still very politically active now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=108.1s)]
*  And suddenly for them, it all seemed to be playing out again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=113.14s)]
*  Doug says that after the president's announcement came down, it became a race to reach Seoul's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=118.38s)]
*  National Assembly. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  Troops headed there, some by helicopter. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  So did thousands of protesters defying the army. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  Lawmakers, including some from Yoon's own party, rushed toward the building to try and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=130.66s)]
*  overturn the martial law decree. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=135.34s)]
*  All they needed was a majority to do it, but they needed a quorum inside the National Assembly. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=138.04s)]
*  The police were there trying to hold off protesters, but some lawmakers actually climbed barricades [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  so they could get inside. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=149.23999999999998s)]
*  And in the end, the soldiers didn't make it there until it was too late. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=151.04s)]
*  The vote had happened before they could force their way all the way in. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=154.94s)]
*  And Yoon, he saw it was going against him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=159.0s)]
*  He called off the troops. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=162.48s)]
*  He rescinded the martial law declaration. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=164.16s)]
*  Now the assembly has already moved to impeach him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=167.24s)]
*  That process is underway. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  In the end, martial law only lasted for six hours, but it has tipped South Korea on its head. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  Protesters from around the country have gathered in central Seoul to call on Yoon to resign. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=179.8s)]
*  The official vote on whether to impeach him could come as soon as tomorrow. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  This morning, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over a Tennessee law that bans medical treatments [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=188.2s)]
*  for transgender youth. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=201.23999999999998s)]
*  It's the first time the justices are considering the constitutionality of this kind of law, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  and it comes as Republican-led state legislatures across the country have pushed to limit transgender [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=208.16s)]
*  rights. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=214.12s)]
*  The Tennessee law in question prohibits several types of medical care for transgender minors, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=215.12s)]
*  puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and gender transition surgeries. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  Supporters of the law say they're trying to protect minors from making choices they [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=225.28s)]
*  may not be able to fully grasp. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=228.84s)]
*  But many American medical groups have endorsed youth gender treatments as evidence-based [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=231.16s)]
*  and necessary. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=235.52s)]
*  The case reached the Supreme Court after three families and a doctor challenged Tennessee's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=237.26s)]
*  saying it discriminates against transgender people based on sex. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=243.24s)]
*  The justices ruling in the case, which isn't expected until June, could affect not only [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  Tennessee but about two dozen other states with similar bans. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=251.68s)]
*  I've been speaking to families, parents, transgender children, and transgender adults over the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=256.32s)]
*  last couple weeks. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=262.48s)]
*  Many of the families wouldn't speak unless they were given some form of anonymity because [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=264.1s)]
*  Some of the families have been called child abusers or groomers for trying to understand [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=268.72s)]
*  or seek out this care for their child. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  Others have received death threats and harassment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  My colleague Emily Cochran has been reporting on how the law, which kicked in last year, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=280.48s)]
*  has affected families with transgender children in Tennessee. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=285.32s)]
*  Some families decided they needed to leave right away as a way of ensuring that they [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  could continue to get care for their child or even have the option of considering care [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=293.8s)]
*  for their child. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=300.0s)]
*  There are some families who have chosen to stay. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=301.72s)]
*  They feel that if they use airplane miles or maybe trim the Christmas budget a little [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=304.68s)]
*  bit, they can cover the expenses of going to a state where it is still possible to receive [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=310.72s)]
*  gender affirming care for minors. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=317.68s)]
*  One family told me they waited months just to get appointments in Ohio, and then that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=320.34s)]
*  state passed a similar ban to the one in Tennessee, forcing them to move their care a second time, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  this time to the East Coast. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=331.38s)]
*  With the Supreme Court hearing today, I think a lot of these families are worried that a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=333.88s)]
*  ruling upholding the ban could further embolden state legislatures and the incoming Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=339.74s)]
*  administration to pass even tougher laws aimed at transgender people and where they're getting care. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=346.22s)]
*  In political news this morning, the last House race of the 2024 election has now been called. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=358.54s)]
*  Democrat Adam Gray beat out a Republican incumbent in California's Central Valley by just 187 votes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=364.48s)]
*  That seat flipped for Democrats. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=371.98s)]
*  The final count in the House starting next year will be 215 Democrats to 220 Republicans. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=374.22s)]
*  Looking at Donald Trump's picks for his administration, his choice to lead the DEA, the Drug Enforcement [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=381.94s)]
*  Administration, has withdrawn his name from consideration only three days after getting picked. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=387.62s)]
*  Chad Chronister, a county sheriff in Florida, had come under attack from some of Trump's [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=393.5s)]
*  own supporters for his vigorous enforcement of COVID-19 rules during the pandemic. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=398.1s)]
*  And DEA agents have been circulating a video of Chronister's son rapping about a stabbing [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=404.26000000000005s)]
*  that he served prison time for. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=410.02000000000004s)]
*  In a statement, Chronister said he changed his mind about accepting the nomination after, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=411.82000000000005s)]
*  quote, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=416.62s)]
*  Also yesterday, Trump's transition team announced that it had belatedly signed an agreement [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=417.62s)]
*  to allow the FBI to conduct background checks on Trump's picks for senior roles in his administration. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  They'd previously floated bypassing the FBI altogether and doing background checks through [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=432.85999999999996s)]
*  private investigators instead. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=437.76s)]
*  Still, the FBI background checks that they've agreed to are voluntary, so Trump's picks [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=439.94s)]
*  will get to choose if they want to go through one. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=445.09999999999997s)]
*  It will likely be up to the Republican majority in the Senate to decide if they'll insist [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=447.5s)]
*  on seeing completed background checks before they vote to confirm a nominee. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=452.18s)]
*  And finally, for decades, one of the most popular attractions at American zoos has been [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=462.38s)]
*  the Pandas. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=468.02s)]
*  They're objectively the country's cutest diplomats, and they're officially now on [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=469.02s)]
*  U.S. soil. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=473.9s)]
*  Three-year-old Bao Li walking into his new home for the first time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=474.9s)]
*  And Qing Bao also three years old in her new pool with a big yawn after her long journey [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=478.74s)]
*  from China. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  The zoos get pandas from China through what's billed as a conservation program. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  Zoos pay millions of dollars for the opportunity to host the charming mammals. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=490.82s)]
*  And that money is specifically designated for conservation efforts in China. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=495.34000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. has a federal law requiring that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  But the Times has discovered that is not what's happening. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=503.22s)]
*  What I found shocking was how often the money was spent on things that really had very [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=506.94s)]
*  little connection to conservation in the wild. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=513.7s)]
*  My colleague Mara Vistendahl tracked the money and how it's been spent. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=517.3s)]
*  Money was going to things like apartment buildings and museums and office supplies, computers, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=521.48s)]
*  fax machines, copy machines, and also infrastructure, roads, bridges. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ5OYrj0IKw&t=528.7s)]
