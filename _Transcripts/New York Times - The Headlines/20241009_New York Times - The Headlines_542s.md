# Floridians Rush to Evacuate, and Harris Outlines Home Health Care Plan
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=5.12s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, October 9th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=6.12s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=8.16s)]
*  If you're under evacuation orders, you should evacuate now, now, now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=11.16s)]
*  You should have already evacuated. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=18.04s)]
*  It's a matter of life and death, and that's not hyperbole. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=19.52s)]
*  It's a matter of life and death. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=22.6s)]
*  One of the largest evacuation orders in Florida history is underway as officials try to get [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=25.16s)]
*  as many residents as possible out of the path of Hurricane Milton. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=30.64s)]
*  As of this morning, more than five million people are under mandatory or voluntary evacuation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=35.16s)]
*  orders across the state. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  This could be the worst storm hit Florida in over a century. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=42.04s)]
*  And God willing, it won't be, but that's what it's looking like right now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=45.92s)]
*  Milton is expected to make landfall later today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=50.16s)]
*  Its winds have climbed back up to 160 miles per hour, and it's currently on a path towards [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=52.96s)]
*  Sarasota, south of Tampa, though that could easily change in the coming hours. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=58.44s)]
*  Officials at the National Hurricane Center have warned it could bring catastrophic flooding [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=64.28s)]
*  along a major stretch of the coast. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=68.28s)]
*  Some buildings will wash away. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=70.44s)]
*  Evacuation routes will be quickly cut off. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=72.64s)]
*  We've lost people to storm surge in previous hurricanes who were trying to get out at [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=74.52s)]
*  the last minute, and they drown in their cars. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=78.68s)]
*  So please do not stay in these environment in this unsafe area. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=80.6s)]
*  Get out now while you still can. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=85.24s)]
*  You can follow the latest on the storm's path along with live updates from Florida at nytimes.com. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant was supposed to be in Washington today for an [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=103.72s)]
*  in-person meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, but he's postponed. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=108.48s)]
*  The two were set to discuss how Israel may respond to Iran's recent missile attack. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=114.56s)]
*  The U.S. has been urging restraint. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=119.92s)]
*  Austin told Galant earlier this week by phone the U.S. wants Israel to avoid any step that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=122.64s)]
*  would trigger even more escalation by Iran. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=128.12s)]
*  At a briefing, the deputy Pentagon press secretary declined to say why Galant postponed his trip, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=131.94s)]
*  She rejected the idea that the relationship is frayed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=138.12s)]
*  Is it fair to say that there are kind of tension between both Secretary Austin and Minister Galant? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  No, to the contrary. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I would push back on that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=149.28s)]
*  I don't think there's tension. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=151.4s)]
*  I don't think, you know, you can have, you can have frank, you can have direct conversations [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=152.4s)]
*  with your friends. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=157.6s)]
*  You're not always going to agree on everything. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=158.6s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that there's tensions. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=160.72s)]
*  I wouldn't, I certainly wouldn't read into anything there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=163.48s)]
*  In the last year, the Pentagon has repeatedly backed Israel and sent a wide array of weaponry [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=166.68s)]
*  to the Middle East in support. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=172.16s)]
*  But Pentagon officials have complained that Israel has not been completely candid or timely [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=174.44s)]
*  in telling the U.S. about its plans and operations. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=179.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel and Hezbollah have continued to trade aerial assaults, while Israel also [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=186.28s)]
*  fired rockets into Syria, striking near the Iranian embassy in Damascus. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=191.8s)]
*  Israeli officials tell the Times it was an attempt to assassinate a high-ranking Hezbollah [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  leader there involved in weapons smuggling. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=201.4s)]
*  In recent weeks, Israel has been specifically targeting Hezbollah leadership in airstrikes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=204.0s)]
*  So what I am proposing is that basically what we will do is allow Medicare to cover [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=208.96s)]
*  in-home health care. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=221.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris outlined a new policy proposal on home health care yesterday during a stop [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  at the talk show, The View. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=229.72s)]
*  Harris described a Medicare expansion plan that she said would help people struggling [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  to afford in-home care, either for themselves or their relatives. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=236.4s)]
*  In particular, she said it would help the sandwich generation, adults who find themselves [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=241.24s)]
*  caring for their kids and their aging parents. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=245.8s)]
*  And it's just almost impossible to do it all, especially if they work. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  We're finding that so many are then having to leave their job, which means losing a source [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=255.44s)]
*  of income, not to mention the emotional stress. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=259.6s)]
*  Americans have had to look for in-home care, and that number is expected to grow rapidly [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=264.08s)]
*  in the coming years as baby boomers age. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=268.76s)]
*  One health policy professor who studies long-term care told the Times that it's, quote, the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=272.0s)]
*  biggest gap in Medicare. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=276.6s)]
*  The Harris campaign said the new plan would be paid for by savings Medicare will get from [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=279.24s)]
*  negotiating cheaper drug prices, though it's not yet clear what the total cost would be. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign said he's also supported the idea of covering in-home care. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  A spokeswoman said he would cover it through, quote, tax credits and reduced red tape. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=293.48s)]
*  The FBI has arrested an Afghan citizen in Oklahoma City for plotting a suicide attack [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=304.28s)]
*  on Election Day. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=309.84s)]
*  Nasir Ahmad Tawadi, who came to the U.S. in 2021, is accused of conspiring to carry out [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  an attack on behalf of ISIS with the intent to cause mass casualties. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=316.8s)]
*  It's not clear where he planned to stage the attack, though his online history showed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=322.24s)]
*  he'd visited webcams of the White House and the Washington Monument, according to investigators. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=326.12s)]
*  Tawadi allegedly bought two AK-47 rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammo from an undercover [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=331.72s)]
*  informant for the FBI. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=337.58s)]
*  He was then arrested on Monday when he showed up to a remote ranch in Oklahoma to pick them up. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=339.86s)]
*  The FBI says he also recruited his teenage nephew as a co-conspirator in the plot. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=345.72s)]
*  Tawadi faces charges of aiding a terrorist group and obtaining firearms to commit terrorism, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=351.12s)]
*  which carry a maximum of 35 years in prison, though more charges could be added. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=355.96s)]
*  His arrest underscores the continuing threat posed by the Islamic State and would-be attackers [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=361.76s)]
*  inspired by their anti-American messaging. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=367.04s)]
*  And finally, in Brazil, the social network X, formerly known as Twitter, is getting back [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=372.92s)]
*  up and running after a five-week suspension. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=378.16s)]
*  The site was blocked in Brazil after X refused to comply with orders to take down certain [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=381.48s)]
*  accounts, which the Brazilian Supreme Court said was necessary to protect democracy there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  Elon Musk, who owns X, disagreed, calling it illegal censorship, but he has now complied [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=393.12s)]
*  to get the site back up. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=399.6s)]
*  This is Elon Musk backing down in Brazil, and this is really a defeat for the businessman [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=401.44000000000005s)]
*  because he had really vowed to resist these orders to take down accounts and has completely [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=406.8s)]
*  gone back on that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=413.32000000000005s)]
*  Jack Nickis covers Brazil for the Times. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=414.68s)]
*  He says losing five weeks of business is a big hit for X. Brazil was one of its biggest [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=417.36s)]
*  markets. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  And during the ban, millions of users moved on to alternatives like threads or blue sky [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  and may not come back. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=429.04s)]
*  But beyond the business issue, the showdown between Musk and the court could have wider [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  reaching repercussions. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=436.16s)]
*  The Supreme Court judge at the center of this fight has ordered social networks to take [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=438.24s)]
*  down hundreds of accounts that he says threatens democracy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=442.56s)]
*  He has become kind of the sheriff of the Brazilian internet. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=447.0s)]
*  And now that he had a big tech company capitulate and eventually comply suggests to me that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=449.8s)]
*  There may be no end in sight for his powers and his strategy to continue to censor and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  police what people say online. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=466.44s)]
*  And so Brazil is kind of trying out a new model on how to deal with online speech and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=468.88s)]
*  misinformation. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=474.68s)]
*  And for some, many on the left in Brazil, it's a really exciting new model that is kind [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=476.24s)]
*  of solving what they see as a dangerous threat to democracy from the global far right and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=480.74s)]
*  misinformation. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=486.24s)]
*  But to many on the right in Brazil, and increasingly some government officials in Brazil, this [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=487.76s)]
*  sort of action is posing its own threat to democracy because it's kind of having a single [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=492.8s)]
*  Supreme Court justice say what can be said online and that could be problematic itself. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=497.96s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=509.36s)]
*  The Surgeon General Vivek Murthy put out an advisory. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=511.92s)]
*  What he's saying is that parenting has become so difficult that it's become an urgent public [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=515.88s)]
*  health crisis. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=521.6s)]
*  Claire Kane Miller on how modern parenting became so stressful. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=523.2s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=528.04s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo8yybSipho&t=533.16s)]
