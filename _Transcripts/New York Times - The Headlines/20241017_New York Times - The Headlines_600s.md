# Harris’s Contentious Fox Interview, and Italy Expands Surrogacy Ban
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=5.2s)]
*  Today's Thursday, October 17th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=6.2s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=8.8s)]
*  Madam Vice President, thank you for the time. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=9.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=15.16s)]
*  It's good to be with you, Brett. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=16.16s)]
*  Last night, Kamala Harris sat for the most contentious interview of her campaign so far, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=17.16s)]
*  with Fox News anchor Brett Baer. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=22.88s)]
*  Brett, let's just get to the point. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=24.68s)]
*  Right off the bat, the two sparred over border control. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=26.56s)]
*  We have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  So your Homeland Security secretary said that 85% of apprehensions... [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=33.16s)]
*  I'm not finished. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=36.64s)]
*  Baer repeatedly interrupted Harris, and the whole thing turned into more of a debate than [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=37.64s)]
*  an interview, as they went back and forth over policy and over Donald Trump. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=42.28s)]
*  And that people are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader who spends full-time [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=47.68s)]
*  demeaning and engaging in personal grievances and it being about him instead of the American [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=53.699999999999996s)]
*  people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=61.18s)]
*  People are tired of that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=62.18s)]
*  If that's the case, why is half the country supporting him? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=63.18s)]
*  Why is he beating you in a lot of swing states? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=65.7s)]
*  For Harris, the interview was a chance to make points that most Fox News viewers don't [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=68.66s)]
*  hear in the conservative network's normal programming. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=73.58s)]
*  She talked, for example, about the number of Trump's own former administration officials [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=76.94s)]
*  who now support her instead. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=81.5s)]
*  And Harris tried to distance herself from critiques of the Biden administration. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=84.06s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=88.06s)]
*  My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=90.02s)]
*  And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=101.41999999999999s)]
*  I represent a new generation of leadership. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=104.34s)]
*  Harris did this interview with Bret Baier with one very specific audience in mind, which [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  is Republican women, especially those Republican women who voted for or supported Nikki Haley [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=112.58000000000001s)]
*  in the primary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  Times reporter Nicholas Neyhemos has been covering Harris's campaign. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  And I think one of the most interesting things was her message to these women was not about [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=125.7s)]
*  abortion, which is a big issue for more moderate and liberal leaning women. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=131.82s)]
*  It was about immigration, which polling has shown is a top concern of a lot of female [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=138.34s)]
*  voters. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=145.5s)]
*  So she was able to talk about her plans to secure the border for an audience that likely [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=146.5s)]
*  doesn't get to hear a lot of her message. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=154.45999999999998s)]
*  I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=157.1s)]
*  I've been clear, I think we all are, that it needs to be fixed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=161.58s)]
*  And also these viewers saw her in a much more combative setting. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=166.42s)]
*  The interviews she's done, for the most part, have been very friendly. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=172.34s)]
*  So here they saw her take on someone who was interrupting her frequently, trying to talk [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=176.86s)]
*  over her and really stand her ground and make her points. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=182.98s)]
*  This is making a big push to reach out to Republicans. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=189.74s)]
*  So we'll see how successful this was because a lot of these viewers are skeptical of her. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=195.34s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump held a town hall last night with Latino voters who posed questions [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=201.94s)]
*  to the former president, though Trump often skirted them and avoided answering some, instead [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  retreating to standard campaign language. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=213.86s)]
*  Remember these two things. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=217.02s)]
*  I had the strongest border in the history of our country and had the best economy in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=218.02s)]
*  the history of our country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=222.74s)]
*  And I had no inflation, no inflation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=223.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=227.66000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=228.66000000000003s)]
*  The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has agreed to pay over $880 million to people who say [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=239.34s)]
*  they were sexually abused as children by Catholic clergy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  The record-setting settlement will be divided among roughly 1,300 people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=249.22s)]
*  In total, the LA Diocese, which is the largest in the U.S., will have now paid over $1.5 [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=253.86s)]
*  billion in sex abuse lawsuits. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  It's sold off real estate, liquidated investments, and taken out loans to cover the staggering [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  costs. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=268.1s)]
*  The diocese archbishop said in a statement that he hoped the latest settlement would [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=269.22s)]
*  provide, quote, some measure of healing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=273.08s)]
*  A lawyer representing some of the plaintiffs said the settlement is not full justice, but [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=276.28s)]
*  will give survivors a sense of closure. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=280.64s)]
*  There are still pending lawsuits elsewhere in the state. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  The president of the watchdog group that tracks abuse reports related to the church said, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=286.44s)]
*  quote, there are a lot more dominoes in California to come down. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=291.24s)]
*  Lawmakers in Italy have passed a new law banning citizens from using surrogacy services outside [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=303.4s)]
*  the country. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=309.4s)]
*  The legislation adds to the country's already strict laws which ban the procedure in Italy. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=310.84s)]
*  Supporters of the law say it's designed to protect women from being exploited by surrogacy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=317.4s)]
*  But critics say it's an attack on LGBTQ families, since it's now virtually impossible for gay [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=322.56s)]
*  couples to legally have children there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=328.4s)]
*  The law ban in Italy is only open to heterosexual couples. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=331.68s)]
*  Italy is also one of the few European countries that does not recognize same-sex marriage. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=335.4s)]
*  The new law is seen as a victory for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Maloney, who's been [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=340.64s)]
*  trying to appeal to her conservative base on cultural issues by cracking down on gay [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  rights and abortion. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=350.08s)]
*  The law will also be a blow to heterosexual couples facing infertility issues. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=352.32s)]
*  They are believed to be the majority of people in Italy who are using surrogacy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=357.32s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is speaking to European leaders in Brussels this morning, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=366.12s)]
*  and again making the case that Ukraine needs more support from its Western allies. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=371.0s)]
*  Zelensky says that support is crucial to helping Ukraine turn the tide after weeks of losing [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=376.2s)]
*  ground to Russia. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=381.4s)]
*  They've seen losses not just on the front lines in Ukraine, but the Ukrainian military [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=382.96s)]
*  has also struggled to hold onto the Russian territory it seized this summer. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=387.52s)]
*  The Ukrainian offensive into Western Russia clearly lifted the spirits of people in Ukraine. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=392.28s)]
*  Finally, they had their moment. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=399.44s)]
*  They showed the world that they could still have the initiative on the battlefield and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=401.4s)]
*  achieve success. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=406.32s)]
*  Now, two months into the offensive, the harsh reality of the war has crept in. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=409.24s)]
*  Times reporter Konstantin Mea is in Ukraine covering the war. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=416.04s)]
*  Now the issue is that every Russian village that they regain sort of diminishes the prospect [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  that the Ukrainians can use that territory in order to push the Russians into peace negotiations. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=428.72s)]
*  So to be sure, the Ukrainians still hold something like 300 square miles of territory in Russia [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  that is down from about 400 square miles at the beginning of their offensive. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  But everybody wonders to what extent they'll be able to hold territory there in the next [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=447.68s)]
*  few months in the face of what looks to be intensified Russian counterattacks. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=453.24s)]
*  And finally, Liam Payne, who rose to fame as a member of One Direction, one of the best-selling [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=458.92s)]
*  boy bands of all time, died at 31 yesterday after falling from a hotel in Buenos Aires. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=470.48s)]
*  The circumstances of his fall are unclear. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=477.44s)]
*  Payne was a teenager when his music career took off. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=480.44s)]
*  He and four other contestants in the singing competition, The X Factor, were packaged into [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=483.88s)]
*  a group in 2010 by Simon Cowell, the notoriously critical British music executive and TV host. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=488.68s)]
*  Boy bands weren't a new formula, but One Direction became a massive hit with an adoring [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=495.56s)]
*  audience of teenage girls. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=500.6s)]
*  The Times review of one of the band's early American concerts said, quote, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=503.0s)]
*  There was nothing security could do about the screaming. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=507.08s)]
*  Payne was one of the group's standout singers. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=511.12s)]
*  You're insecure. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=513.64s)]
*  Don't know what for. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=515.6s)]
*  You're turning heads when you walk through the door. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=517.6s)]
*  Don't need makeup to cover up. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=521.6s)]
*  One Direction had 29 hits on Billboard's Hot 100, including What Makes You Beautiful, and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=526.6s)]
*  they released five albums before the group broke up in 2016. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=532.56s)]
*  The members went on to pursue their own solo careers. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=536.6s)]
*  Payne talked openly about how the fame and early success had affected his life. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=540.0400000000001s)]
*  He said security would sometimes just keep the band members tucked away in their own [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEv5NqsMvvY&t=544.36s)]
