# Secret War Plans Shared in Group Chat, and U.S. Food Banks Scramble
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, March [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=0.0s)]
*  25th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=7.44s)]
*  A serious leak of secret U.S. war plans has rattled Washington. On Monday, the White House [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=13.92s)]
*  confirmed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive military information in a [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=19.62s)]
*  group chat that mistakenly included a journalist. The chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=24.92s)]
*  contained operational details on military strikes the U.S. was planning against Houthi [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=31.92s)]
*  rebels in Yemen. Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=36.540000000000006s)]
*  high-level officials were all in the chat. But so was Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=42.6s)]
*  of The Atlantic. Yesterday, Goldberg published an article describing how he'd been added [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=48.64s)]
*  to the chat, apparently by accident, by National Security Advisor Michael Waltz. He said at [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=53.44s)]
*  first he thought it was a fake thread or someone trying to trick him. But as he watched the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  messages roll in over the course of a few days, he realized he was watching the Trump [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=63.44s)]
*  administration debate in real time whether they should strike the Houthis. Once they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=67.92s)]
*  decided to move forward, Hegseth shared highly sensitive information in the chat about how [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=73.08s)]
*  the mission would be carried out hours before the U.S. struck multiple targets in Yemen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=78.44s)]
*  After Goldberg laid out the timeline in his story yesterday, including portions of the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=84.42s)]
*  texts, National Security officials were floored. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=88.92s)]
*  I was over at the Pentagon and people's heads were just exploding. They just couldn't believe [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=92.02s)]
*  that Mr. Hegseth, the Defense Secretary, had put such descriptions of upcoming strikes, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  the kinds of weapons that would be used, the timing for this, where the strikes would take [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  place, all in some chat group. Revealing operational war plans before they actually [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=107.6s)]
*  happened could have also put American troops directly into harm's way. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=113.24s)]
*  Eric Schmidt covers National Security for the Times. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=118.0s)]
*  The big thing to know here is not only was a journalist, Mr. Goldberg, inadvertently [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=120.6s)]
*  included in the group chat, but the conversation also took place outside of the secure government [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  channels that would normally be used for classified and highly sensitive war planning. We don't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=131.18s)]
*  know exactly the consequences of this yet. We don't know if there perhaps were other [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=136.44s)]
*  conversations that were also carried out on signal, which could be exposed to hacking [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=141.52s)]
*  by American adversaries. This breach may reflect the inexperience of this National Security [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=146.2s)]
*  team in coordinating and speaking about very serious military operations. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=152.72s)]
*  When asked about the group chat by reporters, Hegseth said, quote, Nobody was texting war [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=160.28s)]
*  plans. The White House, meanwhile, acknowledged that the chat existed and defended it, calling [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=165.4s)]
*  it a, quote, demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=171.02s)]
*  officials. The incident could trigger a congressional investigation. And several Defense Department [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=175.52s)]
*  officials told the Times that having this type of classified conversation in a non-official [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=181.4s)]
*  channel could be a violation of the Espionage Act, a law covering the handling of sensitive [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=186.56s)]
*  information. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=192.04s)]
*  In New York, immigration officials are trying to find, arrest, and potentially deport another [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  Columbia student over her participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  Yoon Seo-chang is a junior at the school. She moved to the U.S. from South Korea when [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  she was seven and is a legal permanent resident. But the Trump administration is arguing that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=217.14s)]
*  her presence in the U.S. hinders its foreign policy goal of halting the spread of anti-Semitism. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=222.02s)]
*  It's the same rationale that was cited in the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=228.66000000000003s)]
*  grad and permanent U.S. resident who's currently being held at a detention center in Louisiana. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=232.72s)]
*  ICE officials have visited several locations looking for Chung, including her parents' [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=238.66000000000003s)]
*  house, and they searched her housing on campus earlier this month. Her lawyers say she's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=242.94s)]
*  but wouldn't say where. Yesterday, her legal team sued President Trump and other high-ranking [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=248.98s)]
*  administration officials, asking a judge to bar the government from detaining or deporting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  her. Her suit also asked the judge to bar the government from trying to deport any other [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  non-citizens over speaking out at protests. The government's pursuit of Chung underscores [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=264.5s)]
*  how the Trump administration is prioritizing the detention of pro-Palestinian demonstrators [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=270.7s)]
*  and how it's opened a new front in its targeting of immigrants by going after people who are [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=276.7s)]
*  in the country legally. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=281.24s)]
*  Two months since Donald Trump took office, the impacts of many of his administration's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=288.76s)]
*  drastic firings and budget cuts are reverberating across the country. Here are two updates on [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=293.42s)]
*  how the cuts are affecting some of the most vulnerable Americans. The Times has learned [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=299.48s)]
*  that food banks have been scrambling after multiple programs that help keep them running [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=304.58s)]
*  have been abruptly paused or eliminated. Food bank officials say they were counting on hundreds [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=308.94s)]
*  of truckloads of food that have now been suspended, everything from milk and cheese deliveries [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=314.18s)]
*  in New Mexico to chicken and vegetables that were slated for Maryland. The officials say [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=318.7s)]
*  rural areas where food insecurity is particularly high will be the hardest hit. And... [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=323.86s)]
*  The government's actions for drug addiction and mental illness is now facing drastic cuts. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=334.5s)]
*  My colleague Jan Hoffman has been covering the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=339.5s)]
*  Administration, the agency that runs the national crisis hotline and supports clinics that offer [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=343.46s)]
*  opioid treatment programs. Jan says SAMHSA has gone from having 10 national offices to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=349.1s)]
*  just four, and it's abruptly stopped coordinating with local nonprofits who do things like distribute [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=354.66s)]
*  Narcan. And she says broader reductions to its staff and operations could be coming. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=360.34s)]
*  Cutting that staff and potentially the billions of dollars the staff administers throughout [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=366.46s)]
*  the country could lead to a surge in relapse rates, a strain on the health care system, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=372.62s)]
*  and poor health outcomes overall. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  In the West Bank, the Palestinian director of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=388.18s)]
*  Land was beaten near his home by Israeli settlers and then detained, according to witnesses. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=392.98s)]
*  One witness told the Times that at least 20 masked people descended on a village in the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=399.66s)]
*  West Bank last night and assaulted the residents there as they were breaking their fast for [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=404.06s)]
*  Ramadan. The director, Hamdan Bilal, was attacked with rocks, sticks, and knives. Israeli forces [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  then responded and detained Bilal. A statement from the Israeli military said it was holding [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=415.18s)]
*  several Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks. Bilal's film, which he co-directed [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=420.3s)]
*  with three others, documents the demolition of homes in the West Bank by Israeli forces. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  No Other Land took the top documentary prize at this year's Oscars. But despite that, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  and a string of good reviews, no U.S. distributor picked it up, potentially because of how politically [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=437.1s)]
*  charged the topic is, making it nearly impossible for Americans to see the film. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=442.26s)]
*  And finally, it's the first full week of spring. Cue the green leaves and the flowers [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=455.8s)]
*  and the pollen. People who suffer from seasonal allergies know this time of year as the beginning [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=460.98s)]
*  of Kleenex season. But some adults who've never had a problem before may find that they're [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=466.06s)]
*  sneezing and sniffling too. That's because you can develop allergies as an adult. One [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=470.82s)]
*  allergy researcher told the Times that while people tend to think of allergies as something [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=477.06s)]
*  you have from the time you're a kid, it's actually very common to develop them in your [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=481.42s)]
*  twenties, thirties, and forties. Scientists aren't sure exactly why that happens, but [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=485.62s)]
*  there are a couple potential causes. For one, climate change is causing allergy season to [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  start earlier and last longer, which could make people more prone to developing symptoms. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=495.8s)]
*  Another reason? Some infections, like colds, can compromise and change your body's response [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=501.98s)]
*  to allergens. Also, living in the same place for a long time can factor in. Prolonged exposure [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=507.48s)]
*  to the same irritants like pollen can increase the risk of allergies. To be clear, not every [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=514.34s)]
*  runny nose means you have allergies. You'll need more than a few sneezes to know for sure. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=520.64s)]
*  But if you are just entering the allergy club, you are not alone. An estimated one in four [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=526.36s)]
*  adults in the U.S. suffers from seasonal allergies. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=531.44s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, Times reporter Jim Rutenberg explains how [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=538.12s)]
*  President Trump is taking on the media in a way no American president ever has before. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=543.84s)]
*  He's been making it increasingly clear. He wants it entirely, either out of his way or [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=550.2s)]
*  solely serving his interests. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=557.0400000000001s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=559.84s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4MnosSDaA&t=564.24s)]
