# Inside Trump’s Deportation Push, and the U.S. Holds Talks With Hamas
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=4.96s)]
*  Today is Thursday, March 6th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=7.76s)]
*  It turns out we didn't need new laws. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=13.88s)]
*  We didn't need fancy legislation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=15.76s)]
*  We just needed a new president of the United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=17.2s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance was at the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday to highlight a drop in border [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=20.68s)]
*  crossings. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  The number of migrants apprehended at the border is now the lowest in more than two [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=27.32s)]
*  decades. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  But Vance was on the defensive about another part of the administration's hardline immigration [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=32.24s)]
*  policies — the rate of deportations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=37.16s)]
*  Let me say a few things about that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=40.44s)]
*  So, first of all, Rome wasn't built in a day. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=41.8s)]
*  Trump campaigned on the promise of the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=44.04s)]
*  But despite a spike in arrests, the U.S. government has been deporting fewer people than last [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=49.44s)]
*  year. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  I guarantee it is a part of the president's priorities. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=56.08s)]
*  We'll keep on working on it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=58.04s)]
*  We've made a lot of progress, but we're going to keep on working on it over the remainder [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  of the president's term. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  This lag in the pace of deportations has already caused concern, even frustration, among some [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  of President Trump's top immigration advisers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  My colleague Zolan Kano-Youngs has been reporting on how there's increasing pressure on Trump's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=76.19999999999999s)]
*  immigration team to follow through on the president's campaign promises. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  Our reporting has found that Tom Homan, the czar of this deportation effort, and Stephen [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=85.2s)]
*  Beller, the architect of Trump's immigration agenda, are meeting each morning — sometimes [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=91.12s)]
*  in their office in the White House, sometimes in the Situation Room — and are studying [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=96.0s)]
*  these numbers — deportations, detentions — trying to strategize on ways to ramp up [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=99.78s)]
*  these deportation numbers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=105.56s)]
*  Zolan says Homan and others have run into several obstacles. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=107.68s)]
*  Finding, arresting, and detaining migrants is expensive and time-consuming, and the Department [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=111.12s)]
*  of Homeland Security has long said it's short on resources. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=116.0s)]
*  There's also been a recent push in immigrant communities for undocumented people to keep [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=120.16s)]
*  a low profile and avoid authorities. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=124.0s)]
*  Amid these challenges, Zolan says the administration is discussing new tactics. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=126.92s)]
*  We've discovered what some of these proposals are. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=132.2s)]
*  DHS has gone to the IRS and asked them to turn over addresses of hundreds of thousands [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=135.68s)]
*  of people it wants to deport. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=145.88s)]
*  At this point, it does not seem the IRS has agreed to that request. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=147.84s)]
*  And then also the administration is considering reinstating the practice of detaining immigrant [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=152.8s)]
*  families. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=158.36s)]
*  That's a tactic that came under fire because of concerns around detaining particularly [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=159.36s)]
*  immigrant children and the conditions of some of those facilities. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=164.5s)]
*  All of these are measures not just to ramp up deportations, but in some cases create [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=170.86s)]
*  an environment that's so uncomfortable that immigrants decide to self-deport. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=176.1s)]
*  And it's also a sign of sort of a sense of urgency, the sense of, you know, some might [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=182.82s)]
*  even say desperation on this administration to get these numbers up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=187.26s)]
*  Now, three other updates on the Trump administration. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=194.98s)]
*  They requested the call. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=197.9s)]
*  They may be asked and the president is happy to do it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=199.06s)]
*  It's a one month exemption. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=201.78s)]
*  Just a day after President Trump's sweeping tariffs against Canada and Mexico kicked in, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=203.42s)]
*  he gave automakers a one month reprieve. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=208.78s)]
*  The temporary exemption to the 25 percent surcharge came after the heads of GM, Ford [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=212.34s)]
*  and Stellantis all got on the phone with Trump and told him that the new tariffs would effectively [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=218.14s)]
*  erase all of their company's profits. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=224.02s)]
*  Also yesterday, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote blocked Trump's effort to freeze $2 [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  billion in foreign aid. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=234.58s)]
*  The narrow decision suggests that the court may be more skeptical of Trump's attempts [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=236.94s)]
*  to reshape the government than some expected, considering its conservative majority. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=240.86s)]
*  It's less clear what will happen to the aid itself. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=245.34s)]
*  The court sent the issue back down to a district court, which will hold a hearing today about [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  how much of the funding needs to start flowing again. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=253.02s)]
*  And... [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=258.22s)]
*  The federal government does not exist to employ people. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  It exists to serve people. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  More federal workers are set to lose their jobs as the Trump administration's firing [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=263.5s)]
*  spree continues. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=268.22s)]
*  We'll be making major changes, so get used to it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=269.22s)]
*  The Department of Veterans Affairs says it's planning to reduce its workforce by 80,000 [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=277.22s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers and some of their Republican colleagues are warning that could force cutbacks [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=278.94s)]
*  to VA services. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=284.34s)]
*  Overall, the administration's mass layoffs have disproportionately affected veterans, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=286.18s)]
*  who make up 30% of civil service employees. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=291.74s)]
*  In the Middle East, the U.S. has broken with its own long-standing policy and held talks [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=295.22s)]
*  directly with Hamas to discuss the release of hostages from Gaza. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  For decades, American officials had refused to engage directly with groups that the government [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=313.98s)]
*  labeled terrorist organizations. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=318.54s)]
*  But this week, a representative from the White House has been quietly meeting face-to-face [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=321.22s)]
*  with Hamas members in Qatar. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  They've been negotiating the release of five Israeli Americans, only one of whom is still [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  believed to be alive. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  It's not clear whether the talks have been successful or what they'll mean for the ongoing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  discussions between Hamas and Israel about extending the ceasefire. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=338.42s)]
*  In American education, there's been a long-time rallying cry. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=342.5s)]
*  College for all. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=355.26s)]
*  The idea that everyone should get a degree. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=356.58s)]
*  Schools, educators, and politicians from both sides of the aisle pushed it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=358.86s)]
*  Billions of dollars were funneled into the effort. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=363.74s)]
*  It was driven in part by data that shows people with bachelor's degrees have a higher median [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=366.1s)]
*  than those with just a high school diploma. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=371.28s)]
*  But 40% of those who start college never finish. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  And over the years, concerns about those dropout rates and about ballooning student debt and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=377.76s)]
*  a changing job market have tempered the view that college is the only path. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  I wanted to see how this shift is actually playing out. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  So I visited schools that are really focused on expanding the options they talk about and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=391.14s)]
*  prepare students for beyond four-year colleges. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=395.94s)]
*  Dana Goldstein covers education for the Times. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=399.52s)]
*  She went to schools that had once been focused on getting as many of their students into [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=402.0s)]
*  college as possible and have since changed their approach. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=405.84s)]
*  Now there's a lot more research on careers. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=410.2s)]
*  So for example, students will choose three career options that interest them and they [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=413.14s)]
*  will research what is the educational path to get there, how many jobs are actually available, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=418.08s)]
*  is this a growing or a shrinking field? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=423.28s)]
*  Some students are encouraged to look into jobs that might not require four years of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=425.94s)]
*  college. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=430.98s)]
*  So one student I spoke to had three totally different things to look into. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=431.98s)]
*  One was being a real estate broker, one was becoming a police officer, and the one was [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=436.2s)]
*  being a car mechanic. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=441.3s)]
*  And these were equally sort of attractive to her. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=443.26s)]
*  And as you can see, they're really, really different from one another. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=446.22s)]
*  Still, this is a really fine line for the teachers, principals, and education leaders [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=450.74s)]
*  who are engaged with this work. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=455.02000000000004s)]
*  Educators are themselves highly educated. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  Many of them have master's degrees and they're wary of telling kids not to pursue their biggest [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=459.58000000000004s)]
*  dreams, not to reach for the four-year degree. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=466.26s)]
*  I think there's also a really pressing concern that this not go too far. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=470.38s)]
*  The United States has a difficult history of closing the doors to higher educational [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=475.26s)]
*  achievement to low income students, students of color, even girls. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=480.3s)]
*  And many educators I spoke to want to make sure this doesn't swing too far in the wrong [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mP0brCE_ig&t=485.62s)]
