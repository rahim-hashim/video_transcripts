# U.S. to Send Troops to Israel, and a Splintering Democratic Coalition
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=5.2s)]
*  Today is Monday, October 14th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=6.2s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=8.68s)]
*  The Pentagon has announced it's sending an advanced missile defense system to Israel, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=13.72s)]
*  along with 100 American troops to operate it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=18.76s)]
*  It's the first deployment of U.S. troops to Israel since October 7th. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=22.12s)]
*  In a statement, the Pentagon said the goal is to help Israel defend against any further [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=26.88s)]
*  ballistic missile attacks from Iran, which launched about 200 missiles at the country [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  earlier this month. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=35.64s)]
*  The U.S. decision to send the missile system comes as senior Pentagon officials have been [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=37.68s)]
*  debating whether the increased American military presence in the Middle East is containing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=41.96s)]
*  the conflict, like they hope, or inflaming it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Several Pentagon officials have expressed concerns in recent weeks that Israel feels [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  comfortable carrying out an increasingly aggressive campaign against Hezbollah, Iran's most powerful [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  ally, because they know that nearby American warships and attack planes are standing at [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  the ready to blunt any Iranian response. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  According to a senior U.S. military official, it will take at least a week to get the new [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  missile system and the American troops to Israel. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=74.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, Hezbollah carried out a drone strike on an Israeli military base over the weekend, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=79.0s)]
*  killing four soldiers and wounding dozens more. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  The strikes being interpreted in Israel as a sign of resilience from Hezbollah, which [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=87.72s)]
*  has not stopped its cross-border attacks, even as Israel has pummeled southern Lebanon [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  with deadly airstrikes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  The Hezbollah drone attack also raised concerns in Israel about troubling gaps in the country's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  air defense systems. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=104.8s)]
*  Three weeks out from Election Day, the New York Times polling average shows Kamala Harris [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=106.8s)]
*  and Donald Trump essentially tied across the seven key battleground states. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=118.36s)]
*  But the Harris campaign is facing a complicated path to victory. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  Polls from the Times and Siena College show Black and Latino voters drifting away from [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=128.84s)]
*  the Democratic Party in notable numbers. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=133.88s)]
*  Times political reporter Jenny Medina says the results represent a changing reality for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  the Democrats. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=142.48s)]
*  For decades now, Democrats have really counted on diversity as helping them, as helping them [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=143.48s)]
*  be key for support and really believe that as the country became more diverse, they would [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=147.84s)]
*  have a solid majority. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=153.2s)]
*  They thought that would be even more true with Trump, who had made so many comments [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=155.44s)]
*  that people viewed as offensive. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=160.2s)]
*  But instead of repelling those voters, Trump has actually attracted them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=162.72s)]
*  And we're seeing more support for him among Latino voters, which started in 2020, and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=166.64s)]
*  now among Black voters. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=171.96s)]
*  And that's of course particularly interesting as Kamala Harris is the candidate, because [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=173.84s)]
*  she would be the first Black and South Asian woman in the White House. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=177.88s)]
*  And it's interesting to see that for a lot of people, this idea of representation doesn't [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=181.88s)]
*  seem to resonate. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=186.24s)]
*  In Coachella, California this weekend, a man was arrested and accused of illegally possessing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=193.72s)]
*  a shotgun and a loaded handgun as he tried to get into a Trump rally. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=199.56s)]
*  It's not clear what his motives were. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=204.16s)]
*  In a joint statement, the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Secret Service, and the FBI said [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=205.88s)]
*  they've determined the former president was not in any danger. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=210.36s)]
*  The man, identified as Vem Miller, 49, of Las Vegas, got through one level of security [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=214.28s)]
*  but was stopped at a second level before Trump arrived at the venue. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=220.0s)]
*  What we do know is he showed up with multiple passports with different names, an unregistered [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=224.48s)]
*  vehicle with fake license plate, and loaded firearms. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=231.76s)]
*  The Riverside County Sheriff said Miller appeared to consider himself a sovereign citizen, part [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=235.98s)]
*  of a far-right fringe group that believes government laws don't apply to them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=241.16s)]
*  Miller has since been released on bail, according to the county's online inmate information [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=245.92s)]
*  system. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=250.11999999999998s)]
*  And Miller said in a local news interview that he was shocked he was arrested. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  He said he supports Trump and was unfamiliar with California's gun laws. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=255.44s)]
*  On today's episode of The Daily, a Times investigation into the Secret Service and how its failure [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=261.36s)]
*  to protect Trump from the assassination attempt in July exposed even larger issues within [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  the agency. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=271.96s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=273.96s)]
*  Earlier this year, a Times investigation into sugar production in India showed that workers [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=284.96s)]
*  in the state of Maharashtra are being subjected to a brutal system of labor. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=290.52s)]
*  There's so much pressure to keep working that many women are getting unnecessary hysterectomies [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=295.32s)]
*  just so they don't lose time to medical checkups or dealing with their periods. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=301.6s)]
*  After the Times investigation came out, the U.S. Department of Labor added Indian sugar [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  cane to its list of products made with forced labor. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  But on the ground, the practices have continued. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  Our team has been reporting on the sugar industry in Maharashtra for more than a year now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  And the question that kept coming up is why nothing has changed despite the fact that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=325.24s)]
*  many of these abuses are an open secret. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=330.04s)]
*  Megha Rajagopalan is an investigative reporter for the Times. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=332.6s)]
*  One thing we wanted to look at is this question of who actually benefits and who profits from [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=336.12s)]
*  these abuses. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=340.8s)]
*  And what we found is that the group of people that has the power to make and enforce laws [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  that could directly benefit laborers is also deeply enmeshed with the sugar industry. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=348.04s)]
*  And those politicians often control the very sugar mills that they are charged with regulating. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=354.16s)]
*  So reforming or changing the links between the state's elite political class and the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=359.64s)]
*  sugar industry would require a really systemic reform and something that would completely [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=364.52s)]
*  change the industry. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=370.84s)]
*  Megha says that as long as there are customers and therefore profits, conditions in Maharashtra [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=372.32s)]
*  aren't likely to change. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=378.08s)]
*  International brands including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo all buy sugar from mills there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=380.68s)]
*  Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi pledged this year to look into abuses identified in their supply [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=386.08s)]
*  chains, but they have not yet provided any details on what steps they've taken. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  And finally, for decades space travel has relied on rockets that were mostly one and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=403.24s)]
*  done. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  They'd cost tens of millions of dollars to make, you'd get one good launch out of them, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  and then they'd be toast. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=413.44s)]
*  SpaceX has been trying to change that, finding ways to reuse rocket boosters to make the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=416.0s)]
*  industry more efficient and cost effective. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=420.4s)]
*  This weekend the company pulled off a major technical feat in that effort. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=423.76s)]
*  Booster, ship, avionics power, climb to the nominal. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=427.79999999999995s)]
*  That is the sound of 33 Raptor engines. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=431.28s)]
*  It launched one of its Starship vehicles, and then we are go for catch. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=433.4s)]
*  The rocket booster dropped away, falling through the sky at supersonic speeds. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  Look at the entry. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  That's six and a half minutes that it's moving so fast. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=444.4s)]
*  Look at how hard it is. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=446.76s)]
*  Ignition. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=448.56s)]
*  It fired its engines to slow itself as it approached the ground and navigated right [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=449.84s)]
*  into two mechanical arms, nicknamed Chopsticks, ready to catch it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=454.88s)]
*  We have successfully caught the super heavy booster back at the launch tower. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  Rocket booster successfully landed right back in Boca Chica, Texas where it started. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  The head of NASA congratulated SpaceX for the successful launch and catch. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=474.32s)]
*  NASA is relying on SpaceX to get astronauts to the moon for its Artemis mission. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=479.2s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=489.24s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=490.76s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8cmtD4Azsw&t=491.76s)]
