# Gaetz Ethics Report Blocked, and the Trial That’s Horrified France
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, November [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=0.0s)]
*  21st. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=7.44s)]
*  House Republicans have voted to block the release of a potentially damning report about [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump's pick for attorney general. The House Ethics Committee had been [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  investigating the former Republican representative for years over a slew of allegations ranging [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=23.64s)]
*  from sexual misconduct to illicit drug use. After an hours-long meeting yesterday, all [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=29.28s)]
*  of the Republicans on the committee voted not to share what they'd found, arguing that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=35.2s)]
*  because their report wasn't complete, it should stay under wraps. The decision sets [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  up a potential clash with the Senate, where both Democratic and Republican senators have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=44.36s)]
*  asked to see the committee's findings before they vote on whether to appoint Gaetz as [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  the country's top law enforcement official. One Republican suggested the Senate might [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=53.88s)]
*  even subpoena the House Ethics Committee to get the report. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=59.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Times has obtained one of the pieces of evidence the committee had access [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  to, a chart showing a web of payments made on Venmo between Gaetz, dozens of his friends, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=72.44s)]
*  and associates of his, who allegedly took part in drug-fueled sex parties. Notably, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=79.16s)]
*  the chart documents payments from Gaetz to two women, who reportedly testified to the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=84.6s)]
*  committee that he'd hired them for sex. The complex diagram was drawn up by federal [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=89.0s)]
*  investigators when they were considering charging Gaetz for allegedly having sex with a 17-year-old, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=93.96s)]
*  charges that were ultimately never filed. The document doesn't show any payments from [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=100.0s)]
*  Gaetz to the teenager, though it does show that one of Gaetz's friends, who was charged [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=104.6s)]
*  and pleaded guilty to sex trafficking, did send her hundreds of dollars. Gaetz has vehemently [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  denied any wrongdoing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=115.22s)]
*  From a moral perspective, we cannot turn a blind eye to one of the worst humanitarian [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=118.36s)]
*  disasters in the modern history of this world, a humanitarian disaster that we are significantly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=135.36s)]
*  funding. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=144.22s)]
*  In the Senate yesterday, Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, pushed for a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=145.8s)]
*  series of measures to block U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. He argued that ongoing shipments [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  are violating American laws that prohibit sending arms to countries that break international [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=157.08s)]
*  laws or cut off the flow of humanitarian aid. The measures were overwhelmingly rejected, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  but 17 Senate Democrats and two independents showed support for the effort, considerably [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  more than previous similar votes. It's a sign of growing frustration inside the Democratic [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=174.64s)]
*  Party about how Israel is carrying out the war in Gaza, where it's been accused of numerous [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=179.94s)]
*  human rights violations. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=185.04s)]
*  Also in Congress yesterday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson backed a move from far-right [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=191.14s)]
*  lawmakers to require that single-sex restrooms on Capitol Hill only be used by people of, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=196.54s)]
*  that biological sex. The effort was designed to target Sarah McBride, a newly elected House [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Democrat and the first openly transgender person elected to Congress. In response, McBride [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=209.38s)]
*  said she would follow the new rules, quote, even if I disagree with them, and said the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=215.42s)]
*  restrictions were an effort to distract from the real issues facing the country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=220.16s)]
*  For the past 10 weeks, there's been a court case in the South of France that has transfixed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=227.16s)]
*  and really shaken the country. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=236.98s)]
*  Catherine Porter covers France for the Times. She's been reporting on the closing arguments [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=239.56s)]
*  that started this week in the staggering case of Gisele Pellico. Pellico's now ex-husband [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  is accused of drugging her and for years inviting other men to their home to rape her while [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=250.16s)]
*  she was unconscious. He recorded much of it on video. Fifty men are now on trial. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=255.16s)]
*  Catherine says the case has sparked a reckoning in France over what some say are cavalier [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  attitudes towards sexual violence. Many of the defendants have claimed they're not responsible, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  even as the videos of them have been played in court. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=272.32s)]
*  I've been watching this case throughout the weeks from the courtroom, and one really remarkable [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=275.08s)]
*  thing that has resonated across the country is Gisele Pellico and her poise, her dignity, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=280.98s)]
*  her calm in the courtroom. She made this very brave and unusual decision to open this trial [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=288.5s)]
*  to the public, and every day people line up starting right after 6 a.m. to be able to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  witness this and applaud her as she walks in and as she leaves the courtroom. She has [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  barely been in tears. She has barely been angry. She has managed to keep a complete [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=308.78s)]
*  calm and poise. In fact, one of the things she said early in the case was that she wanted [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  shame to change camps, to change sides, that it shouldn't be the victim that feels ashamed. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=319.46s)]
*  It should be the accused. And she has literally embodied that concept. Each day walking in, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  not breaking down in court, and leaving to cheers of women who have come from around [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=331.88s)]
*  the south of France in order to witness this trial, many of them say that they have faced [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=338.06s)]
*  rape themselves and they feel this huge catharsis to be able to watch it, someone else's trial, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=343.56s)]
*  watch it happen in the public eye, unfold, and to hear this reckoning that's happening [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  because she opened the door to her own horror. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  The U.S. government has asked a federal judge to force Google to sell off Chrome, its popular [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=369.02s)]
*  web browser. The request is part of the government's antitrust lawsuit against Google. This summer, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=375.02s)]
*  the judge found that Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search, and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  he asked the lawyers who brought the case to present solutions. The Justice Department [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=385.85999999999996s)]
*  didn't stop at Chrome. It also made other requests, including that the judge give Google [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  a choice, either sell off Android, its smartphone operating system, or stop making Google products [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=395.3s)]
*  mandatory on phones that use it. Taken together, these are the most dramatic requests in a [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  tech antitrust case since the government tried unsuccessfully to break up Microsoft in 2000. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  And they're among the worst-case scenarios for Google. Chrome is the most popular web [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=414.38s)]
*  browser in the world. Android is the most popular smartphone software, so they're a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=419.5s)]
*  huge part of Google's elaborate ecosystem that keeps people using Google's products. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=424.22s)]
*  A Google executive called the proposals extreme and wildly overbroad. The company has to present [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=429.82000000000005s)]
*  its own solutions to correct the monopoly next month. Ultimately, the judge won't rule [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=436.06s)]
*  on the issue until the middle of next year, so any major Google shakeup is a ways off [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  if it happens. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  And finally. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=455.22s)]
*  We're going to begin at $800,000. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=456.22s)]
*  Last night, a highly conceptual piece of art went on the auction block at Sotheby's. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=459.22s)]
*  One million is with me already, actually. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=465.22s)]
*  Bidders from around the world threw their offers into the mix. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=467.22s)]
*  At 3,500,000. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=470.22s)]
*  They pushed the price higher and higher until the winner clinched it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=471.22s)]
*  It's slipping through the auction room at 5,000,000, and I'm going to sell it here, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=475.22s)]
*  the world's most expensive banana, at 5,200,000. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=479.22s)]
*  A real ripe banana taped to the wall with duct tape sold for $5.2 million, plus another [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=483.22s)]
*  million in fees. The piece is by the artist Maurizio Catalán, and it's titled Comedian. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=489.22s)]
*  We are looking at an ordinary banana and an ordinary piece of duct tape. However, what makes [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=495.22s)]
*  the ordinary extraordinary is the intention of the artist who put this together. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=500.22s)]
*  Sotheby's head of contemporary art called Catalán a brilliant provocateur, and he has a [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=504.22s)]
*  history of shocking the art world. He once installed a solid gold toilet at the Guggenheim. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=510.22s)]
*  He first debuted the banana duct tape piece a few years ago and said it was a satirical [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=515.22s)]
*  commentary on the art market and what art is considered valuable. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=520.22s)]
*  The winning bid last night came from Justin Sun, a crypto entrepreneur who watched the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=524.22s)]
*  auction from Hong Kong. He said for him, the piece bridges the worlds of art, internet [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=529.22s)]
*  memes and cryptocurrency. And he said he plans to eat the banana. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=534.22s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, a man from Venezuela who had entered the US [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=545.22s)]
*  illegally was found guilty yesterday in the murder of the nursing student Laken Reilly. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=551.22s)]
*  A look at how her death fed into the heated national debate over border security. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=556.22s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=562.22s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaOdmXcOuf8&t=567.22s)]
