# Harris Outspends Trump in Ad Battle, and Israel Bombards Hezbollah
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amelia Nirenberg. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=4.72s)]
*  Today's Friday, September 20th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=6.48s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=8.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris's presidential campaign has unleashed an avalanche of digital advertising [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=14.76s)]
*  and is outspending Donald Trump's team by tens of millions of dollars. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  New data shows what that looks like in practice. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=24.76s)]
*  In the weeks surrounding the debate, Trump spent about $600,000 for ads on Instagram [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=27.24s)]
*  and Facebook. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=32.16s)]
*  That same week, Harris spent $12 million, 20 times as much. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=33.44s)]
*  That's in part because she has more cash. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=38.44s)]
*  She raised twice as much as Trump in July and August after jumping into the race. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=41.28s)]
*  It also reflects different strategies by the campaigns. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Harris is pressing hard on social media, which could draw in younger supporters or undecided [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=49.12s)]
*  voters. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=53.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump, a former network TV star, has privately said that he thinks digital [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=54.92s)]
*  spending is a waste and he's urged his campaign to spend more on television ads, even though [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=59.76s)]
*  his advisors credited a Facebook-centered strategy with helping him win in 2016. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=64.68s)]
*  A spokeswoman for his campaign told the Times that he doesn't need to spend as much as [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=70.32s)]
*  Harris online because voters are choosing to watch content about Trump on their own. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=74.56s)]
*  But the gap has summoned his party worried. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=79.78s)]
*  One Republican digital strategist warned, quote, we just can't afford to abandon a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=81.86s)]
*  platform to Democrats. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=86.02s)]
*  In North Carolina, one of the country's most competitive races for governor has been jolted [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=94.86s)]
*  by revelations about past comments made by the Republican nominee. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=99.82s)]
*  On Thursday, CNN reported that Mark Robinson, who's currently the state's lieutenant governor, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=104.38s)]
*  called himself a Black Nazi and defended slavery and comments on a porn site. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=109.34s)]
*  Robinson, who's been a vocal opponent of transgender rights, also posted about how [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=113.78s)]
*  he enjoyed transgender pornography. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=118.26s)]
*  The Times hasn't independently verified the comments, which CNN says were written between [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=120.94s)]
*  2008 and 2012. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=125.14s)]
*  Those are not the words of Mark Robinson. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  You know my words, you know my character, and you know that I have been completely transparent [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=130.66s)]
*  in this race and before. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=135.3s)]
*  In a video posted before the article was published, Robinson called CNN's reporting, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=137.34s)]
*  quote, salacious tabloid trash. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=141.9s)]
*  He vowed to stay in the race and the North Carolina Republican Party is standing by him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=144.62s)]
*  But the inflammatory comments could have implications beyond just the governor's race. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=149.72s)]
*  Both Trump and Harris are fighting to win North Carolina. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=154.04s)]
*  Part of the reason that North Carolina is in play in the presidential election may in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=157.78s)]
*  fact be because Trump endorsed Mark Robinson during the Republican primary. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=163.5s)]
*  Jess Bidgood is a Times political reporter. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=170.22s)]
*  He called him Martin Luther King Jr. on steroids, even though he knew at the time that he was [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=172.74s)]
*  a controversial candidate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=178.14s)]
*  Robinson was someone who had made comments widely viewed as sexist, as anti-Semitic, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=180.28s)]
*  as anti-LGBTQ. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=186.18s)]
*  Trump endorsed him anyway. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=188.34s)]
*  Robinson went on to win the primary and he has been trailing the Democratic candidate [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=190.52s)]
*  in the polls. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=194.52s)]
*  And that may actually be having kind of a dragging effect on Trump's own performance [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=195.52s)]
*  in North Carolina. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=201.52s)]
*  It's a state that Republicans usually win in presidential elections, but this year it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=203.02s)]
*  is looking potentially closer than ever. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=208.72s)]
*  And so this controversy there may just make it even harder for Trump to win a state that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  is absolutely critical to his ability to be elected president. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=220.24s)]
*  Trump's campaign has not directly addressed Robinson's comments. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  One person close to the campaign told the Times it's not planning to call for him to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=229.62s)]
*  drop out, though it may distance itself from him. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump is scheduled to visit North Carolina tomorrow. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=236.38s)]
*  In Lebanon, the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has made his first public remarks [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=240.04s)]
*  after the militant group was hit by an audacious attack that blew up their pagers and walkie-talkies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=255.16s)]
*  Nasrallah said the explosions, which killed dozens of people and injured nearly 3,000 [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  The attacks spread tremendous fear across the country as people worried that any electronic [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=267.12s)]
*  device that they had in their homes, in their houses, in their pockets, in their backpacks [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=274.12s)]
*  could suddenly be transformed into a bomb. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=278.0s)]
*  Times reporter Ben Hubbard has been reporting on the aftermath of the attacks. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=280.8s)]
*  Ben says Lebanese authorities have banned people from bringing pagers into public buildings [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=284.88s)]
*  and onto airplanes, and that the army has been collecting and detonating suspicious [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=289.2s)]
*  devices. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=293.52s)]
*  The widespread attacks have also strained Lebanon's health care system. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=294.76s)]
*  Many people interviewed in hospitals, talked about how their loved ones had lost fingers, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  had lost eyes, had had parts of their faces blown off. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=304.48s)]
*  Hezbollah was clearly the target of the attack. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=308.92s)]
*  Of the 37 dead, Hezbollah did claim many of them as fighters and mourn them as such. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=311.26s)]
*  But we know that there were also at least three children. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=316.32s)]
*  And then among the wounded, it's complicated because Hezbollah does have a large fighting [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=318.76s)]
*  force, but it also has a large apparatus that does effectively civilian types of operations. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=323.4s)]
*  You know, they have schools, they have political offices, they do social services. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=328.84s)]
*  And so there's good reason to believe that many of these people were also injured in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=333.76s)]
*  the attacks. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=337.92s)]
*  We've never seen this kind of attack that hit so many people in such a kind of a personal, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=339.4s)]
*  intimate way. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=343.88s)]
*  And for that reason, it's very difficult to anticipate what Hezbollah's response might [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=345.6s)]
*  be. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  In his speech yesterday, Nasrallah vowed retribution against Israel, which defense and intelligence [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=353.4s)]
*  officials say carried out the plot. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any involvement. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=361.44s)]
*  Hours after Nasrallah spoke, Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes against Hezbollah, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=365.12s)]
*  one of its most intense bombardments of the group this year. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=370.12s)]
*  The markets closed at record highs yesterday after the Fed announced its decision to cut [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=372.84s)]
*  interest rates for the first time in four years. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  The S&P 500 made a 1.7% gain, breaking a record it set in mid-July. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=387.84s)]
*  The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit its highest point ever. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=393.79999999999995s)]
*  The drop in interest rates was a good sign for investors, since lower borrowing costs [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  can boost corporate profits and increase the value of their holdings. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=402.18s)]
*  But at the same time, investors are weighing whether the Fed's move is a sign that it's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=405.74s)]
*  worried about the labor market. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=409.46s)]
*  Fed officials are now forecasting that the unemployment rate could go up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=411.58s)]
*  And finally, it's the end of the Tupperware era. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=422.98s)]
*  This week, the legendary plastic container company filed for bankruptcy, saying it had [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  fallen more than a billion dollars into debt. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=431.68s)]
*  Hear that? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=434.12s)]
*  That's Tupperware's airtight promise to lock in flavor and lock out air. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=435.12s)]
*  Tupperware's takeover of the American kitchen started after World War II, when Earl Silas [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=440.52s)]
*  Tupper invented a way to use leftover plastic to preserve food. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=445.24s)]
*  The girls get together and meet their old friends and make some new ones. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=449.2s)]
*  Then there's a demonstration. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=453.52s)]
*  His products took off after a marketing whiz named Brownie Wise launched Tupperware parties, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=455.52s)]
*  where women sold the products to each other. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=461.02s)]
*  Tupperware became a household name, but eventually that might have been part of its downfall. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=463.94s)]
*  When the original patent expired, other companies rushed in to profit on the airtight design. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=468.94s)]
*  And even though they weren't official Tupperware products, everyone still called them Tupperware. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=474.85999999999996s)]
*  In the marketing world, that's what's known as genericization. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=480.29999999999995s)]
*  Think Kleenex instead of facial tissue, or Ziploc for sealable sandwich bags. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=483.52s)]
*  But unlike other companies, Tupperware never figured out how to protect its brand. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=489.58s)]
*  The company is now closing its only remaining factory in the U.S. and laying off workers. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=494.14s)]
*  But its name, our leftovers, and many cabinets full of mismatched plastic lids will live on. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=499.53999999999996s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=508.14s)]
*  Today on The Daily. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=509.14s)]
*  With just 46 days left until the election, Time's political reporters Maggie Haberman, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  Shane Goldmacher, and Nate Cohn discuss the state of the race. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=515.7s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnVohI2jG1Y&t=520.38s)]
