# New Orleans Attack ‘Inspired by ISIS’, and a Cybertruck Explosion in Las Vegas
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=0.0s)]
*  2nd. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I know I can speak for all Americans when I say our hearts are with the people of New [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=14.8s)]
*  Orleans after the despicable attack that occurred in the early morning hours. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=19.48s)]
*  President Biden addressed the country last night in the wake of a deadly New Year's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=25.66s)]
*  attack in New Orleans. At least 15 people were killed and dozens injured after a man [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=29.12s)]
*  driving a pickup truck veered around a police car and plowed into crowds out celebrating [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=34.6s)]
*  on Bourbon Street. The normal barriers protecting the street, famous for its nightlife, were [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=39.84s)]
*  in the process of being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl, which the city's hosting [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=44.96s)]
*  next month. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=48.68s)]
*  The FBI has reported to me the killer was an American citizen born in Texas. He served [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=49.68s)]
*  in the United States Army and active duty for many years. He also served in the Army [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=56.72s)]
*  Reserve until a few years ago. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=61.28s)]
*  The driver has been identified by the FBI as Shamsa Dinbahar-Jabbar, a 42-year-old man [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=63.54s)]
*  from the Houston area. After the crash, he opened fire at police officers and was killed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=68.12s)]
*  in the shootout. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=72.98s)]
*  The FBI also reported to me that mere hours before the attack, he posted videos on social [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=73.98s)]
*  media indicating that he was inspired by ISIS, expressing a desire to kill, desire [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=80.08s)]
*  to kill. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=87.08s)]
*  The Times has been looking into Jabbar's background. He had no violent criminal history. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=88.24s)]
*  Those close to him described him as quiet and intelligent, though the husband of his [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=92.92s)]
*  ex-wife said he'd been acting erratically in recent months. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=96.68s)]
*  If Jabbar's connections to the Islamic State are confirmed, this would be the deadliest [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=99.72s)]
*  attack in the U.S. connected to the group since the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=104.46s)]
*  which killed 49 people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=109.56s)]
*  My colleague Eric Schmidt covers counterterrorism for the Times. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=111.2s)]
*  Over the last several years, the threat of an ISIS-spired attack against Americans inside [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=115.04s)]
*  the United States has receded and law enforcement officials have focused more on right-wing [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  domestic terrorism as a greater threat to Americans. But the attack in New Orleans has [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  revived concerns that some kind of international ISIS threat may be growing here in this country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=132.54s)]
*  Officials said that after the attack on Bourbon Street, they found disposed of a number of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=140.36s)]
*  improvised explosive devices in the area and that they don't think Jabbar acted alone. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=145.88000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Las Vegas... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=152.36s)]
*  Do I think it's a coincidence? I don't know. But what I can tell you is we're absolutely [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  investigating any connectivity to what happened in New Orleans, as well as other attacks that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  have been occurring around the world. We're not ruling anything out yet. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=163.72000000000003s)]
*  Officials are investigating a separate incident in which a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=167.16s)]
*  of the Trump International Hotel yesterday. They say the Cybertruck had gas canisters [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  and large fireworks in the back of it when it exploded at the entrance doors of the hotel, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=176.56s)]
*  killing the driver and injuring at least seven others. The truck was rented through the same [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=181.48s)]
*  car rental app as the pickup used in the New Orleans attack. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=185.96s)]
*  Yesterday, the last major natural gas pipeline from Russia to Europe shut down. The pipeline [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=197.16s)]
*  runs through Ukraine. And despite Russia's war against the country, Ukraine had allowed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=205.72s)]
*  gas to keep flowing because of a multi-year contract. But Ukraine's president has now [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=210.48s)]
*  let that contract lapse as part of an ongoing effort to cut Russia's profits from selling [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=215.44s)]
*  gas and undermine its military funding. Across Europe, countries have largely switched away [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=220.16s)]
*  from Russian gas since the war started. But the latest cutoff could still cost Russia $6.5 billion [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=225.68s)]
*  a year. At the same time, analysts warned that Moscow, which has largely held off on attacking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=232.16s)]
*  Ukraine's pipelines, could now start bombing them since they have little incentive not to. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=238.64s)]
*  In the past few years, marijuana use in the US has surged. About 15% of Americans say they [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=243.48s)]
*  smoke marijuana, according to a Gallup poll. That's more than double the number who said they [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=257.28s)]
*  did a decade ago. But experts say there's been a major blind spot in research about the effects [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  of marijuana, namely, how does it impact drivers who get behind the wheel when they're high? Now, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=267.24s)]
*  federal researchers are hoping to fill in that gap, pushing forward with a pair of studies. First, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=273.08s)]
*  they're working to design a portable breathalyzer that could be used to tell how recently a driver [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=278.84s)]
*  used marijuana. Right now, tests can't reliably tell whether someone used it hours ago or days [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=283.44s)]
*  ago. They're also trying to figure out how much is too much. They're paying participants to get [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  stoned and use a driving simulator to see how cannabis use impacts reflexes and motor skills. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  Unlike drunk driving laws that are based on measurable blood alcohol levels, there's still [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=299.8s)]
*  no consensus about what amount of marijuana may be safe for drivers. For the moment, there's a [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=305.24s)]
*  patchwork of laws regulating driving while high. Lawmakers in at least 10 states have prohibited [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=310.08s)]
*  it altogether. But the researcher overseeing the federal studies told the Times, quote, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=315.16s)]
*  Policymakers need data on which to base their policies. And there isn't much data here. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=319.76s)]
*  And finally, In Rome, the Trevi Fountain, made famous in TV, movies, songs, and on Instagram, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=325.56s)]
*  is open again after months of renovation. And the coins are already pouring in. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=342.88s)]
*  The legend goes that if you throw a coin into the iconic 18th century fountain, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=349.76s)]
*  you'll come back to the city someday. It's one of the most popular attractions in Rome, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=356.44s)]
*  so much so that the city's considering charging a fee to visit it. While it was under renovation, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=361.08s)]
*  workers put out what can best be described as a glorified kiddie pool, and people still threw [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  $63,000 of coins into that little tub. All the money that goes into the Trevi Fountain gets [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=371.76s)]
*  donated to a Roman Catholic charity, which uses it for everything from soup kitchens to care [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=378.12s)]
*  programs for people with Alzheimer's. They can rake in over $2 million a year from the coins. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=383.0s)]
*  Workers vacuum out the fountain twice a week using a machine designed for cleaning swimming [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=388.16s)]
*  pools. The charity is then charged with sorting out all the other stuff that gets tossed into [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=393.32s)]
*  the water. Subway tokens, guitar picks, marbles, shells, key rings, foreign currency. For the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=398.6s)]
*  record, they prefer euros, so they don't have to pay an exchange fee. Those are the headlines. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=405.64s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at how the ultimate fighting championship, UFC, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  went from a fringe sport to a phenomenon, and the role Donald Trump played in its rise. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=418.2s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YmmPfE8auw&t=423.59999999999997s)]
