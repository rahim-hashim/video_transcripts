# Netanyahu Unwavering on Cease-Fire, and Putin Visits Mongolia
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, September 3rd. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=8.52s)]
*  After this, we're asked to show seriousness? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=14.56s)]
*  We're asked to make concessions? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=18.68s)]
*  What message does this send Hamas? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  It says kill more hostages, murder more hostages, you'll get more concessions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=23.72s)]
*  Last night, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he will not budge on conditions [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=28.5s)]
*  for a ceasefire, despite facing the biggest protests in Israel since the start of the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=33.46s)]
*  war in Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=38.66s)]
*  Demonstrators had taken to the streets and some workers had gone on strike, grieving [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=40.74s)]
*  and angry, after the bodies of six hostages were recovered from Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  The protesters called on the government to make an immediate deal with Hamas to stop [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=50.34s)]
*  the fighting and secure the release of the remaining hostages. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=54.62s)]
*  But Netanyahu is not backing down. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=59.099999999999994s)]
*  We're out to destroy the military capabilities of Hamas and the governing capabilities of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  Hamas, and we're well on our way to achieving both. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=66.74s)]
*  That is total victory. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=69.64s)]
*  Netanyahu insists that Israel needs to keep troops stationed along Gaza's border with [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=72.17999999999999s)]
*  Egypt, controlling a strip of land there known as the Philadelphia Corridor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=76.62s)]
*  Hamas has said that's a non-starter and that any deal must include a complete withdrawal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=81.9s)]
*  of Israeli troops from Gaza. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=87.30000000000001s)]
*  A spokesman for Hamas's military wing threatened yesterday that if Netanyahu continues his [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=90.18s)]
*  military campaign instead of striking a deal, the remaining hostages in Gaza will return [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  home, quote, inside coffins. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  For 23 years, I was privileged to have the most stunning honor to be Hersh's mama. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=111.9s)]
*  I'll take it and say thank you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=120.42s)]
*  I just wish it had been for longer. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=123.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, in a cemetery in Jerusalem yesterday, the family of Hersh Goldberg-Pollen, one of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=126.94000000000001s)]
*  the six hostages killed in Gaza last week, spoke at his funeral. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=132.46s)]
*  How do we live the rest of our life without you? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  I pray that your death will be a turning point in this horrible situation in which [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=140.9s)]
*  we are all entangled. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=144.84s)]
*  Goldberg-Pollen was a dual American-Israeli citizen, and the Israeli military says they [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=148.06s)]
*  believe seven more Americans are still being held in Gaza, four of them alive. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=152.66s)]
*  Several of their families openly criticized Netanyahu yesterday for not moving urgently [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=158.72s)]
*  enough to secure the release of their loved ones. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=163.28s)]
*  Daddy Alexander, whose 20-year-old son Aiden was taken on October 7th, told the Times that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=166.66s)]
*  a ceasefire deal, quote, has to happen right now, full stop, period. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=171.46s)]
*  More military pressure brings more dead hostages. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=177.38s)]
*  On Monday, President Biden also said that Netanyahu was not doing enough to finalize [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=181.42s)]
*  a deal, and one of Israel's other closest allies signaled its growing frustration with [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=187.68s)]
*  the war in Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=193.3s)]
*  Britain announced that it would suspend the exports of some weapons to Israel, saying [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=195.02s)]
*  there was a clear risk it could be used in violation of international law. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Mongolia this morning. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=210.62s)]
*  It's the first time he's been in any of the 120-plus countries that belong to the International [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  Criminal Court since the ICC put out a warrant for his arrest last March. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=219.76s)]
*  He's accused of committing war crimes related to the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  children. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  The International Criminal Court actually asked Mongolia to honor its commitment as [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  a member and arrest Putin, but what we saw today actually was a red carpet welcome for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=235.94s)]
*  the Russian president. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=242.92s)]
*  Valerie Hopkins covers Russia for the Times. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=244.76s)]
*  She says Putin almost certainly will not be arrested in Mongolia because the country [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=247.6s)]
*  relies on Russia for nearly all of its fuel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=252.22s)]
*  According to the official agenda, Putin is in Mongolia to talk about economic cooperation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=255.72s)]
*  and possible infrastructure projects. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  But actually, the most important purpose this visit serves for him is thumbing his nose [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=264.76s)]
*  at the international community. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=269.92s)]
*  Analysts are saying it's really a symbolic win for him, considering that for the last [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=272.56s)]
*  two and a half years, the West has tried to isolate him to make him into an international [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=277.04s)]
*  pariah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=282.6s)]
*  And here he is saying, you know, look at your Western rules-based order. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=283.6s)]
*  No one's going to arrest me because I'm still too important as a partner and Russia is still [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=288.16s)]
*  too powerful. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  In the U.S., the summer of extreme weather has taken its toll on the country's infrastructure, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=303.48s)]
*  like highways, runways, and in particular, bridges. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=309.36s)]
*  How hot is it? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  The Third Avenue Bridge is stuck in the open position all because of overheating. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  Early this afternoon, crews performing some routine maintenance noticed some buckling [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=320.48s)]
*  on the bridge surface, closing that bridge to traffic. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=324.36s)]
*  Now overnight, a train bridge in Western Iowa collapsed under the pressure of the high water. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=327.04s)]
*  America's bridges were already vulnerable and in need of repair. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=332.12s)]
*  More than a quarter of them were built before 1960. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  But now, record-breaking heat and flooding linked to climate change is causing them to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=338.76000000000005s)]
*  deteriorate faster, according to engineers. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  The bridges often weren't built to withstand sharp temperature swings, which cause materials [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=346.56s)]
*  to swell and contract. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  One civil engineering expert told the Times the hot conditions can make bridges, quote, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=353.6s)]
*  literally fall apart like tinker toys. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  A study published in the journal PLUS One found that high temperatures could cause one [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=361.72s)]
*  in four steel bridges in the U.S. to collapse by the year 2050. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=366.04s)]
*  Another issue is the ground the bridges are built on. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=371.72s)]
*  Heavy rains are eroding the soil around their foundations, which is the leading cause of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=375.12s)]
*  bridge failure in the U.S. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=379.72s)]
*  Updating the structures for modern conditions is both expensive and time-consuming. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=382.92s)]
*  A 2021 bipartisan infrastructure bill put more than $100 billion towards major transportation [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=387.84s)]
*  projects. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  But Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told the Times bridges can take the longest [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  to update. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=400.4s)]
*  And finally, cases of M-Pox, which the World Health Organization declared a public health [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=408.23999999999995s)]
*  emergency last month, are continuing to spread. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=413.67999999999995s)]
*  There have been diagnoses in Sweden and Thailand, but the vast majority have been in African [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=417.8s)]
*  countries, where more than 17,000 people have been infected and 600 have died, mostly children. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  The epicenter of the outbreak is the Democratic Republic of Congo, and officials there say [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=430.16s)]
*  they don't have the resources to contain or even treat the virus. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=434.98s)]
*  In Congolese clinics, doctors say they're short on medications to care for patients [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=439.52s)]
*  covered with the painful lesions that come with M-Pox. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=443.8s)]
*  And they're still waiting on vaccines to protect health care workers and caretakers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=447.76s)]
*  Photojournalist Arlette Boshizi went to a clinic that's been overwhelmed by patients in Kivumu [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=465.72s)]
*  in eastern Congo. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=470.24s)]
*  You could see mothers looking after their kids because they can't leave them alone [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=471.96s)]
*  at the hospital. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=477.23999999999995s)]
*  So even the mothers of those kids are also exposed to the M-Pox. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=479.08s)]
*  One mother I met at the health center had her daughter being treated. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=484.35999999999996s)]
*  She was holding her hand. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  I was like, are you not afraid to also contract this disease? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  And she just told me, I can't leave her alone because I don't want her to die. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=497.24s)]
*  I'll stay here with her. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=502.44s)]
*  And that is like the situation that they are all going through. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=504.92s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=514.36s)]
*  Today on The Daily, why a growing number of schools are banning cell phones. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=515.88s)]
*  You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=521.2s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rWjjxXdhL0&t=525.16s)]
