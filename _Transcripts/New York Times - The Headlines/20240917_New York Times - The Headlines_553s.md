# New Details in the Trump Shooting Plot, and Sean Combs Arrested
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, September 17th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=7.92s)]
*  As former President Trump was moving through the Fifth Fairway, the agent saw the subject [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=13.48s)]
*  armed with what he perceived to be a rifle and immediately discharged his firearm. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=18.28s)]
*  The subject, who did not have line of sight to the former president, fled the scene. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=24.2s)]
*  He did not fire or get off any shots. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=28.88s)]
*  The Secret Service has provided new details about the apparent assassination attempt against [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump at his golf course on Sunday, fueling new questions about the agency's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=36.96s)]
*  ability to do its job. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Cell phone records show that the suspect got to the golf course in the middle of the night [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=44.68s)]
*  and stayed there undetected for almost 12 hours before he was spotted hiding in the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=48.72s)]
*  bushes with a rifle. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  At a press conference yesterday afternoon, the acting director of the Secret Service, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=55.32s)]
*  Ronald Rowe, admitted agents did not search the perimeter of the course before Trump started [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=59.28s)]
*  golfing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=64.32s)]
*  Still, Rowe defended the agency's methods as, quote, effective. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=65.32s)]
*  The agent's hypervigilance and the detailed swift action was textbook. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=69.24s)]
*  And I commend them and our partners for an exemplary response in keeping former President [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=73.8s)]
*  Trump safe. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=78.6s)]
*  Other law enforcement officials, meanwhile, including former Secret Service agents, are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=80.18s)]
*  raising concerns. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=84.44s)]
*  One 26-year veteran of the agency told the Times the question on his mind is, was this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=86.52s)]
*  just luck that you caught this guy, or did you have the appropriate mechanisms in place? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=92.08s)]
*  The Secret Service has been under intense scrutiny since it failed to prevent the assassination [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=97.84s)]
*  attempt on Trump in July. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=101.88s)]
*  After that attack, it did reassign some agents from President Biden's advance team to protect [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=104.22s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=109.44s)]
*  Rowe said yesterday that the agency's facing what he called a heightened threat environment [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=110.44s)]
*  and he needs Congress to approve more funding for personnel and overtime pay. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=115.48s)]
*  The agency's been understaffed for years. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=120.12s)]
*  Today on The Daily, details about the suspect from the golf course who's currently in custody [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=125.88s)]
*  in Florida and a look at how this year's presidential race is playing out in a new era of political [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=129.96s)]
*  violence. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=136.12s)]
*  The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, has deployed state troopers to the town of Springfield [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=141.44s)]
*  to try and reassure the community after dozens of bomb threats have come pouring in against [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=147.6s)]
*  schools, hospitals, and city offices. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=151.88s)]
*  Springfield has been at the center of a political firestorm since Donald Trump amplified a false [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=155.2s)]
*  rumor during the debate about Haitian immigrants in Springfield eating pets. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=159.52s)]
*  In the last week, daily life has been upended there, with schools evacuated, children sheltering [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=164.24s)]
*  at home, and Haitian residents worried about being targeted. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=169.58s)]
*  DeWine, a Republican, said that investigators have determined that many of the threats are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=173.3s)]
*  coming from overseas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  He said they're being made by, quote, those who want to fuel the current discord surrounding [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=180.3s)]
*  Springfield. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=184.66000000000003s)]
*  Times reporter Adam Raskan, who's been covering the war in Gaza, recently sat down in Qatar [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=194.5s)]
*  for an interview with a top leader of Hamas, Khaled Mashal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=199.58s)]
*  Mashal is someone who has rarely spoken to the Western media, and especially since the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=204.18s)]
*  start of the war. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=211.06s)]
*  And this was a rare opportunity to go in and ask questions of one of the most senior officials [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=212.66s)]
*  in the group. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  Adam met with Mashal at his home in the suburbs of Doha, where a flat-screen TV was playing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=220.02s)]
*  images of Gaza in the background as they spoke for more than two hours. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=224.78s)]
*  Despite all the devastation and destruction in Gaza coming out of this meeting, I was [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=229.02s)]
*  left with the impression that Hamas is quite confident with the position it's in. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  In the early days of the war, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel and President Biden spoke [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  of Hamas's elimination. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=247.10000000000002s)]
*  Today, President Biden and other American leaders are talking about the need for a ceasefire [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=249.22s)]
*  with Hamas. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=255.74s)]
*  And for Mashal, this is an implicit recognition of Hamas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=257.06s)]
*  It has made them feel confident about their future in Gaza. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=262.86s)]
*  It was also clear in sitting with Mashal that Hamas was not willing to rush into a ceasefire [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=267.86s)]
*  at any price and that they were going to hold out for their key demands, which are a complete [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=275.38s)]
*  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to the war. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=283.1s)]
*  At one point in the interview, I asked him about criticisms from Palestinians in Gaza [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=286.46s)]
*  who have accused Hamas of giving Israel an excuse to wage a massive bombing campaign [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  that has reduced cities to rubble. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=300.94s)]
*  And he dismissed those criticisms. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  But I still sort of pressed him, asking, the situation in Gaza has become much worse [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=306.66s)]
*  than before October 7th, and Palestinians have experienced immense suffering. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  But he said it was a price that Palestinians must pay for freedom. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=318.66s)]
*  The hip-hop mogul Sean Combs was arrested last night in New York City after months of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=328.82000000000005s)]
*  escalating investigations and lawsuits over alleged sexual assault and misconduct. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=333.38s)]
*  He was at the Manhattan hotel where he had been awaiting an expected indictment against [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=338.58s)]
*  him and we learned that a grand jury in New York had indeed indicted him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  Times reporter Julia Jacobs has been covering the investigations into Combs, also known [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=350.98s)]
*  as Diddy or Puff Daddy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=355.04s)]
*  We know through Mr. Combs' lawyers that he expects the charges to be racketeering and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=356.8s)]
*  sex trafficking. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=362.46s)]
*  We don't at this point have any more details on what's in the indictment. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=364.26s)]
*  The U.S. Attorney's Office expects it to be unsealed, so we should have plenty more information [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=368.94s)]
*  then. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=375.18s)]
*  Combs was held overnight and is expected to be arraigned today. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=376.62s)]
*  He spent the last year under increasing scrutiny since his former girlfriend, the singer Cassie, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=380.14s)]
*  filed a lawsuit accusing him of years of physical and sexual abuse. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=386.02s)]
*  He settled that suit but then faced eight more from other women. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=390.38s)]
*  Combs vehemently denied all the allegations, but his tone of defiance shifted after hotel [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=394.94s)]
*  surveillance footage emerged showing him dragging and kicking Cassie back in 2016. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=400.34s)]
*  This spring, federal agents raided his homes in L.A. and Miami Beach. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=406.54s)]
*  Prosecutors have also been quietly delivering subpoenas to witnesses for months, building [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=411.3s)]
*  their case. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=415.46s)]
*  Combs' legal team says he's a quote, innocent man with nothing to hide, and he looks forward [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=417.5s)]
*  to clearing his name in court. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=422.18s)]
*  And finally, an endless stream of weight loss products has been around for decades. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=429.78s)]
*  Tablets, powders, shakes, teas, etc. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=434.34s)]
*  But in the era of Ozempic, they've taken on a new life. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=437.7s)]
*  Companies and influencers are now pushing products they say can offer the same dramatic [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=441.62s)]
*  kind of results without a prescription, basically Ozempic dupes, as they're called online. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=445.5s)]
*  And notably, some of them are using the same language as the medication. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=451.42s)]
*  Their branding talks about GLP-1, a gut hormone that helps you feel full. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=455.42s)]
*  Drugs like Ozempic simulate that hormone to suppress appetite. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=461.26s)]
*  They're using a lot of the language that was once pretty obscure and turning it into marketing [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=464.7s)]
*  buzzwords. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=470.46s)]
*  Like, nobody knew what GLP-1 was a few years ago if you weren't a doctor or a drug maker. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=471.46s)]
*  Dani Blum covers health trends for the Times. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=477.06s)]
*  She says the latest product in the mix comes from the reality TV star, Kourtney Kardashian, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=479.58s)]
*  whose supplement company Lemmy is releasing a new supplement called GLP-1 Daily. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=485.02s)]
*  People might shell out and think that they are getting something that is maybe even close [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=491.02s)]
*  to an actual GLP-1 medication. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=495.76s)]
*  There just isn't evidence right now that this supplement or any other could even come close [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=499.18s)]
*  to the kinds of results that people see when they take actual name brand Ozempic. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=505.02000000000004s)]
*  And I think this just really speaks to where we are at this point in the Ozempic era, which [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  is that the language around these drugs, even really technical jargon, has seeped into our [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  daily conversation. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=521.64s)]
*  And these drugs are so top of mind for people. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=523.34s)]
*  There's so much demand for them that we're seeing entire cottage industries spring up [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=526.02s)]
*  trying to chase any possible spillover effect or profit from just how popular these drugs are. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=531.14s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=542.62s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=543.62s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRiDqiuUQkk&t=544.9399999999999s)]
