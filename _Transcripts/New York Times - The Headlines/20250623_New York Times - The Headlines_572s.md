# Inside US Strikes on Iran, Major Heat Wave Spreads, Tesla Begins Robotaxi Service | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson in for Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Monday, June 23rd. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=9.68s)]
*  The Middle East is on edge this morning with fears of a dangerously escalating conflict [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=15.48s)]
*  after the U.S. entered into war with Iran over the weekend. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=23.0s)]
*  key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=29.36s)]
*  In a speech on Saturday night, President Trump said the U.S. had joined Israel's attacks [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=34.28s)]
*  on the country and claimed that the U.S. military had, quote, totally obliterated multiple facilities [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=38.62s)]
*  that were part of Iran's nuclear program, though the full extent of any damage to the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=44.08s)]
*  facilities or any casualties is still unclear. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=48.16s)]
*  There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight, not even close. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Just two days earlier, the White House had said there was a substantial chance of negotiating [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=57.36s)]
*  with Iran over the future of its nuclear program. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=61.48s)]
*  But the Times has since learned that at that point, Trump had all but made up his mind [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=64.2s)]
*  to launch strikes and military preparations were already underway. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=68.48s)]
*  When President Trump delivered a statement through the White House press secretary last [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=72.8s)]
*  Thursday that he was going to decide what to do about Iran within the next two weeks, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=76.16s)]
*  mostly it was a misdirection to keep people's focus off the strike. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=81.84s)]
*  Maggie Haberman is a Times White House correspondent. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=86.2s)]
*  She says that the two-week statement was part of a broader effort to obscure the attack [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=89.04s)]
*  plan and make it seem less certain that it would happen at all. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  That effort also included using at least one decoy bomber that headed west across the Pacific [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=97.0s)]
*  as a distraction on Saturday, while a primary group of B-2 bombers headed east toward Iran. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=102.36s)]
*  After 17 hours of nonstop flying, that group, escorted by fighter jets, entered Iranian [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=108.36s)]
*  airspace. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  They then dropped more than a dozen 30,000-pound bombs on the site of an underground nuclear [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=115.4s)]
*  facility, while cruise missiles were launched from a nearby U.S. submarine at other sites. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=120.36s)]
*  Now administration officials have framed this as a one-off event and suggested that it [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  can remain that way if Iran comes to the table to discuss curtailing its nuclear program. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=130.44s)]
*  However, the president late Sunday in the afternoon suggested he was curious about how [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=136.0s)]
*  regime change, something his administration officials had strongly insisted this was not [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=141.52s)]
*  about, might play. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=146.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Tehran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=151.8s)]
*  Officials are publicly moving to project a sunster normalcy and try to downplay the damage [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=153.8s)]
*  on the nuclear sites. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=160.36s)]
*  But in my conversations with officials, the mood internally is pretty grim. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=162.12s)]
*  And there's a lot of divisions within the government about how to respond. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=167.4s)]
*  For Anas Faisi, he covers Iran for the Times. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=172.72s)]
*  She said that while Iran has responded forcefully to Israel's ongoing attacks, hitting back [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  at the U.S., including the 40,000 troops and civilians working for the Pentagon in the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=179.96s)]
*  Middle East, could be riskier. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=184.8s)]
*  You know, the U.S. has toppled governments in Iraq and Afghanistan right next door to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Iran's east and west. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=190.88s)]
*  So the stakes are much higher for Iran in deciding to escalate with the U.S. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=192.48s)]
*  So we're hearing a range of views, you know, hardliners in the parliament were calling [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=198.32s)]
*  for not just targeting and attacking American military bases in the region, but Iran disrupting [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=203.52s)]
*  the flow of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=210.44s)]
*  Then there were calls for restraint, saying this is a really critical moment and we need [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=213.72s)]
*  to act with wisdom and not have a knee-jerk reaction that could make things worse. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=217.92s)]
*  We won't really know what Iran is going to do until the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=223.16s)]
*  issues a statement. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=229.32s)]
*  But remarkably, Mr. Khamenei is nowhere to be seen or heard. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=230.56s)]
*  He is hiding in a bunker. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=234.48s)]
*  They've suspended all electronic communication to protect him against assassination. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, messages between Mr. Khamenei and his commanders is handwritten or carried by [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=241.6s)]
*  a human messenger. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=246.64s)]
*  So there is a sense of uncertainty hanging over Iranians right now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=248.27999999999997s)]
*  On today's episode of The Daily, my colleague David Sanger has more details about the American [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  strikes and what could come next in the war. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=260.2s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestine activist, has been released [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=270.0s)]
*  on bail after a federal judge had determined that his arrest was likely unconstitutional. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=275.2s)]
*  In his first interview since his release, Khalil told the Times that his arrest back [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=281.44s)]
*  in March by plainclothes immigration officers, quote, felt like a kidnapping. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=285.26s)]
*  Khalil, a Palestinian born in a Syrian refugee camp, is a permanent U.S. resident who became [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=290.36s)]
*  a leader in the protest movement on Columbia's campus last year. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  He was never accused of a crime, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that he was a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=299.96s)]
*  foreign policy threat because he had contributed to the spread of anti-Semitism through his [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=304.44s)]
*  role in the protests. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=308.92s)]
*  In his interview at the Times, Khalil rejected that claim, saying that he was simply advocating [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=310.98s)]
*  for his people. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=315.32s)]
*  I was not doing anything anti-Semitic, he said. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=316.4s)]
*  I was literally advocating for an end of a genocide. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=319.44s)]
*  His three-month stint at a Louisiana detention center meant that he missed the birth of his [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=323.62s)]
*  son, and he told the Times that there was, quote, nothing in this world that would compensate [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=327.48s)]
*  me for the time I lost with my family. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=331.94s)]
*  Still, Khalil says his commitment to the pro-Palestinian cause is unwavering, and that President Trump's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=334.54s)]
*  attempts to crack down on protesters had instead, quote, advanced the movement 20 years. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=340.3s)]
*  He said that while he was in prison, he'd received hundreds of letters from people saying [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=346.04s)]
*  that his arrest had inspired them to get involved in the movement. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=349.6s)]
*  Despite his release, Khalil's case is still making its way through immigration courts, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=353.54s)]
*  and the government is still seeking to deport him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=357.6s)]
*  Across the Central and Eastern United States right now, a major heat wave is expanding, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=361.94s)]
*  threatening millions of people with dangerously high temperatures. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=371.7s)]
*  That heat, which reached around 100 degrees in parts of the Midwest over the weekend, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=375.7s)]
*  is expected to shift eastward. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=379.9s)]
*  By midweek, major cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. will be baking, and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=381.96s)]
*  Humidity may well push heat indexes to upwards of 115 degrees in some areas. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=387.58s)]
*  Meteorologists say this is being caused by a heat dome, a high-pressure system that traps [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=393.58s)]
*  hot air like a lid on a pot. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=398.38s)]
*  Nighttime temperatures are also expected to remain high in cities, limiting the body's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=401.38s)]
*  ability to cool down and increasing health risks. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=405.5s)]
*  In New York City, emergency management officials are sounding the alarm, warning that heat [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=408.94s)]
*  deadliest weather threat we face, and noting that over 500 residents die from heat-related [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=414.38s)]
*  causes each year. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=419.22s)]
*  A cold front is expected to bring some relief to the Northeast later in the week, but the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=421.06s)]
*  Mid-Atlantic will likely face above-average temperatures into the weekend. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  And finally, here is our ride. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=435.0s)]
*  One of the first robotaxi rides here in Austin. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=439.06s)]
*  In Austin, Texas, Tesla has launched a test of a self-driving car service it's calling [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=443.1s)]
*  RoboTaxi. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=448.06s)]
*  It's the first step toward CEO Elon Musk's promise of widespread autonomous ride-hailing. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=449.06s)]
*  For now, the service is invite-only and operates within specific areas of Austin, with safety [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=455.82000000000005s)]
*  monitors, i.e. human beings, sitting in the front passenger seat. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=461.1s)]
*  So it's stopping right here at the front door, the chained-up door. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=465.54s)]
*  There we go. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=469.86s)]
*  It's giving us a notification. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=470.86s)]
*  Please exit safely. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=472.66s)]
*  You can open the trunk with this button. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=473.66s)]
*  Tesla isn't the first company to roll out autonomous taxis. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=475.66s)]
*  Customized Jaguars, owned by the company Waymo, have been cruising the streets of San Francisco [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=478.74s)]
*  and other cities for several years now. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=483.38s)]
*  But Musk's goal is to eventually turn regular Tesla owners into RoboTaxi operators, having [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=486.02000000000004s)]
*  their cars go out and drive people around on their own while their owners are at work [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=491.62s)]
*  or sleeping. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=495.62s)]
*  Tesla is launching its RoboTaxi service at a critical time for the company. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=496.62s)]
*  Jack Ewing covers Tesla for the Times. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=501.78000000000003s)]
*  He says that the company has been struggling to make up for sales that plummeted after [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  Musk became a controversial figure in President Trump's administration. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHpz5hB0ndk&t=508.02s)]
