# Blinken Renews Push for Middle East Truce, and U.S. Abortions Increase
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=5.0s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, October 23rd. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=8.0s)]
*  So I am on Secretary of State Blinken's plane right now, and we're taxiing to depart from [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=15.0s)]
*  Tel Aviv to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=19.84s)]
*  Earlier this morning, as we were getting ready to leave our hotel in Tel Aviv, air raid sirens [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=23.36s)]
*  sounded in the city and all the guests in the hotel, including Secretary Blinken, were [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=28.6s)]
*  rushed down to shelters. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=34.0s)]
*  As it happened, there were no explosions in the area, but it reflected the tension that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=36.52s)]
*  so much of Israel is feeling right now as its conflicts escalate throughout the region. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=42.6s)]
*  My colleague Michael Crowley is traveling with Blinken on his latest Middle East tour, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=48.88s)]
*  where Blinken is pushing Israel on a truce with Hezbollah in Lebanon and once again for [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=53.36s)]
*  a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  This is Secretary Blinken's 11th trip to the Middle East since October 7th. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=60.76s)]
*  And there's frustration among U.S. officials that these visits have not been as effective [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=65.44s)]
*  as they had hoped. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=69.4s)]
*  Among other things, the U.S. tried for many months to prevent the conflict in Lebanon [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=70.6s)]
*  from escalating into the wider war that it's now become. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=74.92s)]
*  And now, of course, we're just a couple of weeks away from the U.S. election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=78.28s)]
*  And I think there's a feeling that that limits America's leverage as Israel is able to wait [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=82.64s)]
*  out the election and see whether it might have another president to deal with, potentially [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, who could be more forgiving toward Israel's military activities in the region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  A new report shows that abortions in the United States have increased since Roe v. Wade was [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=98.36s)]
*  overturned, even in states with tight restrictions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=114.6s)]
*  The study is the most comprehensive look at abortions since the ruling. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=118.72s)]
*  The data runs to the end of last year, and it shows that in 10 of the 13 states with [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=123.24s)]
*  near total bans, the number of women getting abortions went up. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=128.28s)]
*  Some traveled to clinics where the procedure is legal. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=133.32s)]
*  Others ordered pills online from out-of-state doctors. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=136.32s)]
*  The bans have prevented some women who wanted abortions from getting them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=139.8s)]
*  Research suggests they're largely teenagers, Black and Native American, and low-income. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=144.32s)]
*  But overall, the upward trend has surprised experts, who thought the restrictions would [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=149.88s)]
*  at the very least keep the number steady. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=154.52s)]
*  One possible explanation? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=157.38s)]
*  Shield laws. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=158.84s)]
*  Some states where the procedure is legal enacted those laws to protect doctors who prescribe [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=160.44s)]
*  mail-order pills for patients out-of-state. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=165.44s)]
*  Other potential factors behind the increase? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=168.9s)]
*  A number of new abortion clinics have opened. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=171.1s)]
*  And with a lot more people talking publicly about the procedure, the stigma around it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=174.1s)]
*  may have decreased. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=178.18s)]
*  US intelligence officials are putting out new warnings that Russia and Iran may be planning [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=179.18s)]
*  to stoke post-election chaos. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=191.86s)]
*  The officials say they don't think foreign countries will be able to affect the election [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=195.06s)]
*  outcome, but that they could try to cause unrest as the votes are counted. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=198.66s)]
*  In a report issued yesterday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=204.22s)]
*  that Russia may try to spark protests and even violence after Election Day, especially [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=208.44s)]
*  if Donald Trump loses. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=214.1s)]
*  It's part of an effort to undermine democracy as a political system. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=216.2s)]
*  Iran is also considering stirring up and amplifying unrest, according to the report. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=220.52s)]
*  The intelligence officials say both countries are, quote, better prepared to exploit opportunities [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=225.6s)]
*  to exert influence this year, after having studied the chaos surrounding the 2020 election. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=230.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, the fallout from the 2020 election continues for Rudy Giuliani. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=238.44s)]
*  On Tuesday, a federal judge ordered Trump's former personal lawyer to turn over most of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=246.26s)]
*  his possessions and available cash to help pay off his penalty for defaming two Georgia [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=251.46s)]
*  election workers. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=257.02s)]
*  Giuliani falsely claimed that they cheated Trump out of votes and later admitted he was [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=258.74s)]
*  lying. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=263.86s)]
*  The two women sued after they faced a torrent of threats and racist abuse. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=265.14s)]
*  One of the workers told a jury last year, quote, Giuliani just messed me up, you know? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=270.12s)]
*  Giuliani was ordered to pay them $148 million, and they've been waiting nearly a year for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=275.84s)]
*  that payment. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=281.14s)]
*  Now he has one week to give up his vintage Mercedes Benz, his apartment, jewelry, and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=282.8s)]
*  26 watches, even his TV. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=288.28s)]
*  The cash from the sale will go to paying the damages. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=291.34s)]
*  His lawyers say they'll appeal the ruling. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=294.8s)]
*  The financial penalty is not the only consequence Giuliani is facing for his efforts to overturn [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=297.24s)]
*  the results of the election. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=302.0s)]
*  He's been stripped of his law licenses in New York and Washington, D.C., and he faces [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=303.88s)]
*  criminal trials in Arizona and Georgia related to his efforts to keep Trump in office. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=308.06s)]
*  At American colleges and universities, freshman enrollment appears to have dropped 5% from [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=324.4s)]
*  last year, the biggest drop since 2020, when the pandemic and remote learning upended higher [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=328.9s)]
*  education. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=334.32s)]
*  The drop comes after a year of problems, delays, and frustrations with the Free Application [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=336.0s)]
*  for Federal Student Aid form, FAFSA. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  The form was revamped under a mandate to make it simpler, but the very buggy rollout delayed [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=344.53999999999996s)]
*  schools from being able to send out financial aid offers until well into the summer, leaving [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=350.12s)]
*  many families struggling to determine how much college would cost. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=355.06s)]
*  On its own, the data doesn't establish a link between the dip in enrollment and the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=359.52s)]
*  FAFSA problems, but it does show there was a drop particularly at schools serving lower-income [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=363.58s)]
*  students. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=369.76s)]
*  The director of the research center that gathered the data said a lot of factors could be shaping [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=370.76s)]
*  students' decisions not to go to college, including the recent Supreme Court ruling [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=374.96s)]
*  ending affirmative action, anxiety over student debt, and a strong job market in addition [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=379.5s)]
*  to any FAFSA frustrations. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=384.94s)]
*  And he said there's little evidence to suggest high school students who put off college will [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=386.38s)]
*  ever enroll. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=391.22s)]
*  He said, quote, these students end up with jobs and sometimes families, and they find [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=392.82s)]
*  it harder and harder as time goes on to think about entering college again. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=397.14s)]
*  On a little piece of land curling out from the coast in southwestern England, there is [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=410.3s)]
*  essentially a giant science experiment happening. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=414.46000000000004s)]
*  The area used to be low-lying farmland, constantly battling back the water. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=418.14s)]
*  But over a decade ago, an environmental trust and the British government got together to [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=424.0s)]
*  try something. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  They wanted to let it flood. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  The idea was fairly controversial because rather than doing what Britain and countless [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=431.94s)]
*  countries around the world have done for decades, which was investing in traditional [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=436.5s)]
*  flood defenses like seawalls, the plan was essentially surrender. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=440.34s)]
*  That seemed to be the logic behind the project, that you would give over the land to the water [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=444.94s)]
*  rather than trying to protect it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=449.18s)]
*  Times reporter Rory Smith went out to the area where farmers were paid to give up their [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=451.66s)]
*  acreage so the trust could turn it back into marshland. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=455.98s)]
*  He says based on the results, the project could offer a blueprint for how other coastal [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=459.86s)]
*  areas can adapt as climate change brings more flooding. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=464.22s)]
*  I went out earlier this year to see what the project had become. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=468.54s)]
*  It feels wild and wind-swept. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=473.1s)]
*  There's lots of rivers and streams and rivulets. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=475.98s)]
*  There's a lot of mud. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=479.02000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of grass. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=480.02000000000004s)]
*  But what's most impressive is not how it looks, it's what it does. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=481.02000000000004s)]
*  It provides a sanctuary and a haven for all sorts of wildlife, species of birds that hadn't [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=485.42s)]
*  been seen frequently in that part of Britain for years and years because they hadn't had [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=491.46000000000004s)]
*  the appropriate environment in which to thrive. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=495.86s)]
*  It provides a natural flood defense. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=499.22s)]
*  Last winter was a particularly rough one for everyone in Britain, but the village of Steer [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=502.3s)]
*  right at the tip of the peninsula didn't flood. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=506.22s)]
*  That's because the water was absorbed by the marshland as it was designed to do. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=509.82s)]
*  But the real success is the fact that there is more marsh than there used to be. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=514.3s)]
*  The land has grown vertically by several feet over the last 10 years, which is testament [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=519.0999999999999s)]
*  to the amount of carbon captured by the marsh. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=525.3s)]
*  That's the lesson that the people who designed and managed the scheme take from the last [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=529.06s)]
*  10 years. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7vQ333TVyg&t=533.26s)]
