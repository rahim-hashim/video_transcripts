# Millions of Federal Workers Offered Payouts, and Kennedy’s Senate Test
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=4.74s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, January 29th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=5.74s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Employees of the United States government got an unexpected email yesterday from the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  Office of Personnel Management. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=18.88s)]
*  The subject line, fork in the road. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=20.96s)]
*  Inside was an offer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=25.2s)]
*  Stay at your job as part of a, quote, reformed federal workforce or take a buyout and leave. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=26.72s)]
*  The offer covers roughly two million federal workers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=33.98s)]
*  It's part of the Trump administration's effort to drastically reduce the size of the government [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=37.6s)]
*  and to push out people who don't support the president's agenda. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=42.16s)]
*  The email warned that people who do choose to stay will face what it called enhanced [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=45.92s)]
*  standards of conduct to ensure that workers are, quote, reliable, loyal, trustworthy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=50.96s)]
*  For people who want the buyout, they were asked to simply write back the word resign [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=57.26s)]
*  and hit send. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=62.14s)]
*  Not all federal employees are eligible for the deal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=64.22s)]
*  The Office of Personnel Management said members of the military, postal service workers, immigration [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  officials and others would be exempt, but the move could gut the staff responsible for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=72.36s)]
*  a lot of services Americans rely on. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=76.94s)]
*  And things like filing a tax return, renewing a passport, going to a national park or accessing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=79.7s)]
*  food stamps could all be disrupted. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=85.06s)]
*  The drastic buyout offer, which the Trump administration may not have the authority [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  to follow through on, is just one of dozens of policy changes and executive orders that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=92.36s)]
*  have been rolled out over the last 10 days. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=97.3s)]
*  The onslaught is intentional. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=99.94s)]
*  During Trump's first term, his team boasted about the flood the zone tactic. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=102.94s)]
*  This time around, Trump's policy adviser Stephen Miller has been pushing it aggressively. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=108.25999999999999s)]
*  The theory goes that rolling out multiple changes almost simultaneously overwhelms any [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=113.78s)]
*  opposition and makes it harder to push back. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=118.7s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=122.58s)]
*  The American people voted for dramatic change implemented by Donald Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=125.02s)]
*  So it is essential for him to get control of government. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=130.18s)]
*  On Tuesday, Miller went on CNN to defend one of the president's most dramatic directives [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  so far, his attempt to freeze trillions of dollars of federal funding. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=137.78s)]
*  Either Donald Trump gets political control over this government and ends the waste, abuse [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=142.38s)]
*  and fraud on the American people or we let bureaucrats autopilot federal spending. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=150.38s)]
*  The freeze created a surge of confusion and panic across the country before a federal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=156.0s)]
*  judge temporarily blocked it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=160.56s)]
*  Schools, hospitals, nonprofits, research companies and many other organizations scrambled to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=162.68s)]
*  figure out if they'd have to shut down their services. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=167.92s)]
*  Some did. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=170.88s)]
*  A health agency in Arizona stopped distributing Narcan and a head start program for 600 kids [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=171.88s)]
*  in Michigan canceled preschool for today after it couldn't access funds online. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=177.44s)]
*  For now, the pause is on hold after an activist group sued the Trump administration over it, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=182.66s)]
*  calling it unconstitutional. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=187.74s)]
*  The judge in the case said she would issue a more permanent decision next week. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=189.82s)]
*  For more about the freeze and whether it's likely to survive in court, listen to today's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=194.46s)]
*  episode of The Daily. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  This morning on Capitol Hill, one of President Trump's most polarizing cabinet picks, Robert [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=203.9s)]
*  F. Kennedy Jr. will face his first confirmation hearing, where senators will consider whether [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=209.02s)]
*  he should lead the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=214.46s)]
*  The philosophy that he brings to this position could have far reaching ramifications for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=217.78s)]
*  the kinds of drugs that Americans have access to, the kinds of vaccines that we give our [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  children, the ingredients that we put in foods, not to mention people's health insurance [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=230.86s)]
*  and overall medical well-being. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=239.3s)]
*  My colleague Cheryl Gay Stolberg covers health policy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=243.62s)]
*  She says Kennedy rose to prominence pushing unorthodox views that medical experts say [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=246.74s)]
*  are dangerous. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  He's railed against vaccines, promised to take fluoride out of drinking water, and encouraged [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=252.82000000000002s)]
*  people to drink raw milk. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=257.74s)]
*  She says while he's recently shifted his emphasis to less controversial issues, like cutting [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=259.94s)]
*  back on how much ultra-processed foods Americans eat or fighting chronic disease, it's those [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=264.7s)]
*  earlier views that will likely be at the center of this week's hearings. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=270.56s)]
*  Kennedy is going to face a lot of tough questions, especially about his views on vaccination, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=274.94s)]
*  which really alarm public health experts. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=280.78s)]
*  He spent years sowing doubts about vaccines. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  He's participated in lawsuits against vaccine makers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=288.94s)]
*  And public health people regard vaccination as truly one of the great triumphs of their [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  field. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=299.82s)]
*  The fact that we have eradicated smallpox and nearly eliminated polio and greatly reduced [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=300.82s)]
*  other childhood diseases that can be prevented with vaccines. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=308.82s)]
*  We're worried that this progress will be endangered if Kennedy becomes health secretary. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=313.86s)]
*  It's not clear yet whether Kennedy will get the votes he needs to be confirmed. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=320.5s)]
*  He can only afford to lose the support of three Republicans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=323.74s)]
*  And so far, several GOP senators have not said if they'll back him. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=327.68s)]
*  That includes Mitch McConnell, who survived polio as a child. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=332.06s)]
*  New data released today shows that American students' reading scores have reached a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=336.42s)]
*  record low. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=343.66s)]
*  One-third of eighth graders have below-basic reading skills, according to the National [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=345.58000000000004s)]
*  Assessment of Educational Progress. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  That means when they read a passage, they can't identify what the main idea is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  For fourth graders, the results are even worse. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=357.1s)]
*  Forty percent have below-basic reading skills. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=359.98s)]
*  The poor results cut across demographics like race and class and are a disappointment for [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=363.22s)]
*  educators who had been hoping for a rebound from widespread pandemic learning loss. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=368.42s)]
*  Experts have no clear explanation for why the scores are dropping. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=374.22s)]
*  Some point to a rise in screen time. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  Kids are watching videos more and reading less, which means they're getting less practice. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  More screen time could also be affecting their attention spans and their ability to focus. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=385.66s)]
*  Other experts point to how much school kids are missing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=390.34s)]
*  The percentage of American students who are chronically absent is still far higher than [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=393.9s)]
*  it was before the pandemic. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=397.82s)]
*  And finally, after 500 years, Mona Lisa is getting her own room. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=406.94s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron announced that the Louvre Museum in Paris, which houses [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=412.53999999999996s)]
*  Da Vinci's masterpiece, is expanding, and the plans include a special exhibition space [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=417.06s)]
*  just for the painting. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=422.46s)]
*  The goal is to try and make room for more visitors. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=424.3s)]
*  Nine million people a year come through the museum. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=426.9s)]
*  An estimated 80 percent of them are there to see Mona Lisa. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=430.3s)]
*  Because of the crowds, that means some people who go to see her famous smile just see like [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=434.04s)]
*  the top of her head or a little slice of her cheek in between other tourists' phones. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=438.46s)]
*  After the announcement, one French art expert pointed out that the museum could also do [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=444.5s)]
*  more to showcase its other masterpieces. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=448.82s)]
*  Beyond Mona Lisa, the Louvre has half a million pieces in its collection and 30,000 on display. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=452.18s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=462.34s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=463.86s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyDwyX6aCL8&t=464.86s)]
