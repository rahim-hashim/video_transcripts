# The Campaign for the Midwest, and Antiracism Demonstrations in the U.K.
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=4.84s)]
*  Today's Thursday, August 8th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=5.84s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=8.08s)]
*  First I want to say how great it is to be here in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=15.8s)]
*  Oh, it really is good to be back in Wisconsin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=19.0s)]
*  I'd like to start with Michigan reporters. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=22.76s)]
*  Holy hell, can you throw a party here in Michigan? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=25.44s)]
*  The battle to win over the Midwest is on. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=29.2s)]
*  Both the Harris and Trump campaigns made dueling appearances in the same cities yesterday. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=32.16s)]
*  Harris and her running mate Tim Walz held a packed rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, then [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=37.44s)]
*  another in Detroit. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=42.36s)]
*  While Donald Trump's running mate J.D. Vance made stops in Eau Claire and the Detroit suburbs. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=44.44s)]
*  We actually just saw the vice president's plane on the tarmac. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=49.28s)]
*  We landed about the same time that she did. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=53.44s)]
*  Wisconsin and Michigan are prime targets for both sides. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  The two swing states narrowly went for Joe Biden in 2020. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=58.88s)]
*  And at the events yesterday, Harris brought in some of the biggest crowds of her campaign [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  to date. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=66.68s)]
*  But in Detroit, she also faced pushback. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=67.68s)]
*  And look, as we move our nation forward, Donald Trump... [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=70.92s)]
*  Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted her speech, chanting, Kamala, Kamala, you can't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=75.88s)]
*  hide. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=81.12s)]
*  We won't vote for genocide. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=82.12s)]
*  Harris moved to shut them down. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=84.4s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=86.72s)]
*  If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=87.72s)]
*  Otherwise, I'm speaking. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=91.2s)]
*  Opposition to the war in Gaza has been a fault line in the Democratic Party and will continue [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=93.76s)]
*  to be an issue heading into November. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=98.48s)]
*  As vice president, Harris has been more outspoken than Biden about the suffering of Palestinians, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=101.2s)]
*  but has not strayed far from Biden's support of Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  Harris and Walz will hold their next rally in Arizona tomorrow. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=110.28s)]
*  Trump, meanwhile, will be back on the campaign trail talking to voters in Montana. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=114.28s)]
*  Across the UK last night, thousands of people took to the streets to denounce the violent [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  right-wing riots that have swept the country in recent days. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=137.0s)]
*  They chanted anti-racism slogans and held signs saying, refugees welcome and fascists [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=143.0s)]
*  out. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=148.64s)]
*  Britain's been in turmoil for the last week after misinformation spread online about the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=149.64s)]
*  background of a teenager accused of a deadly attack on a children's dance class. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=154.96s)]
*  Authorities have said the suspect was born and raised in Britain, but rumors that he [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=160.04s)]
*  was an undocumented immigrant circulated on social media. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=164.56s)]
*  Violating extremist groups amplified the claims, and rioters in more than a dozen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=168.7s)]
*  cities have attacked mosques, looted businesses, and targeted hotels that house immigrants [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  seeking asylum. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=178.66s)]
*  The rate of immigration into the UK has spiked in recent years, turning the issue into a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=180.54s)]
*  flashpoint, particularly on the right, and the rioters have included neo-Nazis and anti-Muslim [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=185.54s)]
*  campaigners. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=191.89999999999998s)]
*  More than 400 people have been arrested so far, including some accused of using the internet [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=193.14s)]
*  to incite the violence. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=198.26s)]
*  The country's Prime Minister Keir Starmer has criticized social media companies for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=200.26s)]
*  allowing the misinformation and calls for violence to spread on their platforms, and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=205.06s)]
*  he said, quote, the far right are showing who they are. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  We have to show who we are in response to that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=213.89999999999998s)]
*  The Vienna dates for Taylor Swift's Blockbuster Eras Tour have been canceled after Austrian [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  authorities said they arrested two men who were plotting a terrorist attack. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=227.3s)]
*  Swift had been scheduled to play three shows in Vienna starting today, with 200,000 fans [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=231.72s)]
*  expected to attend. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=237.32s)]
*  Authorities say one of the men arrested, a 19-year-old Austrian citizen, recently pledged [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=239.2s)]
*  allegiance to the Islamic State after becoming radicalized online. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=244.58s)]
*  He was considering the Eras Tour as a target. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=249.04s)]
*  Officials raided his home and sent a bomb squad there after finding chemical substances. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=251.86s)]
*  The Islamic State has carried out three high-profile attacks on concert venues in the past decade. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=257.16s)]
*  One counterterrorism expert said several plots have been foiled across Europe this year [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=263.04s)]
*  and that many of those plots have featured young ISIS supporters, some of whom are radicalized [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=268.4s)]
*  via TikTok. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=273.84s)]
*  Today marks one year since a wildfire swept through Lahaina on the island of Maui. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=274.8s)]
*  It reduced the town to ashes and killed at least 102 people. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  In the last year, officials have put new funding into firefighting equipment. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=294.44s)]
*  They've revamped evacuation procedures and cut back the grasslands that fueled the flames. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=298.92s)]
*  But Times reporter Mike Baker, who was there in the days after the fire, says the town is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  just at the beginning of what will be a years-long rebuilding effort. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=310.16s)]
*  A lot of it right now feels quite disorienting. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=314.12s)]
*  You know, the old foundations that survived the fire, many of them have been wiped away. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=316.72s)]
*  A lot of the lots now are just layers of fresh gravel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  So you drive down the streets and sometimes it's difficult to tell what street you were on. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=325.44s)]
*  What was the landmark that used to be here? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=330.32s)]
*  What building was this that was on this corner? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=332.0s)]
*  What street am I at? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=335.04s)]
*  Mike says one of the biggest questions facing residents is what to rebuild. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=336.76s)]
*  Some want to resurface layers of Hawaiian history that were buried by time and development. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=341.56s)]
*  Lahaina was once home to palaces for the Royal Hawaiian family, while others want to bring [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=346.96s)]
*  back a bustling commercial waterfront. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=352.32s)]
*  In the rebuilding process, there's a lot of questions about whether Lahaina had become [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=354.72s)]
*  too focused on catering to tourism and had maybe lost sight of that deeper Native Hawaiian history. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=360.32s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of a push to restore more of that heritage, maybe renaming the street names, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=368.08s)]
*  maybe bringing back some of these old grounds that were central to the Hawaiian kingdom. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=374.92s)]
*  But there are others who also have deep ties to the area who are Native Hawaiian, who want to see [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=381.92s)]
*  that waterfront rebuilt as it was, to see the waterfront restaurants and nice boutiques and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=388.6s)]
*  fancy art galleries come back and restored just as it used to be. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=394.76000000000005s)]
*  The county has said it will release a long term rebuilding plan for Lahaina by the end of this year. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=402.0s)]
*  And finally. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=414.0s)]
*  We know that at some point we need to bring Butch and Sonny home. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  In a press conference on Wednesday, NASA acknowledged what it had been downplaying for weeks. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=421.44s)]
*  Two of its astronauts on the International Space Station don't really have a ride home yet. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=426.68s)]
*  Butch Wilmore and Sonny Williams traveled to the station on the Boeing Starliner in June, the first time [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=432.84s)]
*  the craft had ever carried astronauts. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=438.64s)]
*  It was supposed to be an eight day trip, but there were problems with the ship that have kept them up there [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=441.36s)]
*  now for more than two months. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=445.88s)]
*  And NASA says it's got a plan B. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=447.96s)]
*  It's going to keep trying to fix the Starliner. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=450.88s)]
*  But if it can't, the astronauts will just become a regular part of the space station crew for now and come [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=453.32s)]
*  back on a capsule built by SpaceX in February. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=459.32s)]
*  The whole thing adds more headaches and embarrassment for Boeing, which has been trying to prove it can be a [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=463.28s)]
*  player in space and compete with SpaceX. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=468.8s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily, a look inside the Harris Campaign's Wisconsin Field Office and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=474.8s)]
*  how they're trying to win over voters. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=484.6s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPImV58IN9I&t=488.56s)]
