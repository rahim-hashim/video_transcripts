# Harris Makes Her Case, and the New Covid Vaccine
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=4.92s)]
*  Today is Friday, August 23rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=8.36s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=11.36s)]
*  Okay, we've got to get to some business. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=14.36s)]
*  We've got to get to some business. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=21.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic nomination for president last night in front [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=22.96s)]
*  of a packed house at the United Center in Chicago. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=27.44s)]
*  Just a month ago, she was best known as Joe Biden's vice president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=30.96s)]
*  Now she's the candidate herself. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=34.88s)]
*  And her acceptance speech gave her the widest audience she's had yet to introduce herself [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  to the country. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=41.88s)]
*  So America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was no doubt unexpected. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=43.28s)]
*  But I'm no stranger to unlikely journeys. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  A lot of voters still don't know very much about her personal story, her personal journey, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=56.04s)]
*  what she's overcome. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=61.52s)]
*  And that made up a big chunk of her speech. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=62.52s)]
*  Times reporter Nicholas Nehemos was in Chicago covering the convention. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=66.16s)]
*  He says Harris walked through her biography, being raised by a single mother, growing up [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=70.14s)]
*  in a working class neighborhood in California, and feeling called to become a prosecutor. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  It was also clear that she was trying to hit back against some of the attacks that Donald [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=80.6s)]
*  Trump and Republicans have made against her, namely that she's weak on the border, that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=85.92s)]
*  she's weak on crime. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=91.4s)]
*  And she talked about her experience when she was the attorney general of California. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=93.44s)]
*  I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings, who threaten [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  the security of our border and the safety of our communities. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=106.8s)]
*  So there was definitely a law and order theme to her remarks. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=111.58s)]
*  And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=116.62s)]
*  And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=122.06s)]
*  She made a lot of points about taking care of our fellow citizens, being a good neighbor, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=129.38s)]
*  being a president for all Americans, which is not something we often hear from Trump, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=135.1s)]
*  who tends to demonize groups of people he perceives as others, whether that's certain [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=141.42s)]
*  kinds of immigrants or Democrats. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  So a very different message. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump is an unserious man. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=151.85999999999999s)]
*  But the consequences, but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=156.94s)]
*  House are extremely serious. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=164.66s)]
*  I think that the other contrast she's really trying to draw with Trump is that her campaign [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=167.62s)]
*  represents the future, her campaign represents progress, and Trump represents going back [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=174.54s)]
*  to, I think one of the phrases she used was chaos and calamity. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  But America, we are not going back. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=186.3s)]
*  We are not going back. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=190.62s)]
*  The vice president gave this speech in the absolutely most friendly environment a Democrat [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=193.3s)]
*  could ever imagine, the national convention full of rank-and-file party members. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  How the people in the room reacted matters a lot less than how the viewers on TV watching [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=204.56s)]
*  will react, especially those viewers who are undecided and live in the handful of battleground [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=211.22000000000003s)]
*  states that will really decide this election. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=217.52s)]
*  That's not something we can know tonight, but I think over the next few weeks we'll [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=220.62s)]
*  see if there's a polling bump, we'll see if there's a lot of grassroots fundraising, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=225.5s)]
*  and we'll start to see how successful a speech this was. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=230.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, hundreds of demonstrators were outside the convention hall last night while [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=235.5s)]
*  Harris was speaking to protest the war in Gaza. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=244.62s)]
*  U.S. support for Israel's military campaign is the most divisive issue within the party [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=248.54s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=253.54s)]
*  Some had expected protests to disrupt the convention, but the week passed without major [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=254.54s)]
*  clashes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=259.5s)]
*  Family members of hostages held in Gaza made brief remarks. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=260.5s)]
*  Organizers denied pro-Palestinian groups requests to speak on stage. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=265.34s)]
*  In her speech closing out the week, Harris did address the war, and her messaging signaled [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=269.74s)]
*  that she would pick up almost exactly where Biden left off. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  A balancing act of supporting Israel while calling out the toll the war has taken on [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=278.82s)]
*  civilians in Gaza. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  In Venezuela, the country's authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, has strengthened his [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=292.06s)]
*  grip on power after the country's Supreme Court, which is stacked with his allies, ruled [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=296.56s)]
*  that he officially won last month's presidential election. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  The ruling came despite overwhelming evidence that the opposition candidate won the most [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=306.53999999999996s)]
*  votes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  The court said its decision was supported by a tally from voting machines, but the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=312.14s)]
*  government has not released detailed results. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  The election had widespread irregularities and was condemned internationally. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=319.29999999999995s)]
*  Many Venezuelans took to the streets in protest after Maduro claimed he won. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=324.34s)]
*  In response, the government unleashed an intense crackdown, launching what it called [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=329.16s)]
*  Operation Knock Knock to round up people who questioned the results. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=333.68s)]
*  More than 2,000 people have been arrested in what human rights groups say is a wave [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  of repression the country hasn't seen in decades. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  Maduro's victory in court means he's now set to be in office until 2031. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=346.0s)]
*  The Food and Drug Administration has approved new COVID vaccines that are expected to ship [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=351.16s)]
*  to pharmacies and doctor's offices in the next few days. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=362.32000000000005s)]
*  The updated vaccines are expected to be effective against several strains of the virus that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=366.20000000000005s)]
*  have been causing a recent surge in infections. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=370.76000000000005s)]
*  In the past few weeks, Americans have been hospitalized for COVID at almost twice the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  rate as the same time last year. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=379.04s)]
*  While most people have acquired immunity against the virus from earlier infections or vaccinations, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=381.24s)]
*  older people and those who are immunocompromised are particularly at risk, and experts say [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  they should get the new vaccine as soon as possible. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  Most Americans haven't been getting COVID boosters. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=394.82000000000005s)]
*  As of earlier this year, just one in five adults had gotten the latest vaccine. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=398.12s)]
*  Canadians must be assured that their government will not allow them to suffer when parties [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  do not fill their responsibility to them at the bargaining table. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=413.88s)]
*  In Canada yesterday, just over 16 hours after a labour dispute brought the country's freight [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=417.88s)]
*  trains to a near total standstill, the government stepped in. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  The Labour Minister said rail companies must end their lockout of workers, and that their [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=427.44s)]
*  dispute with the union representing their employees has to be resolved in arbitration. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  Canadians are expected to start rolling again within days, preventing a longer shutdown [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=437.96s)]
*  that had threatened to disrupt billions of dollars in trade. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=442.32s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=455.56s)]
*  It was the love story that captured the world. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=456.56s)]
*  Sven and Magic, the two male gen 2 penguins whose family made global headlines. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=459.32s)]
*  An aquarium in Sydney, Australia announced that Sven, a penguin famous for hatching eggs [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=464.84s)]
*  with his same-sex partner Magic, has died. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=469.96s)]
*  Sven and Magic's love story began in 2018, and the timing felt symbolic for some people. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=473.88s)]
*  They got together not long after Australia legalized gay marriage, and debates over the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=480.23999999999995s)]
*  law had stirred up religious and political tensions across the country. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=484.84s)]
*  The queer community embraced Sven and Magic's story, and images of the penguins appeared [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=489.12s)]
*  in gay pride parades. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=494.32s)]
*  Over the course of the penguins' relationship, zookeepers gave Sven and Magic two eggs that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=496.52s)]
*  heterosexual penguin couples seemed to be neglecting. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=501.64s)]
*  They took turns incubating them and keeping them warm, successfully hatching chicks in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=505.16s)]
*  2018 and 2020. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=509.48s)]
*  Their story echoes that of another male penguin couple that became a symbol of equality, Roy [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  and Silo, who lived at the Central Park Zoo in Manhattan and hatched a chick named Tango, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=516.92s)]
*  aspiring the best-selling children's book, and Tango Makes Three. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=522.24s)]
*  The Sea Life Sydney Aquarium said the loss of Sven is heartbreaking for the staff, the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=526.48s)]
*  penguin colony, and for Magic. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=530.96s)]
*  To help him mourn the loss, they took Magic to see Sven after he died. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=533.24s)]
*  He started singing, and the zoo says the rest of the colony joined in. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=538.08s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YyW2hVBFhI&t=547.4000000000001s)]
