# Deportations Threaten Constitutional Showdown, and DOGE Cuts Hit Nuclear Agency
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=5.0s)]
*  Today is Monday, March 17. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=7.76s)]
*  The Trump administration has set up a legal showdown and a possible constitutional crisis [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=13.8s)]
*  with its latest deportations. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Over the weekend, it flew hundreds of Venezuelan migrants out of the country and turned them [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=22.16s)]
*  over to a prison in El Salvador, which is being paid by the U.S. to hold them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=26.92s)]
*  The administration said it had the authority to deport them because it claimed they were [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=31.76s)]
*  members of a violent criminal gang that was invading the country. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  A judge in D.C. rejected that rationale, saying he did not believe the deportations were legal [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=39.92s)]
*  under federal law, and he said that the detainees should be brought back, quote, however that's [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=44.88s)]
*  accomplished, whether turning around the plane or not. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=50.24s)]
*  But El Salvador's president mocked the judge's order, writing on social media, oopsie, too [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=54.0s)]
*  late. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=59.56s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio reshared that post, and the White House press secretary [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=61.22s)]
*  went further, claiming federal courts, quote, have no jurisdiction over how the president [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=65.6s)]
*  conducts foreign affairs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=71.2s)]
*  It was not the only deportation to spark concerns this weekend. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=73.36s)]
*  A woman from Lebanon who works as a kidney transplant specialist in the U.S. was also [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Even though she had a valid visa and a court order blocking her expulsion, according to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=82.6s)]
*  her lawyer. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=87.16s)]
*  The judge in her case said there was reason to believe immigration authorities had willfully [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=88.36s)]
*  disobeyed his order. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=93.0s)]
*  One could argue that we've slowly been heading towards a constitutional crisis for a few [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=94.72s)]
*  weeks now. In several cases, we've had plaintiffs come in and say, hey, judge, the administration [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=99.16s)]
*  is not following the court order that you issued. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=106.44s)]
*  Mattathias Schwartz covers federal courts for the Times. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=110.16s)]
*  He says the big question now is if and how the courts might try to reassert their power. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=113.2s)]
*  If the court were to find the administration in contempt, they would have the power to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=118.92s)]
*  impose financial penalties, fines on government agencies. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=123.08s)]
*  They would theoretically have the power to put government officials in prison if they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=126.8s)]
*  thought that was warranted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=131.4s)]
*  But then there's also the question of who exactly is going to enforce these orders. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=132.96s)]
*  In the final analysis, courts don't have the power to enforce their own orders. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=136.44s)]
*  And this is what people really are talking about when they talk about a constitutional [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=141.44s)]
*  crisis, that if the executive decides that it's just not going to listen to the courts, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=145.16s)]
*  there's sort of a very limited set of things that the courts can do in response. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=149.16s)]
*  Because the courts rely on the executive branch to enforce their orders. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=153.6s)]
*  So what do they do if the executive branch says we're just going to do what we want, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  we don't care? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=159.68s)]
*  No one really knows what happens then. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=160.68s)]
*  Also on the immigration front, President Trump has brought back family detention, the practice [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=167.4s)]
*  of locking up parents and children together while they await deportation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=173.44s)]
*  The contentious tactic was used under Presidents Bush and Obama and during Trump's first term. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=177.8s)]
*  But human rights organizations have called it inhumane, especially for young children, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=183.68s)]
*  and it fell out of use under the Biden administration. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  Now families are being held again at a facility in South Texas, and a second facility in the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=191.6s)]
*  area is being prepared to hold more. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=196.6s)]
*  The number of federal employees who've been fired or taken buyout offers under the Trump [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=206.32s)]
*  administration has now climbed past 100,000. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=210.64s)]
*  The Times has been tracking how that downsizing effort has been rippling through the government, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=214.92s)]
*  and my colleagues have found that the cuts have hit the agency responsible for nuclear [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=219.2s)]
*  security. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=223.11999999999998s)]
*  The National Nuclear Security Administration, which is part of the Department of Energy, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=224.56s)]
*  develops and maintains the country's nuclear arsenal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=228.88s)]
*  In the past five years, it's been busier than at any point since the Cold War. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=231.92s)]
*  It's in the middle of upgrading and modernizing thousands of nuclear bombs and warheads. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  It had been working to hire new employees to complete the work. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=241.64s)]
*  Then Doge arrived. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration fired about two dozen staffers. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=247.0s)]
*  Another 130-plus took buyouts. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=250.56s)]
*  A Times review of internal documents, along with interviews with agency officials, shows [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=253.48s)]
*  that included nuclear scientists, bomb engineers, and safety experts who were in critical roles, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=258.32s)]
*  and that many of them had held top-secret security clearance. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=264.8s)]
*  Without their oversight, the agency's effort to upgrade the nuclear stockpile could be [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=268.56s)]
*  compromised. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=273.4s)]
*  And critics say the situation shows the broader consequences of Doge's drastic cutbacks, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=274.64s)]
*  that people with specialized skills and decades of experience are leaving crucial government [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  positions. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=284.84s)]
*  In Gaza, it's now been more than two weeks since Israel cut off all aid shipments to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  the territory. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=300.28s)]
*  It's trying to pressure Hamas in negotiations over extending the ceasefire. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  Israel's cut off food shipments and severed electricity to a water plant. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  The United Nations says that's deprived around 600,000 Palestinians of clean drinking water. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=310.4s)]
*  The fact that no aid is coming in now means that Gaza could be headed back toward the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  dark days of the war when people were facing extreme hunger, a lack of water, very low [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  hospital supplies, and basically anything you can think of was running low. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=328.32s)]
*  Vivian Yee is part of the team covering Gaza for the Times. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=333.08s)]
*  My colleague Bilal Shabair has been doing some reporting inside of Gaza, and desperation [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=336.36s)]
*  is growing again as aid groups have been forced to cut back on food packages that they give [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=342.6s)]
*  out to families. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=348.32s)]
*  Community kitchens have had to give out smaller rations. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=349.36s)]
*  He's seeing people wait in these long, desperate lines for bread and people kind of crowding [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=352.64s)]
*  the bakery door desperate for a couple of loaves for their families. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=357.84s)]
*  And there are people in Gaza who say that traders and businessmen are basically taking [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=362.2s)]
*  advantage of the situation and hoarding goods in order to drive up the price and maximize [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  their profits. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=371.4s)]
*  From what we're seeing on the ground, in the beginning of the ceasefire, people were very [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=374.32s)]
*  cautiously optimistic that they would be able to recover and rebuild from the war. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=379.32s)]
*  The fighting would end and this nightmare of searching for food every day, searching [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=384.28s)]
*  for fuel, searching for water would be over. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  And instead, it seems like they might be regressing towards what they had suffered before. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=392.76s)]
*  Obviously, we're excited to get Crew 9 back and I know Butch and Sonny are excited to [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=403.2s)]
*  come back. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=408.08s)]
*  And it'll take a little time to get them back reconditioned and then we'll do the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=409.55999999999995s)]
*  proper celebration. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=413.48s)]
*  NASA says that the two astronauts who've been on an unexpectedly long mission to space could [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  be back on Earth as soon as tomorrow night. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=419.8s)]
*  Sonny Williams and Butch Wilmores' return from the International Space Station has been [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=422.92s)]
*  delayed for more than eight months due to technical issues. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=426.72s)]
*  But yesterday, the SpaceX capsule that will take them home successfully docked at the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=430.48s)]
*  station and the new crew of astronauts who will take their spots floated on. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=434.72s)]
*  Usually, crews overlap by a week, but NASA's bumping up the return window to try and take [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=439.72s)]
*  advantage of clear weather. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=444.36s)]
*  The journey back to Earth will be a 17-hour affair, ending off the Gulf Coast of Florida, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  where the astronauts are expected to splash down. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=451.44000000000005s)]
*  And finally, the New England Aquarium in Boston has opened a retirement home, or retirement [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=463.8s)]
*  island, for penguins. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=469.36s)]
*  It's because the aquarium's fleet of African penguins has been outliving expectations. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  In the wild, they live to be about 10 or 15, but the aquariums now got a bunch of birds [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  in their mid-30s. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=482.0s)]
*  And, like all of us in our mid-30s, they need someplace a little quieter, a little chiller, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=483.0s)]
*  without all of those young birds being loud and getting all the fish first. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=489.32s)]
*  The aquarium's penguin curator described it as a country club for older animals. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=493.16s)]
*  Basically, it's a meshed-off area where they can still see the other birds, but they [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=498.2s)]
*  don't have to get jostled or pecked by them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=502.12s)]
*  Part of the reason the penguins at the aquarium have been outliving expectations is because [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=504.96s)]
*  they don't have to deal with the threats that wild birds do, but also because they're [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=509.2s)]
*  receiving specialized care, including acupuncture for their arthritis. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=513.52s)]
*  Yes, the penguins are getting acupuncture. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=525.52s)]
*  Stay on the daily, how the fight over government funding has sparked a war within the Democratic [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lT7J3vRrEs&t=526.96s)]
