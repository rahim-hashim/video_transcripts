# Trump’s Latest Demands on Ukraine, and a White House Crypto Contest
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=4.72s)]
*  Today's Thursday, April 24th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=5.72s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  I think we have a deal with Russia. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=13.92s)]
*  We have to get a deal with Zelensky and I hope that Zelensky, I thought it might be [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=15.64s)]
*  easier to deal with Zelensky. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=20.16s)]
*  So far it's been harder. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=21.88s)]
*  President Trump is turning up the pressure on Ukraine to agree to a plan his administration [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=23.7s)]
*  drew up to end the war with Russia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=28.16s)]
*  Under the proposal, Russia would essentially get all of the land that it's taken since [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=30.98s)]
*  invading Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=35.16s)]
*  In exchange, Ukraine would only get vague security assurances. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=36.9s)]
*  The plan would also explicitly block Ukraine from ever joining NATO, a concession Russia [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=41.22s)]
*  has long called for. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  But Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky, quickly rejected the Trump administration's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=48.74s)]
*  proposal, saying, quote, This is our territory. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=53.36s)]
*  President Zelensky's reaction and his rejection, his total rejection of the idea, is not surprising [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=57.04s)]
*  given the fact that the American proposal is so positive for Russia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=62.8s)]
*  My colleague Michael Shear has been reporting on the Trump administration's role in negotiations [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=67.84s)]
*  to stop the fighting. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=71.72s)]
*  The motivation for the Trump administration behind pushing this peace plan is a little [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=73.34s)]
*  bit unclear. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=77.48s)]
*  One possibility is that they really are trying to push President Zelensky into a deal that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=79.2s)]
*  Ukrainians don't really approve of. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=85.12s)]
*  But the other possibility is that this is mostly a pretext. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=88.36s)]
*  President Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President Vance, they've all been [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=92.2s)]
*  talking in recent weeks about just walking away from the peace process, saying that, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  you know, it's too difficult to get these parties back together. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=103.84s)]
*  And so it's just possible that proposing a plan that is this bad from the perspective [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=107.7s)]
*  of the Ukrainians means that it's basically dead in the water, that it's not really about [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=112.0s)]
*  moving forward with the peace plan, but it's really about setting the stage for the U.S. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=117.48s)]
*  to wash its hands of the crisis and just walk away from the war. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=122.2s)]
*  Meanwhile in Ukraine, people scrambled for shelter overnight as Russian forces launched [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  a major missile and drone attack on the country's capital city. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=137.16s)]
*  The strikes were the deadliest attack on Kiev in almost a year. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=140.96s)]
*  At least nine people were killed, more than 60 were injured. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=144.6s)]
*  Yesterday a flashy announcement went up online promising what it called the most exclusive [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=154.32s)]
*  invitation in the world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=159.8s)]
*  The pitch? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=161.72s)]
*  Buy enough of President Trump's meme coin, a form of cryptocurrency, and you'll get [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=162.72s)]
*  the offer may be the Trump family's most explicit effort yet to profit from crypto. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=168.52s)]
*  The president launched the coin just before inauguration day and holds a large number [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=177.16000000000003s)]
*  of them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  He and his business partners personally make money every time it's traded. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  That earned them nearly a hundred million dollars in just the first few weeks of his [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=186.88s)]
*  presidency. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  The news of the offer spread yesterday. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=192.62s)]
*  The meme coins price surged more than 60% as people rushed to buy enough to win their [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=194.5s)]
*  spot. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=200.18s)]
*  The top 220 coin holders will get the invite for the dinner next month. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=201.3s)]
*  There's even a leaderboard now up on the coin's website. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=206.02s)]
*  The Trump family's embrace of cryptocurrency has come as the president's moved to scale [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=209.34s)]
*  back enforcement of regulations on the industry. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=214.38s)]
*  It's also amplified major ethical concerns that Trump is essentially asking people to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=217.98s)]
*  pay for access to the White House and is directly profiting from his presidency. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=223.66s)]
*  One former official who oversaw crypto policy under President Biden said, quote, they are [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  making the pay to play deal explicit. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=234.7s)]
*  The Department of the Interior says it will fast track new projects involving coal, oil, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=237.42s)]
*  gas, and minerals on public lands and that it will radically reduce the review periods [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=251.98s)]
*  required by law. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=257.74s)]
*  Environmental reviews that normally take a year to complete and give the public a chance [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=260.02s)]
*  will now be finished in just two weeks. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  It's a move that developers and builders have long called for, saying that the existing [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=268.14s)]
*  review process is too long and too expensive. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=272.62s)]
*  The Interior Department says it has the authority to make this drastic change because President [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  Trump declared a national energy emergency, saying the country's resources are insufficient. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  But dozens of energy experts say there is no emergency. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=287.34s)]
*  They point out that the U.S. already produces more energy than it consumes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=291.1s)]
*  It's both the world's largest producer of oil and the largest exporter of natural gas. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=295.82s)]
*  And in one last Trump update for today, a new Times analysis of national opinion polls [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=303.98s)]
*  gives a snapshot of how Americans feel about the president three months in. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=308.82s)]
*  Overall, Trump's approval rating has dropped to about 44 percent, down from 52 percent [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  in his first week. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=320.66s)]
*  Much of that drop appears to have been driven by independent voters. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=322.38s)]
*  Among Republicans, there's been little drop in support for the president, though experts [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  say it's still too soon to measure how voters feel about some of Trump's most disruptive [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  policies like his aggressive new tariffs. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=335.38s)]
*  The full polling tracker, which is updated daily, is at NYTimes.com. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=338.66s)]
*  This week, India and Pakistan are on edge after a terrorist attack killed more than [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=349.38000000000005s)]
*  two dozen Indian tourists. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=354.54s)]
*  The attack happened in Kashmir, a disputed territory that both countries, who are longtime [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  adversaries, control parts of. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=362.06s)]
*  Indian gunmen opened fire at a vacation area there that people have dubbed mini-Switzerland [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=364.9s)]
*  with its picturesque mountains and valleys. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  While India hasn't officially blamed any group for the massacre, it's retaliated against [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=372.85999999999996s)]
*  Pakistan, claiming the country harbors and supports terrorists. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  It shut a key border crossing between the two countries, among other measures, and India's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  defense minister hinted at the possibility of military strikes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  Pakistan, meanwhile, expressed condolences for the victims' families and has said it [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=392.06s)]
*  does not support any form of terrorism. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=396.86s)]
*  A few years ago, another militant attack in Kashmir sparked an air battle between India [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=399.98s)]
*  and Pakistan that stopped just short of all-out war. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=404.42s)]
*  And finally, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  This sound will make you fall asleep in six seconds. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  If you search for sleep advice on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=421.98s)]
*  There's actually a military proven technique. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=425.38s)]
*  You'll find an endless scroll of various obscure sleep hacks. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=428.38s)]
*  Here's how you can do it too. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=432.98s)]
*  Caroline Hopkins-Legaspi is part of the team at The Times that asks experts about the real [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=435.18s)]
*  science behind viral health trends. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=439.86s)]
*  She says when it comes to sleep, obviously it's very personal, but the experts she talked [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=442.70000000000005s)]
*  with did nix a few ideas that are all over social media right now, like mouth tape. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=447.36s)]
*  Yes, this is a real thing people are doing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=453.36s)]
*  They are taping their mouths shut to try and stop snoring. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=455.78000000000003s)]
*  But there are also a number of trending sleep suggestions that do get the experts seal of approval. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=459.18s)]
*  Many of these were sort of mental exercises that you can do to get your mind off of, you [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=465.06s)]
*  know, the worries from your day. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=469.54s)]
*  One of these is a hack called cognitive shuffling, where you think of a word, can be any random [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=473.24s)]
*  word, and then you think of the first letter of that word and as many words as you can [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=478.94s)]
*  think of that start with that first letter. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=482.76s)]
*  And when you run out of words, you move on to the next one. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=484.54s)]
*  So for example, say you choose the word apple, you would start with A and think of as many [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=487.38s)]
*  A words as you can, you know, art, air, atrium, then move on to P and think of as many P words [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=491.86s)]
*  as you can, and so on and so forth until you fall asleep. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=498.24s)]
*  Another one that I found kind of fun is this idea of the house tour. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=502.74s)]
*  You imagine a house you know really well. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=506.94s)]
*  It's not your own house, though, somebody's house that you've been in enough times to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=509.04s)]
*  sort of close your eyes and picture every detail of slowly walking up to the door, opening [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=512.72s)]
*  the door, noticing the art on the walls, noticing, you know, the furniture and people on TikTok [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=517.72s)]
*  say they never make it upstairs because they're asleep by the time they get through the first [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  few rooms of the house. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEv-Q4XHDo&t=527.5600000000001s)]
