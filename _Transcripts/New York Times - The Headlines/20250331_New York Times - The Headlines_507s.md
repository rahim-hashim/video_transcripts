# Trump ‘Not Joking’ About Third Term, and the Myanmar Earthquake Toll
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Monday, March 31st. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=7.76s)]
*  Just hours ago, President Trump called me to tell me he is, quote, pissed off with Russia's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=13.88s)]
*  President Putin. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=19.84s)]
*  President Trump gave a sprawling phone interview this weekend to NBC's Kristen Welker. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=21.6s)]
*  Welker described their conversation, which wasn't broadcast, on Meet the Press. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=26.48s)]
*  She said a major focus of the interview was Russia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=30.92s)]
*  Trump is growing impatient with how slowly ceasefire negotiations with Ukraine have been [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=33.8s)]
*  moving and said he's considering tariffs to force Russia to make a deal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=37.88s)]
*  Mr. Trump said 25 percent tariffs on Russian oil could happen any moment and told me he [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=43.0s)]
*  plans to speak with President Putin this week. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  The president also talked about the tariffs he's putting in place on foreign cars and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=50.64s)]
*  car parts. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=54.8s)]
*  Trump said he's not backing down from the plan, even as the stock market has plunged [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=56.48s)]
*  in response. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=60.76s)]
*  And on fears of foreign automakers raising prices, quote, I couldn't care less if they [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  raise prices because people are going to start buying American made cars. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump acknowledging that prices might go up was a rare admission that his economic policy [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=71.28s)]
*  could cause economic hardship for Americans. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=76.08s)]
*  In the interview, the president also claimed that a lot of people want him to serve a third [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=79.32s)]
*  term, even though the Constitution says he can't. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=84.0s)]
*  When Walker said that was something she heard him joke about a lot, the president said, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=87.72s)]
*  quote, No, no, I'm not joking. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=91.8s)]
*  I'm not joking. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=93.8s)]
*  Though he also said he was focused on his current term at the moment. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=94.8s)]
*  Over the weekend, the Trump administration also doubled down on its insistence that the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=102.64s)]
*  U.S. will take control of Greenland. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=107.12s)]
*  Vice President J.D. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=109.84s)]
*  Vance made a three hour long visit to the island. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=110.84s)]
*  A U.S. delegation was originally supposed to take a much longer trip that would have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=113.76s)]
*  included stops at cultural sites and a dog sled race, but that was scrapped after local [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=117.36s)]
*  residents said they planned a protest. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  Instead, Vance only visited a U.S. military base there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  In a speech, he framed the region as critical for U.S. national security. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=128.8s)]
*  We know that Russia and China and other nations are taking an extraordinary interest in Arctic [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  passageways and Arctic naval routes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=139.08s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance also took aim at Denmark, which largely oversees Greenland. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=142.2s)]
*  Our message to Denmark is very simple. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=146.84s)]
*  You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=149.48s)]
*  You have under invested in the people of Greenland. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=153.28s)]
*  That has to change. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=155.92s)]
*  In response to the Trump administration's repeated assertions that the U.S. will get [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=157.44s)]
*  Greenland, the territory's prime minister said yesterday, quote, Let me be clear. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=161.84s)]
*  The United States will not get it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=167.12s)]
*  We do not belong to anyone else. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  We decide our own future. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=171.04s)]
*  In Myanmar, rescue teams have been using sledgehammers and drills to dig through collapsed buildings [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=180.44s)]
*  and look for survivors after a powerful earthquake shook the country on Friday. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=188.28s)]
*  More than 1,700 people have been killed, according to officials there, and the death toll is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  expected to rise significantly. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=198.16s)]
*  In the aftermath of the quake, the country's military junta, which has avoided asking for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=200.6s)]
*  outside assistance in past disasters, made a rare appeal for help. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=205.6s)]
*  Russia, China, and India quickly sent in rescue teams. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  But for the moment, the U.S., which used to be a leader in foreign aid, appears to have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  sent nothing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  While the American embassy in Myanmar said the U.S. plans to provide $2 million in assistance, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=220.92s)]
*  many of the programs that would have helped actually distribute that aid have been disrupted [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=226.68s)]
*  by the Trump administration. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=230.84s)]
*  And in Washington, a handful of USAID employees who were trying to coordinate a response to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=232.96s)]
*  the quake got emails as they were in the middle of their work telling them they were laid [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=238.36s)]
*  off. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=242.84s)]
*  A former top official at USAID told the Times that the lack of support could undermine America's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=243.84s)]
*  relationships in the region. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=249.44s)]
*  He said, quote, If we don't show up and China shows up, that sends a pretty strong message. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=251.48s)]
*  In Haiti, for over a year now, gangs have been terrorizing the country's capital city. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=265.84s)]
*  They've taken over whole neighborhoods, murdered hundreds of people with impunity, and Haiti's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=270.96s)]
*  police force has been overwhelmed, in part because they're essentially outgunned. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Experts say that there are up to half a million illegal firearms in the streets in Haiti. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=281.24s)]
*  And the big question is, how do they get there? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=289.04s)]
*  Frances Robles, along with her colleague David Adams, are part of the team covering Haiti [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=292.24s)]
*  for the Times. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  They've been reporting on how the country has been flooded with weapons, despite the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=298.0s)]
*  fact that it's illegal to ship any there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  Frances says that experts they talk to say that most of the weapons are coming from the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=305.12s)]
*  U.S. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  One of the most common methods for smuggling guns is the use of straw buyers. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=310.88s)]
*  And that's where a person in the United States goes to a gun store or a gun website and just [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=316.11999999999995s)]
*  buys them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=322.67999999999995s)]
*  And so a person who is illegally shipping guns to Haiti will get various straw buyers [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=323.88s)]
*  to make these purchases for them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=330.64s)]
*  They gather all the loot and then they send them by freighter to Haiti. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=332.32s)]
*  The shipments are really hard to track because they usually go out on these freighters that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=337.24s)]
*  leave South Florida and they're packed with stuff. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=342.52s)]
*  I mean, they're packed with used clothes and bicycles and all kinds of things. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=346.24s)]
*  And in most countries, customs inspect the packages and shipments coming in. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=352.36s)]
*  They don't really inspect very much of the ones going out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=357.08s)]
*  So very, very few of these shipments get caught. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  Frances says Haiti is not alone in being overrun by American weapons. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=365.88s)]
*  Many countries across Latin America are dealing with the same issue. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=370.88s)]
*  In Mexico, for example, most of the guns recovered from crime scenes come from the United States. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=374.88s)]
*  And finally, in 1999, Tony Hawk did what seemed impossible. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=387.76s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=394.48s)]
*  The skateboarder launched himself up off the halfpipe and completed a 900, a trick named [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  for the number of degrees he spun around in the air. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=402.72s)]
*  He turned his body a full two and a half times while off the ground and then landed on his [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=405.8s)]
*  board smoothly. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  Now almost 30 years later, officials are set to decide whether people can try a trick like [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  that in the Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  Despite all the excitement back when Hawk pulled off the trick, the 900 belongs to vert [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=421.72s)]
*  skateboarding, a niche form of the sport which has fallen out of the spotlight as park and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  street style skateboarding has become more popular. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=432.6s)]
*  They're easier to learn, no giant ramps necessary. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=435.76000000000005s)]
*  So while skateboarding has been featured in the last two Olympic Games, vert skateboarding [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=439.44000000000005s)]
*  with its big air moves has not been. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=444.24s)]
*  But a younger crop of skaters wants to change that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=447.12s)]
*  They've been tackling the tricks faster than even Hawk can comprehend. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=450.2s)]
*  The 900 was a lifelong goal for him. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=454.44s)]
*  And there are now skaters who've landed the trick at age 12. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=457.08s)]
*  Hawk told the Times that some of that's because skaters are now starting younger than ever. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=460.92s)]
*  Where kids used to be told skateboarding was a bad influence, now they're encouraged. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=466.36s)]
*  There's whole dedicated training facilities. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=471.0s)]
*  Olympic officials will make their decision next week about whether there will be a vert [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  event at the Summer Games. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  Hawk has even offered to supply the ramp. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=480.24s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=486.44s)]
*  How the Trump administration is targeting students on college campuses for deportation. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=489.12s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=494.64s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lLGEdzNnT4&t=500.52000000000004s)]
