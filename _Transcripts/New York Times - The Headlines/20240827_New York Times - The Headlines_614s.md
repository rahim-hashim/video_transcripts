# Russia Pounds Wide Swath of Ukraine, and F.T.C. Fights Grocery Merger
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=5.2s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, August 27th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=6.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=8.84s)]
*  Could you tell us what you know about this latest attack in terms of the scale of it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=15.52s)]
*  and what was hit? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=19.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=20.96s)]
*  So over the past 24 hours, Russia unleashed what is, by all estimates, one of the largest [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=21.96s)]
*  missile and drone bombardments of the war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=28.0s)]
*  The Russians fired cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, drones from inside Russia, from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=30.6s)]
*  the Black Sea, from Crimea, at targets across Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=35.8s)]
*  Times reporter Mark Santora has been covering Russia's latest barrage of attacks against [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=40.36s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=45.36s)]
*  He says the bombardment sent Ukrainians scrambling for shelter in Kyiv's subway system and in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=46.36s)]
*  basements across the country, as Russia took specific aim at Ukraine's energy infrastructure. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=51.96s)]
*  In these Russian bombardments of the Ukrainian energy grid, they've gone after basically [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=59.4s)]
*  everything that can generate power. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=62.8s)]
*  Thermal power plants, they've gone after the substations that bring that power across the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=64.76s)]
*  country, they've gone after hydroelectric plants. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=69.36s)]
*  Obviously, we don't know the Kremlin's thinking behind each and every move they do, but we [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=72.48s)]
*  do know broadly that by going after the energy infrastructure, they're not just making life [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=76.36s)]
*  miserable for millions of Ukrainians, but they're hoping to do serious damage to the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=81.56s)]
*  economy, for instance, to the industries that make the Ukrainian arms industry work, to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=85.72s)]
*  a number of things. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=91.36s)]
*  These Russian attacks, at their core, are basically aimed at bringing down the Ukrainian [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=93.0s)]
*  state's ability to function. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  In the immediate aftermath of these attacks, you saw Ukraine raise a point they've raised [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=101.04s)]
*  many times. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=104.68s)]
*  The only way to really stop and thwart these attacks, they say, is to go after these Russian [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=106.24s)]
*  warplanes and bombers at the bases before they take off. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=111.66s)]
*  They call it going after the archer rather than the arrow, because if you try and shoot [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=115.08s)]
*  down 100 arrows, inevitably some get through, but if you take out the archer, you don't [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=119.08s)]
*  have the arrow. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=125.08s)]
*  That's their argument. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=126.08s)]
*  So far, the Biden administration, while allowing Ukraine to use some of its Western-supplied [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  weaponry in the cross-border attack into Russia, is not allowing Ukraine to use long-range [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=132.67999999999998s)]
*  strike weapons to hit Russian air bases far from the front. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  Concerned, they say, that Moscow might view the use of Western weapons to target Russian [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  air bases as an escalation of sorts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=148.55999999999997s)]
*  So it remains to be seen if this latest wave of attacks will shift the Biden administration's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=152.0s)]
*  thinking at this moment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=157.48s)]
*  Federal prosecutors are trying to resurrect the classified documents case against Donald [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=162.64s)]
*  Trump after a judge dismissed it last month. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=171.72s)]
*  Trump was charged with illegally holding onto national security materials after he left [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=175.64s)]
*  the White House and with obstructing the government's efforts to get them back. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=179.6s)]
*  The case was brought by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by the attorney general [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=184.76s)]
*  to investigate the former president. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  Judge Aileen Cannon, who was put on the bench by Trump, threw the case out, saying Smith [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=191.92s)]
*  was appointed to his job illegally. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=197.92s)]
*  She ruled his appointment should have been confirmed by the Senate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  Her decision was a major legal victory for Trump and stunned many experts. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  It flew in the face of previous court decisions about special prosecutors going back to the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  Watergate era. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=213.72s)]
*  Now, Smith's team has filed a brief arguing the case shouldn't have been thrown out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  They point to four statutes they say give the attorney general the authority to name [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=220.64s)]
*  special counsels. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  The prosecution is also arguing that Judge Cannon's decision could call into question [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  hundreds of appointments and could, quote, jeopardize the longstanding operation of the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  Justice Department. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  The filing is just the beginning of a legal battle that's likely to stretch well beyond [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  the election and may end up at the Supreme Court. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=242.64s)]
*  You know, the deal was we keep the same rules. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=251.64s)]
*  Now all of a sudden they want to make a change in the rules because she can't answer questions. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump and Kamala Harris's campaigns are squabbling over the details of their upcoming [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  presidential debate. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  The two are set to face off on September 10th in a 90-minute debate hosted by ABC. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=264.91999999999996s)]
*  It will be the first time they've ever debated each other, and right now no other debates [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=270.76s)]
*  are scheduled, meaning it could be voters' only chance to see the candidates side by [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=274.4s)]
*  side before the election. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  But yesterday, Trump suggested maybe he won't show up. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=281.8s)]
*  I think ABC really should be shut out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  I'd much rather do it on NBC. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=287.72s)]
*  I'd much rather do it on CBS, frankly. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  The former president has claimed that ABC's anchors and executives are biased against [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  He said his first choice would be to debate on Fox News. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  The Harris campaign is also lobbying to change a detail of the debate. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=303.54s)]
*  It wants both candidates to have their mics on the whole time, no muting. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=308.1s)]
*  Previously, when Joe Biden was the Democratic candidate, his team pushed hard that candidates [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  should be muted when it wasn't their turn, arguing that Trump couldn't be trusted not [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=317.82000000000005s)]
*  to talk over Biden. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=322.3s)]
*  The Harris campaign has now changed course, hoping that an unmuted Trump will play to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=324.5s)]
*  her favor. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=329.74s)]
*  Harris had a standout moment in 2020 when Mike Pence interrupted her in a debate, and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=331.38s)]
*  she shot back with an icy, I'm speaking. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=336.84s)]
*  So far this year, the presidential debate in June between Biden and Trump was the most [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  watched event of the race so far. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=345.7s)]
*  More than 51 million Americans watched it live. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=348.48s)]
*  In court in Oregon yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission and the two largest supermarket [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=356.5s)]
*  chains in the U.S. squared off in a fight over a potential merger that could have huge [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=361.82s)]
*  consequences for both shoppers and grocery store workers. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=367.3s)]
*  Kroger, which owns brands like Ralph's and Harris Teeter, has been trying to complete [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=371.42s)]
*  the biggest supermarket takeover in American history by acquiring Albertsons, which owns [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=376.02s)]
*  Safeway and Vons. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=381.78s)]
*  But the FTC is stepping in to try and block that merger, and the grocery chains are pushing [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=383.94s)]
*  back. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=389.34s)]
*  I think the reason this deal is getting so much attention is the fact that this is groceries, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=390.34s)]
*  this is the stuff people really rely on. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=394.9s)]
*  So it is a case that fundamentally, and the way the government is framing it is about [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  whether it will get harder for Americans to feed their families. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=401.06s)]
*  Daniel Kay is a business reporter at the Times. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=404.58s)]
*  The FTC in its case is essentially saying there are two main groups that would be likely [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  harmed by this deal. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  The big one is consumers, right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=416.38s)]
*  Just everyday shoppers. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=419.06s)]
*  And on that front, the government is saying consumers would likely see prices go up, and [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=420.52s)]
*  some communities might even face the possibility of expanding food deserts and just less options [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=425.82s)]
*  for fresh food. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=431.46s)]
*  So that's sort of on the consumer side of things. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=432.54s)]
*  The government is also saying that workers could be harmed by this deal, and Kroger and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=435.18s)]
*  Albertsons employ 700,000 people total. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=440.62s)]
*  They're saying grocery workers, especially unionized grocery workers, could see a hit [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=444.18s)]
*  to their wages and benefits if this deal were to go through. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=448.74s)]
*  While the FTC is saying this will reduce competition in a lot of markets across the country, the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=452.14s)]
*  companies are saying, no, actually, this is pro-competitive. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=457.94s)]
*  We need this deal in order to compete with the even bigger players. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=461.06s)]
*  And without this deal, actually, prices will keep going up. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=465.26s)]
*  I think the key part of their argument is portraying traditional supermarkets like Kroger [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=469.02s)]
*  and Albertsons as kind of the underdog, as we see Amazon, Walmart, Costco, these major [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=473.34s)]
*  retailers, non-traditional retailers, get more and more of an inroad into grocery. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  These major players are the bigger culprits here, and we need to compete against them. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=485.29999999999995s)]
*  And finally, for guys whose party trick is playing Wonderwall on the acoustic guitar [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=490.26s)]
*  in the corner, today is a big day. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=504.14s)]
*  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=507.02s)]
*  The British band Oasis has announced a reunion tour that some people never thought would [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=511.61999999999995s)]
*  happen. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOxHRZd-1Zo&t=516.42s)]
