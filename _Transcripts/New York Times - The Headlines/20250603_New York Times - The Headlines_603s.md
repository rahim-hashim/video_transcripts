# Concerns Over Trump’s Science Cuts, Israel Fires Near Gaza Aid Site, Coffee’s Perks | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, June 3rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=8.0s)]
*  This morning in Gaza, the Israeli military said its soldiers opened fire near crowds [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=14.18s)]
*  of Palestinians walking toward a new food distribution site. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=18.8s)]
*  According to Gaza health officials, at least 27 people were killed and dozens were injured. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=23.22s)]
*  The Israeli military said it fired at people who strayed from the designated route, saying [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=28.62s)]
*  they posed a threat to soldiers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=33.58s)]
*  But a military spokeswoman declined to offer details. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=35.82s)]
*  A doctor at a nearby hospital a few miles from the site told the Times most of the victims [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=39.02s)]
*  they received there were children aged between 10 and 13, many with gunshot wounds to the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=44.22s)]
*  head or chest. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  He said their bodies were carried much of the way to the hospital because ambulances [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=50.7s)]
*  could not safely reach the area where the shooting occurred. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=54.56s)]
*  It's the second time in three days Israeli soldiers have opened fire along a route to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=58.18s)]
*  this aid site. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=62.38s)]
*  Palestinian officials said 23 people were killed Sunday. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=64.18s)]
*  The location is part of the contentious new system for distributing aid in Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=67.54s)]
*  Hundreds of locations run by humanitarian groups were replaced with just four controlled [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=72.18s)]
*  by foreign contractors. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=77.22s)]
*  That's forced many Palestinians to travel for miles and cross Israeli military lines [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=79.38s)]
*  to get aid. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=84.34s)]
*  In Washington. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=88.1s)]
*  This president, we're kicking off the June work period today. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=90.82s)]
*  It's going to be a busy month. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=94.66s)]
*  We have a lot to get done. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=96.82s)]
*  Senators are back from recess and will soon take up President Trump's massive domestic [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=98.82s)]
*  policy bill, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  The package, which already passed the House, slashes multiple federal programs in order [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=107.16s)]
*  to offset the costs of the president's priorities, including tax breaks and increased immigration [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=117.38s)]
*  There's been intense pushback even from some Republicans about the scale of the planned [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=118.74s)]
*  cuts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=123.22s)]
*  And the Times has found that Trump and his allies have been using falsehoods and inaccurate [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=124.22s)]
*  claims to try and promote the bill to the public. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=128.98s)]
*  We are not cutting Medicaid in this package. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=131.78s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation out there about this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=134.82s)]
*  In one case, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump have both said the bill contains no [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=138.3s)]
*  significant cuts to Medicaid. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=143.12s)]
*  The only thing we're cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=145.34s)]
*  We're not changing Medicaid. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=148.54s)]
*  But the bill cuts hundreds of billions of dollars of Medicaid spending and will leave [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  an estimated 10 million people without coverage over the next decade. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=154.46s)]
*  And when it comes to the bill's impact on the federal deficit, White House press secretary [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=158.1s)]
*  Caroline Levitt said it would bring the country's debt down. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  By carrying out the largest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years with $1.6 trillion in mandatory [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=166.38s)]
*  savings. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=173.26s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency, disagrees. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=174.26s)]
*  Analysts there estimated the bill would actually add almost $4 trillion to the deficit, even [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=179.22s)]
*  after they factored in economic growth. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=184.42s)]
*  Levitt accused the office of using, quote, shoddy assumptions. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  But its projections have historically been more or less accurate. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=190.78s)]
*  And several other budget models have made similar predictions about the bill. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=194.06s)]
*  Now, three more updates on the Trump administration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=198.7s)]
*  After losing nearly 600 employees to the recent federal staffing cuts, the National Weather [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  Service is now trying to hire another hundred or so to, quote, stabilize the department. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=210.94s)]
*  Some forecasting offices no longer have enough staff to operate overnight when they used [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=217.26s)]
*  to be 24-7. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=221.78s)]
*  Others cut back on critical data collection that fed forecast models. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=223.78s)]
*  The restaffing plan comes just as forecasters are gearing up for hurricane season in the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=228.16s)]
*  Atlantic, which started Sunday. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=233.32s)]
*  On that topic, the acting head of FEMA told staff he didn't know the U.S. had a hurricane [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=236.24s)]
*  season. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=241.44s)]
*  Two staffers told the Times it was unclear if he was serious. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=242.64s)]
*  The agency has said he was joking. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=245.8s)]
*  Also, a Senate committee will hold a confirmation hearing today on President Trump's pick to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=248.76s)]
*  lead the U.S. Forest Service, Michael Boren. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=254.4s)]
*  He's the founder of a billion-dollar tech company and a Trump donor who has clashed [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=258.04s)]
*  with the service for years. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  He's been accused of putting a cabin on federal land, flying a helicopter so close to a crew [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=264.24s)]
*  that was out building trails that officials sought a restraining order, and building a [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=269.6s)]
*  private airstrip without a permit in a national recreation area. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  While Boren owns a large ranch in Idaho, he has little experience in public lands management. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  If confirmed, Boren would be charged with carrying out the president's executive order [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=285.04s)]
*  to increase logging in national forests. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=288.6s)]
*  And across the country, scientists are increasingly concerned that American research labs may [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=293.6s)]
*  no longer be able to attract the world's best and brightest under the Trump administration. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=298.54s)]
*  Federal science budgets have been slashed, grants have been frozen mid-experiment, and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=303.62s)]
*  stricter immigration policies have targeted many international students. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=308.44s)]
*  It's not that uncommon to go into a scientific lab in the United States and find that there [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=312.52s)]
*  are more students from China working there as graduate students and postdocs than there [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=316.2s)]
*  are American-born citizens. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=320.4s)]
*  My colleague Kate Zernike has been talking with researchers who say America's status [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  as an international science mecca was carefully and intentionally cultivated going back to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  the 1950s. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=332.2s)]
*  Now, the system that delivered breakthrough after breakthrough in tech, physics, healthcare, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=333.2s)]
*  you name it, is under stress. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  That talent is going to either be forced to go home or they're just going to look elsewhere [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  for jobs. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=344.8s)]
*  In France and Germany, some of the most prominent institutions of science are already adding [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=346.06s)]
*  extra money to their budgets and saying, if you've lost your grants, come work with us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=350.14s)]
*  We have money for you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=354.76s)]
*  China is also on a hiring spree. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=356.54s)]
*  And so what researchers I've talked to are really concerned about is that the United [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  States will actually increasingly be isolated from the rest of the scientific community [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=362.38s)]
*  and ultimately lose its preeminence in science. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=367.18s)]
*  For anyone drinking coffee right now, prepare to be validated. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=370.86s)]
*  A new study found that coffee may help with healthy aging on top of that caffeine fix. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  The data was presented yesterday at the annual meeting for the American Society for Nutrition. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=388.7s)]
*  It hasn't been peer-reviewed yet, but the study was rigorous and extensive. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  It followed more than 47,000 female nurses starting in the 1970s. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=397.64s)]
*  Over several decades, they were asked questions about their diets, like how much coffee, tea, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=402.84s)]
*  or soda like Coca-Cola and Pepsi they drank. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=407.74s)]
*  Ultimately, the group who consumed the most caffeine had 13% higher odds of healthy aging [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=410.44s)]
*  than those who consumed the least. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  The study defined healthy aging as no cognitive impairment and no cancer, type 2 diabetes, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=420.2s)]
*  heart disease, or other chronic diseases. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=425.6s)]
*  They did not find the same association between healthy aging and drinking tea or decaf coffee, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=428.16s)]
*  and drinking cola was associated with significantly decreased odds of healthy aging. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=433.72s)]
*  The findings add to a large body of evidence linking coffee consumption with longevity, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=440.0s)]
*  though some studies suggest that benefit can disappear if people regularly add more than [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=444.68s)]
*  sugar or about one tablespoon of half and half to their coffee. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=451.0s)]
*  And finally, it is summer book season, and every year, the Times puts out its list of [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=458.8s)]
*  the latest releases not to miss, from breezy beach reads to riveting nonfiction. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=463.64s)]
*  The editor of the Times Book Review, Gilbert Cruz, has narrowed down his list to just a [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=469.54s)]
*  few favorites. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=474.68s)]
*  The first is called King of Ashes. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=476.2s)]
*  This is by S.A. Cosby, a crime writer who's written four crime novels set in the South [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=479.32s)]
*  in Virginia. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2yRdmpZ3T4&t=485.24s)]
