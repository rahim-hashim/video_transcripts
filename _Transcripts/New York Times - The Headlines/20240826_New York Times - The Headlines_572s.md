# Israel and Hezbollah Trade Airstrikes, and U.S. Border Crossings Drop
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=5.0s)]
*  Today is Monday, August 26th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=8.0s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah fired back and forth over the Israel-Lebanon border this weekend, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=15.0s)]
*  in one of the biggest barrages in months. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=19.92s)]
*  It was an exchange that many in the region have been holding their breath for. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=22.88s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah have been locked in a waiting game since last month, when Israel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=27.56s)]
*  killed one of the militant group's top commanders in Beirut, and Hezbollah vowed to retaliate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=31.64s)]
*  For now, the exchange has not risen to the level of major escalation that many had feared. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=38.48s)]
*  Lebanon reported three deaths. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=44.4s)]
*  Israel won. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=46.2s)]
*  Both sides called their operations a success. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=47.84s)]
*  Israel says it struck preemptively to thwart a bigger attack, and Hezbollah says it followed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=51.36s)]
*  through on its promise of retaliation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=56.36s)]
*  The attacks underscore how tensions over the war in Gaza continue to consume the wider [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=59.44s)]
*  region. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=64.96s)]
*  Hezbollah's been firing on Israel since October in solidarity with Hamas, and Israel's still [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=65.96s)]
*  braced for retaliation from Iran for the assassination of a Hamas leader in the country's capital. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=72.12s)]
*  The strikes on Sunday also raised the stakes for the ceasefire negotiators currently gathered [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=79.36s)]
*  in Cairo, trying to broker a deal to end the war in Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=84.64s)]
*  The hope is that a deal there could bring down temperatures across the region. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=89.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, diplomats involved in the ceasefire negotiations say Hamas insists they need the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=95.84s)]
*  input of their political leader before they can make any major decisions in the talks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=104.52s)]
*  That leader is Yahya Sinwar, who has been commanding the group from inside Gaza. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=110.52s)]
*  He's both a crucial figure in their decision making and a top military target for Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  It's not an exaggeration that Sinwar is one of the most wanted men on earth right now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=122.88s)]
*  Times reporter Mark Mazzetti has been covering Israel's hunt for Sinwar, which the U.S. has [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=127.28s)]
*  been closely involved with. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=131.92s)]
*  For the Israelis and the United States, it's frustrating because there are sort of episodic [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=133.92s)]
*  cases of getting close. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=139.36s)]
*  In the early months after October 7th, Sinwar was using electric communications that they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  were able to monitor at some points. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  For example, there was a raid on January 31st where Israeli commandos went into a bunker [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=151.28s)]
*  that they believed Sinwar was in. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  It turns out he had been there, but he had left days earlier, possibly because he had [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=160.28000000000003s)]
*  been tipped that the Israelis knew of his location. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  In more recent months, he's basically gone totally off the grid. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=169.0s)]
*  He doesn't use electronic communications, and he relies on this network of human couriers [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=173.12s)]
*  to receive messages and to send messages. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=179.45999999999998s)]
*  I think what's particularly interesting in this case is that this is not just some terrorist [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  leader who can go off the grid and hide for months and years on end to evade capture. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=188.4s)]
*  This is someone who is not only running a war in Gaza, but he's also central to the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=193.9s)]
*  ongoing negotiations. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=200.22s)]
*  And so he has to be actively engaged with his subordinates in order to carry on these [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=202.3s)]
*  many different roles. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=208.38s)]
*  It's widely believed Sinwar is still underground in tunnels beneath Gaza, possibly surrounding [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=211.34s)]
*  himself with hostages for protection. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=216.8s)]
*  This summer at the U.S.-Mexico border, the number of crossings has plummeted. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=224.82s)]
*  July had the lowest number of illegal crossings of President Biden's entire term. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of factors at play, including that Mexico has ramped up enforcement and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=235.58s)]
*  stopped more migrants en route to the border. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=240.22s)]
*  But an executive order that Biden signed earlier this summer that restricts asylum also appears [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=243.58s)]
*  to be driving the drop. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=249.18s)]
*  Specifically, one procedural change from that order. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=251.02s)]
*  U.S. border agents no longer have to ask migrants whether they fear for their lives if they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=254.3s)]
*  return home. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=259.74s)]
*  Times immigration reporter Hamid Ali Aziz says this is a major shift. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=261.82s)]
*  Before when migrants would cross illegally, they would be asked whether or not they fear [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  return to their home country, whether they wanted asylum in the United States. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  Migrants often would answer yes. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=276.02s)]
*  And this would kickstart a process that could ultimately allow migrants to stay in the country [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  for years, waiting for their immigration court hearings, waiting for the chance to seek asylum [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=282.62s)]
*  in immigration court. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=287.58s)]
*  Some officials believed that these questions were leading and that they were leading to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=289.28s)]
*  affirmative answers and that now migrants, you know, they'll still have the chance to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=293.97999999999996s)]
*  seek asylum and protection in the United States, but they'll have to voice it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=299.46s)]
*  They'll have to make an affirmative request. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=303.14s)]
*  They'll have to go to the border agent and say they want asylum, that they're fearful [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  of return. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=309.17999999999995s)]
*  Ultimately, it's going to be on the migrant themselves to know when and how to seek asylum [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  and how to kickstart the process. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=317.38s)]
*  Since June, asylum claims have dropped by half, and the majority of migrants are now [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=319.9s)]
*  quickly turned back from the border. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=325.26s)]
*  The Biden administration says that's easing the pressure on the country's overburdened [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=327.94s)]
*  immigration system. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=331.73999999999995s)]
*  But migrant advocates say the policy change is weeding out too many people, including [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=333.7s)]
*  those who should be allowed to have their asylum cases heard. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=339.02s)]
*  They say the new policy is unfair to people in desperate situations who don't know how [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=342.74s)]
*  to ask for help when they cross. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=347.34s)]
*  The founder of one of the biggest messaging apps in the world, Telegram, was arrested [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=356.41999999999996s)]
*  in France over the weekend. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=361.34s)]
*  Pavel Durov, a Russian entrepreneur, is facing charges related to the spread of illicit material [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=363.3s)]
*  on the app, according to French media. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=368.98s)]
*  Telegram has over 900 million users worldwide, and Durov has portrayed himself as a free [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=372.06s)]
*  speech crusader. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=378.42s)]
*  He designed the app to be a secretive and uncensored way to communicate. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=380.5s)]
*  That's allowed people living under authoritarian regimes, for example, to connect and organize. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=384.94s)]
*  It's also made Telegram a haven for disinformation and terrorist propaganda. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=391.26s)]
*  And it's long been on the radar of law enforcement because the app's been used for selling weapons [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=396.38s)]
*  and recruiting members of extremist groups. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=401.26s)]
*  French authorities haven't gone into detail about what Durov is charged with, but the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=404.61999999999995s)]
*  arrest comes as governments, particularly in Europe, have intensified pressure on social [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=408.94s)]
*  media companies to address extremism and the spread of illicit material. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=414.05999999999995s)]
*  In a statement, Telegram says it abides by EU laws and that Durov has nothing to hide. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=419.34s)]
*  Fans of the app and Durov's allies have denounced his arrest. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=425.97999999999996s)]
*  His former press secretary said it was a, quote, monstrous attack on freedom of speech [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=429.88s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  And finally, in less than 24 hours at the Kennedy Space Center, the Polaris Dawn mission [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=441.0s)]
*  is expected to lift off. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=446.79999999999995s)]
*  A spacecraft carrying four crew members is set to travel farther from Earth than anyone [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=448.94s)]
*  has gone since the Apollo Moon missions, more than 50 years ago. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=453.8s)]
*  And everyone on board is a private astronaut. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=458.34s)]
*  There's no one from a national space agency. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=461.78s)]
*  The billionaire Jared Isaacman is leading the Polaris Dawn team. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=464.58s)]
*  He partnered with SpaceX for the mission, which will carry out dozens of scientific [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=468.58s)]
*  experiments in orbit. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=472.46s)]
*  Isaacman's been in space before. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  Three years ago, he was on board the first spacecraft to orbit the Earth without a professional [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=477.22s)]
*  astronaut. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=481.78000000000003s)]
*  This mission will be longer and riskier. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=483.5s)]
*  The ship will be vulnerable to space rocks and debris that could puncture the craft, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=486.38000000000005s)]
*  and it will pass through areas of intense radiation, getting as much exposure in a few [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  hours as the International Space Station does in three months. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=495.38000000000005s)]
*  If everything goes to plan, the mission will also include the first ever spacewalk by a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=500.02000000000004s)]
*  private crew. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=504.90000000000003s)]
*  The plan is to have everyone on board gear up in their spacesuits. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=506.78s)]
*  Next, they will let all of the air out of the ship, literally making the cabin part [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=510.34s)]
*  of the vacuum of outer space. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=515.8199999999999s)]
*  Then, two members of the team will head outside the craft, tethered to move around. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=517.9s)]
*  The entire Polaris Dawn mission is scheduled to last five days. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=523.66s)]
*  But trips to space can get complicated. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=527.9399999999999s)]
*  NASA just officially confirmed this weekend that the astronauts it sent up in June as [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT5pknpJw5g&t=531.18s)]
