# 100,000 Flee Los Angeles Wildfires, and Trump’s Last-Minute Supreme Court Ask
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Thursday, January 9th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=6.36s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=7.84s)]
*  It's as bad as you can imagine. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=10.24s)]
*  It's worse than what you can imagine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=16.6s)]
*  In Los Angeles, four major fires are now burning in and around the city. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=21.48s)]
*  At least five people have died and more than 100,000 people are under mandatory evacuation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=26.08s)]
*  orders. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=31.04s)]
*  The flames are right across the street. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=32.04s)]
*  What is going to mean that it's dangerous enough for you to go? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=34.96s)]
*  I have a one in 100 chance to put out one ember that might burn my house down. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=37.68s)]
*  I'll take the risk on one in 100. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=43.16s)]
*  Despite the orders, some homeowners have stayed behind using garden hoses to spray down their [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=45.72s)]
*  houses. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=50.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=51.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=52.64s)]
*  Some homeowners have come back to their neighborhoods where the fires already swept through to find [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=54.76s)]
*  whole blocks turned to ash. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=58.72s)]
*  It's all gone. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  No. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=64.16s)]
*  The Pacific Palisades fire has destroyed over 1,000 buildings, making it the most destructive [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=65.16s)]
*  in Los Angeles history. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=71.72s)]
*  And a new fire broke out last night, the Sunset Fire in the Hollywood Hills. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  The evacuation zone for that now includes parts of Beverly Hills and some of the city's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=78.64s)]
*  most iconic landmarks, the Hollywood Bowl and the theater where the Oscars are held. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=83.52s)]
*  Last night, people were standing near the Walk of Fame looking up to watch helicopters [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=89.24s)]
*  drop water in the hills. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=93.36s)]
*  But in some of the areas that have been hardest hit, firefighters faced water shortages. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=95.84s)]
*  We saw four times the demands of water that we've ever seen in the system. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=101.42s)]
*  We opened every valve available to push as much water into the Palisades area. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power acknowledged that the system was not built [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=110.8s)]
*  for this level of disaster, which left some people standing by watching their homes burn [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=114.96s)]
*  while firefighters tried to draw from empty hydrants. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Fire hydrants are not made to fight multiple houses, hundreds of houses at a time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=123.84s)]
*  They're made to fight one or two houses when they come in. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=129.48s)]
*  So you're fighting a wildfire with a fire hydrant system. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=132.72s)]
*  For more about the wildfires, including what's made them so fast and so destructive, listen [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=140.72s)]
*  to today's episode of The Daily. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=145.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's legal team has filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court asking [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=161.04s)]
*  the justices to shut down the New York hush money case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=165.96s)]
*  Trump's supposed to be sentenced in the case tomorrow. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=169.96s)]
*  He was convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying records to cover up a sex scandal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=172.72s)]
*  He's not expected to get jail time or even probation, but sentencing will formalize his [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=177.96s)]
*  status as a felon. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=182.9s)]
*  Trump's legal team is arguing that that could complicate his presidential duties if there [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=185.24s)]
*  were to be any restrictions on travel, for example. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=189.36s)]
*  They're also arguing that the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity should apply [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=192.4s)]
*  the lower courts have disagreed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  After Trump's filing, the Supreme Court asked prosecutors to respond by this morning, signaling [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=200.16s)]
*  that the justices could act quickly before sentencing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito talked with Trump on the phone not long before [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=210.08s)]
*  Trump's lawyers filed the emergency application. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=217.24s)]
*  Alito, who is part of the court's conservative majority, said in a statement that it was [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  a routine reference check call for one of his former law clerks who Trump is considering [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=224.68s)]
*  hiring for a government position. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=229.24s)]
*  It's not clear, however, why Trump would be doing reference check calls himself, generally [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=231.56s)]
*  a task for his aides. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=236.28s)]
*  Alito said that he and Trump did not discuss the hush money case or any other matter related [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=238.52s)]
*  to the president-elect that might come in front of the court. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=243.8s)]
*  But the call adds to ethics questions that have been swirling around the justices, including [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=246.72s)]
*  about undisclosed gifts and about a flag flown outside of Alito's home that was the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=251.64s)]
*  same design carried by rioters on January 6th. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  Today is officially a national day of mourning as Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=266.47999999999996s)]
*  United States, is laid to rest. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=271.47999999999996s)]
*  The New York Stock Exchange and many federal offices are closed, so are post offices. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=274.0s)]
*  There won't be any mail today. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=278.68s)]
*  In Washington, D.C. this morning, Presidents Biden, Trump, Obama, Bush, and Clinton are [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=280.88s)]
*  all expected to attend Carter's funeral service at the National Cathedral. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=286.68s)]
*  Biden will deliver a eulogy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=290.92s)]
*  In the afternoon, Carter's casket will be flown to Plains, Georgia, his longtime home, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=293.2s)]
*  for a private service and burial. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=298.4s)]
*  It will mark the end of several days of ceremonies across multiple cities that have given Americans [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=300.84s)]
*  the chance to pay their respects to the former president. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=305.84s)]
*  What is something that stood out to you about President Carter and what brought you here [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=309.32s)]
*  today? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=313.88s)]
*  His faith. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=314.88s)]
*  His faith and how that led him and guided him. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=315.88s)]
*  My colleague Maya Miller spoke with people as they filed through the U.S. Capitol building [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=319.4s)]
*  this week, where Carter was lying in state. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=323.04s)]
*  From what I've read about him, you know, he was a peanut farmer from Georgia, which [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=325.44s)]
*  is just like me, you know, a regular man, regular person who did a lot of right things [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=329.36s)]
*  and put his country first. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=334.48s)]
*  He was just like a kind man, very simple and just down to earth. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  Role model for us. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=342.16s)]
*  Yeah, role model for us. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=343.16s)]
*  We've tried to live our lives that way. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=344.16s)]
*  When I went in the Navy at 18 years old, President Carter was at the end of his term. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=346.48s)]
*  And even then at a young age, he inspired me to go into the service because I thought [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=351.36s)]
*  he was the most decent public figure that I'd ever seen. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  And to this day, he remains the most decent person that I think many of us have ever known. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=359.6s)]
*  The Israeli military announced yesterday that it's recovered the body of another hostage [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=366.48s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  Officials say they found Yusuf Azeedna, a man in his 50s, dead in an underground tunnel, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=384.96000000000004s)]
*  along with what they believe are the bodies of his Hamas guards. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=390.04s)]
*  They did not say how any of them were killed. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  Azeedna and three of his children were abducted during the October 7th attacks from a kibbutz [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=395.96s)]
*  where they'd been working. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=400.56s)]
*  The youngest two, who were teenagers, were later released. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  But Azeedna and his son Hamza, who was in his early 20s, remained in captivity. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  The Israeli military said they have serious concerns about Hamza's well-being too. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=409.91999999999996s)]
*  Of the hostages who were originally taken, about 100 are still in Gaza, though a third [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=414.52s)]
*  are believed to be dead. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  A deal to return them and put a ceasefire in place has seemed imminent several times [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  over the last few months, only to fall apart. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=425.92s)]
*  In the latest talks, Israel demanded information from Hamas about which hostages are still [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=429.0s)]
*  alive, saying without that, there can be no deal. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=433.88s)]
*  And finally, in the days after Christmas, the town of Ghent in Belgium put a post on [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  its website offering residents a tip for an eco-friendly way to get rid of their Christmas [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=450.92s)]
*  trees. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=455.92s)]
*  Instead of just dragging them out to the curb, the city said people could turn their trees [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=457.16s)]
*  into a fragrant, festive snack. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  Delicious spruce needle butter was one suggestion, and they linked to a bunch of other spruce [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  recipes. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=469.96000000000004s)]
*  But the city's post prompted Belgian authorities to issue a clear, if unusual, warning. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=471.24s)]
*  Please do not eat your Christmas tree. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=476.44s)]
*  In a statement, authorities said the trees are often coated with pesticides and flame [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  retardants, a point the original post had acknowledged. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=483.32s)]
*  They also reminded any amateur spruce chefs that if they were to misidentify their tree, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  they could end up eating a yew tree, which is poisonous. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuwxfU9g4-o&t=492.26s)]
