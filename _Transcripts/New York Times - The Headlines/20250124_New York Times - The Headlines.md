# Trump’s First Presidential Trip, and an American Egg Crisis
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=4.88s)]
*  Today is Friday, January 24th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=8.44s)]
*  Today President Trump will make his first trip since returning to the White House, stopping [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=14.64s)]
*  in two states hit hard by natural disasters. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=19.28s)]
*  He'll start by flying to Asheville, North Carolina. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=22.44s)]
*  I'm going to stop because those people were treated very badly by Democrats. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  And I'm stopping there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  We're going to get that thing straightened out because they're still suffering from [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  a hurricane from months ago. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=34.16s)]
*  Trump has said the Republican-led state needs more help in the wake of devastating flooding [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=37.2s)]
*  triggered by Hurricane Helene this fall. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=41.92s)]
*  But he struck a different tone for his next stop, California, which is battling multiple [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=44.56s)]
*  wildfires. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=49.64s)]
*  I don't think we should give California anything until they let water flow down into there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=50.64s)]
*  From the north to the south. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=55.44s)]
*  This is a political thing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=56.44s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=57.44s)]
*  In an interview on Fox News, Trump threatened to withhold disaster aid from the Democratic-led [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=58.44s)]
*  state unless it changes its environmental policies around water management. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=63.4s)]
*  He's claimed the policies left firefighters with no water. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=68.56s)]
*  Experts say that's wrong. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=72.44s)]
*  Shortages were actually caused by maintenance issues and the sudden demand for water at [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=74.0s)]
*  so many hydrants all at once. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  California's Governor Gavin Newsom said he'll be waiting at the airport today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=81.08s)]
*  But Trump has not said whether he'll meet with him. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  To hear the judge from the bench say in his 40 years as a judge, he has never seen something [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=95.4s)]
*  so blatantly unconstitutional sets the tone for the seriousness of this effort. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=100.48s)]
*  On Thursday, a federal judge temporarily blocked President Trump's efforts to end automatic [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, calling it a clear violation [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=111.84s)]
*  of the Constitution. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  The attorneys general of more than 20 states had sued Trump over the executive order. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=119.04s)]
*  And outside the courthouse, the AG from Washington state celebrated the ruling. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=123.44s)]
*  And I think what the order today reinforces is that no one individual, not even the President [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=128.12s)]
*  of the United States, can simply erase what it means to amend the Constitution and the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=133.12s)]
*  process they're in. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=137.2s)]
*  Trump has promised to appeal the judge's decision, which was his first setback as he [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=138.72s)]
*  moves to overhaul the nation's immigration system. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=143.2s)]
*  And it's a preview of the many legal battles to come as he tries to implement his agenda. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=146.52s)]
*  He's already facing multiple other court challenges, including over his efforts to speed up deportations. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=151.48s)]
*  All this week, people have been buying and selling Trump and Melania. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=157.28s)]
*  Literally. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=169.68s)]
*  Just before Inauguration Day, Trump and his wife put their names on new crypto meme coins [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=170.76s)]
*  that investors can snap up. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=175.96s)]
*  They're a type of digital currency, usually based on a celebrity mascot or an internet [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=178.12s)]
*  joke. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=182.24s)]
*  And on paper, the Trumps have already made billions from them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=183.24s)]
*  These new meme coins, you know, one of the most aggressive forays by the Trump family [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=186.8s)]
*  into the crypto industry, are raising fresh ethics concerns. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=191.44s)]
*  My colleague David Yaffe-Bellany covers the crypto industry. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  He says that Trump and his family were already invested in the crypto market. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  But ethics experts he's talked to say the new tokens are possibly the most explicit [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=203.4s)]
*  profiteering effort ever by an incoming American president. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=208.28s)]
*  And they raise two major issues. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=212.4s)]
*  The first is that they present a new way for people who want to influence Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=214.6s)]
*  In the first term, you know, you could stay at a Trump branded hotel, and that would be [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=220.0s)]
*  kind of an indirect way to give money to the president to curry favor with him. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=223.84s)]
*  But now there's this super direct way to do it, to buy a meme coin that literally has [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=229.16s)]
*  Trump's name on it and from which he profits directly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=233.32s)]
*  The second ethical concern is related to regulation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=237.32s)]
*  After the Biden administration, the federal financial regulatory agencies launched a crackdown [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=241.3s)]
*  on the crypto industry. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=247.62s)]
*  They sued a bunch of crypto companies, they targeted fraudsters, and they argued that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=248.62s)]
*  crypto currencies should be regulated the same strict way that stocks and bonds get [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  regulated. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=258.5s)]
*  But now the Trump family has a direct financial interest in the cryptocurrency market. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=260.06s)]
*  But in theory, that could compromise the way that the White House regulates crypto. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=265.58s)]
*  Yesterday afternoon, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=274.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=276.06s)]
*  This is the crypto EO. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=277.06s)]
*  We're going to make America the world capital in crypto under your leadership. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=278.06s)]
*  Which is really going up, right? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=282.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=284.38s)]
*  Trump took the first step in laying out how his administration will handle cryptocurrency, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=285.38s)]
*  signing an executive order designed to boost the industry. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=290.38s)]
*  It's light on details, but it says crypto plays a, quote, crucial role in innovation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=293.82s)]
*  and economic development in the United States. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=299.38s)]
*  Morning, guys. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  I just want to show you the price of eggs in Los Angeles right now. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=311.21999999999997s)]
*  And these are not even the good eggs. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=314.34s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=316.1s)]
*  Shoppers across the country are facing soaring costs for eggs when they can even find them [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=317.9s)]
*  at all. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=322.78s)]
*  Oh, cage rate. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=324.73999999999995s)]
*  $13.99. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=325.73999999999995s)]
*  Some of that's because of inflation, but also because of a new wave of bird flu that's [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=327.46s)]
*  devastating the egg industry. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=331.78s)]
*  To try and stop the spread of the deadly virus, many farmers have had to kill off their chickens. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=334.17999999999995s)]
*  In the last three months, about 10% of America's egg-laying chickens have been wiped out, causing [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=339.84s)]
*  widespread shortages. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=345.2s)]
*  Some stores have had to put limits on how many eggs people can buy, and wholesale prices [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=347.61999999999995s)]
*  have surged to record highs. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=352.34s)]
*  Restaurants are paying around $7 for a dozen eggs. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=355.06s)]
*  That's up from just over $2 last fall. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=358.22s)]
*  Those prices are expected to keep climbing, potentially for months, until farms can replace [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=361.22s)]
*  the chickens they've lost. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=366.22s)]
*  And finally... [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=374.14s)]
*  You'll go crazy for kids' bodies. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=375.14s)]
*  Just 25 years ago, the Kids Bop franchise was born. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=380.34s)]
*  The compilations feature kids singing sanitized versions of the biggest pop songs of the day. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=386.62s)]
*  And the very G-rated albums are still coming. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=394.74s)]
*  The songs you know, the words are just a little different. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  Instead of Lady Gaga singing about sipping champagne, aka bub, the kids are eating grub. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=401.34s)]
*  And instead of Kesha getting a little tipsy... [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=407.5s)]
*  I did not realize how long Kids Bop had been around. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=415.5s)]
*  And that it's still thriving as the music industry has really shifted is really pretty [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  surprising. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=424.98s)]
*  Most acts can't say that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=426.3s)]
*  Most acts don't last this long. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=428.1s)]
*  To mark Kids Bop's 50th album, which just came out, my colleague So Pan Deb traced the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  company's trajectory. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=436.4s)]
*  He says the whole thing was the brainchild of two lawyers in the music industry who realized [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=437.56s)]
*  there was a hole in the market for kids who were too old for raffy and nursery rhymes, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=442.79999999999995s)]
*  but maybe not quite ready for top 40. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=447.94s)]
*  There was this niche to be filled of kid-friendly pop songs, because at the time, there was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  this increasing moral panic about the amount of sexualization and explicit lyrics in pop [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  songs. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=462.84s)]
*  So this was their answer. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=464.28s)]
*  So Pan says that over the years, the company managed to evolve. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=467.35999999999996s)]
*  Whether the crippling industry shift from CDs to streaming, it's now built out something [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  of a mini empire with a live touring act. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  And at almost a quarter century old, So Pan says it's even able to bank on nostalgia. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=481.44s)]
*  A lot of the parents who are now adults grew up listening to Kids Bop themselves. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrHgQm0n2M&t=486.91999999999996s)]
