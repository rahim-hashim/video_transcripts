# Trump Safe After ‘Attempted Assassination,’ and TikTok Heads to Court
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Monday, September 16th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=8.52s)]
*  The FBI says it's investigating what appears to be another assassination attempt against [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=14.08s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=18.6s)]
*  Trump was playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida yesterday afternoon when [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=20.16s)]
*  a Secret Service agent noticed the barrel of a rifle poking through the bushes along [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=24.060000000000002s)]
*  the fence line within shooting distance of the former president. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=28.56s)]
*  The agent opened fire, but the suspect was able to escape. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=32.6s)]
*  A witness who saw him leaving the bushes took a photo of his car, and he was later caught [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=36.16s)]
*  driving north on Interstate 95 and taken into custody. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=40.24s)]
*  It's not clear if he fired any shots while he was at the course. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump was not hurt. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=48.0s)]
*  A law enforcement official identified him to the Times as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=49.68s)]
*  The Times spoke with Routh last year. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=55.2s)]
*  He was actually previously interviewed for an article about Americans who were volunteering [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=58.0s)]
*  to aid the war effort in Ukraine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=62.64s)]
*  He had no military experience, but said he had traveled to Ukraine after Russia's invasion [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=65.2s)]
*  in 2022. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=70.24s)]
*  Patti Mazzei is the Times Miami bureau chief. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=72.24s)]
*  When Routh talked to the Times, he described himself as a, quote, U.S. citizen that's helping [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=75.2s)]
*  out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=80.56s)]
*  He had a plan to recruit Afghan soldiers to fight in Ukraine, which he seemed intent on, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=81.56s)]
*  even if there was no real way for him to pull that plan off. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=87.2s)]
*  Law enforcement said that yesterday when they arrested him, he was calm. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Investigators said they found an AK-47-style rifle with a scope near the property line [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=94.92s)]
*  of the golf course, along with two backpacks that were hung on the fence and a video camera, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  which suggested to law enforcement officials that the man might have intended to film a [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=107.72s)]
*  possible shooting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=112.88s)]
*  The fact that an armed man was able to get so close to the former president again will [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=114.48s)]
*  surely raise further scrutiny of the Secret Service, which is already facing a lot of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=120.88000000000001s)]
*  criticism from the assassination attempt earlier this summer. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=126.56s)]
*  President Biden said he's asked that the Secret Service get every resource necessary to ensure [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=133.32s)]
*  Trump's safety. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=138.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris echoed that, saying she was deeply disturbed by the incident. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=139.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump wrote in a fundraising email that, quote, My resolve is only stronger after [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=143.88s)]
*  another attempt on my life. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  In a federal courtroom in Washington, D.C. today, lawyers for TikTok will try and stop [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=157.44s)]
*  the government from banning the app, which is used by 170 million Americans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=162.52s)]
*  The app's been under scrutiny from lawmakers for years who've raised concerns that its [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=168.0s)]
*  connections to China pose a national security risk. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=172.68s)]
*  This spring, Congress passed a law forcing the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=176.56s)]
*  to either sell to a non-Chinese owner or face a nationwide ban. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=181.56s)]
*  TikTok says it's taken steps to address the concerns, like limiting how much user data [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  is sent to China, and it's arguing that a ban would violate constitutional protections [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  for free speech. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  This case has drawn a ton of interest across the board from constitutional law experts, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=199.2s)]
*  and they're viewing this as a landmark case for technology, for foreign policy, and for [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  First Amendment rights in the United States. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  Sapna Mahashwari covers TikTok for the Times. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=212.56s)]
*  The judges who will be hearing this case will be asking about the government's evidence [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=215.56s)]
*  for supporting this law. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  But they'll probably be asking TikTok about its structure and how the company is influenced [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=223.44s)]
*  by the Chinese government and by executives in China. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=229.8s)]
*  But regardless of how the three judges in this case rule, all of the legal experts I [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  spoken with expect this to go to the Supreme Court. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=239.76s)]
*  TikTok's role in American culture and American life is tremendous. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=243.56s)]
*  And it's remarkable that this law is really threatening the future of this app in the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=249.32s)]
*  United States as soon as January. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that's something that a lot of TikTok users probably can't fully wrap their heads [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=256.0s)]
*  around. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=260.8s)]
*  And it says a lot about where our country is in terms of its relationship with China, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=262.0s)]
*  our use of social media, and how we're viewing the First Amendment in the digital age. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=267.08s)]
*  Flooding caused by heavy rains has devastated cities and towns across West and Central Africa [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=279.64s)]
*  in the last few days, leaving more than a thousand people dead and forcing nearly one [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  million people to flee their homes, according to humanitarian agencies. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=290.52s)]
*  Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Mali have all reported deadly flooding. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=295.24s)]
*  It's really an additional burden to already existing crises. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=299.08s)]
*  This region has been facing a conflict for a decade. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=304.44s)]
*  And more recently, we have seen food inflation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=309.52s)]
*  Food prices have been skyrocketing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=312.52s)]
*  An official from the UN's World Food Program, who flew over the flooded area in Nigeria, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=316.52s)]
*  said he'd seen houses, schools and hospitals submerged. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=321.44s)]
*  The bodies of humans and animals have been seen floating in the floodwaters. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=325.12s)]
*  Even more extreme flooding is forecast for later this year. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=329.72s)]
*  Experts show climate change is making flooding worse in some parts of Africa. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=333.92s)]
*  Experts say that overall, people on the continent are experiencing a disproportionate burden [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=338.92s)]
*  from climate change. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=343.04s)]
*  The continent produces only a fraction of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, and his inner circle are in crisis as four separate [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=356.68s)]
*  federal investigations have now reached the highest levels of city government. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=362.20000000000005s)]
*  Prosecutors have been tight-lipped about their cases, but there's one investigation into [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  whether his election campaign conspired to get illegal foreign donations, another one [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=370.92s)]
*  into a possible bribery scheme involving a consulting company, and also what appears [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=375.68s)]
*  to be an investigation focused on a nightclub security business owned by the former police [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  commissioner's twin brother. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  The swirl of legal troubles has destabilized the administration. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=386.86s)]
*  On Thursday, the police commissioner resigned under pressure, and two days later the mayor's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=390.72s)]
*  chief counsel abruptly quit. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=395.0s)]
*  One person familiar with her thinking told the Times it's because Adams wasn't following [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=397.72s)]
*  her advice on personnel matters. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=401.94000000000005s)]
*  Adams himself hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing, though last fall FBI agents seized [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=405.12s)]
*  his phones and his iPad. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=410.0s)]
*  He says he's done nothing wrong and that he's focused on serving New Yorkers. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=412.36s)]
*  Still the scope of the investigations into City Hall is unprecedented in New York City's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  modern history. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=421.68s)]
*  Two state lawmakers have called on Adams to resign, and he's facing a hotly contested [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=423.44s)]
*  primary election next year. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  And finally... [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=438.04s)]
*  Welcome everybody to the 76th Emmy Awards. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=439.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  Also known as Broadcast TV's biggest night for honoring movie stars on streaming services. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=445.52s)]
*  The Emmy Awards were handed out last night in Los Angeles, with father and son Eugene [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  and Dan Levy, Schitt's Creek fame, hosting the show. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=456.56s)]
*  If it goes well tonight, my name is pronounced Levy, not Levy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  And if things go south, my name is pronounced Martin Short. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  Hanging over the Emmys was the reality that the TV industry's been contracting. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=469.08s)]
*  Networks and streamers have been slashing projects. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=474.2s)]
*  The number of shows submitted this year in the drama and comedy categories plummeted. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=477.24s)]
*  Other categories didn't even have a full slate of nominees. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=482.24s)]
*  Still, there was the red carpet and the glitz and the glam, and a new record holder for [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=485.52s)]
*  most Emmy Awards for a single season. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=491.02s)]
*  The Emmy goes to... [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  Shogun. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=497.08s)]
*  The Japanese historical epic Shogun has now rigged in a total 18 Emmys, including for [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=500.16s)]
*  best drama. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=505.92s)]
*  It's a major breakthrough for a foreign language series, 70% of the shows in Japanese. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=507.48s)]
*  The show's co-creator, Justin Marks, thanked the studios for taking the risk. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=513.52s)]
*  You guys greenlit a very expensive, subtitled Japanese period piece whose central climax [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I80cYCKG7s&t=517.6800000000001s)]
