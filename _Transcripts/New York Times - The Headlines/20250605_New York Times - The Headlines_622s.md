# Trump Orders a Travel Ban, Investigation of Biden; Genome Testing for Newborn Babies | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Thursday, June 5th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=7.84s)]
*  Today I am signing a new executive order placing travel restrictions on countries including [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Yemen, Somalia, Haiti, Libya, and numerous others. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=21.76s)]
*  President Trump has revived a controversial policy from his first term, a travel ban. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=27.68s)]
*  It will go into effect Monday and prohibit citizens from 12 countries, mainly in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=33.16s)]
*  Middle East and Africa, from entering the U.S. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=37.96s)]
*  It also limits travel from seven other countries. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=40.96s)]
*  The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=43.86s)]
*  to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=49.36s)]
*  who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=55.82s)]
*  We don't want them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=60.220000000000006s)]
*  In a speech announcing the plan, the president linked it to Sunday's attack in Boulder, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=61.580000000000005s)]
*  in which a man from Egypt was arrested and charged with a hate crime for allegedly throwing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=65.98s)]
*  Molotov cocktails at a group that was honoring Israeli hostages. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=70.60000000000001s)]
*  Egypt is not currently on the list of banned countries, but Trump said new ones could be [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  added. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=79.42s)]
*  And nothing will stop us from keeping America safe. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=80.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=84.66s)]
*  This marks yet another moment in President Trump's crackdown on immigration. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=86.02s)]
*  My colleague Hamid El-Aziz covers immigration. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=91.08s)]
*  He says Trump's first travel ban in 2017, which blocked travel from several majority [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=93.86s)]
*  Muslim countries, kicked off mass protests, chaos at airports, and several legal battles. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  Critics called it discriminatory, though the Supreme Court ultimately permitted a rewritten [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  version of it to take effect. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=111.56s)]
*  Several experts think this new ban may hold up to any challenges in light of that ruling. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=113.82s)]
*  This ban has some important exceptions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=119.22s)]
*  There are people who are not going to be affected by this ban, and those people include green [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=122.41999999999999s)]
*  card holders, dual nationals, people who are seeking visas through U.S. citizen family [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=128.32s)]
*  that they have, including spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=134.85999999999999s)]
*  They will be exempted from this ban. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=140.1s)]
*  Hamid says the Trump administration also put in a specific exemption for athletes who are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=144.98s)]
*  coming to compete in the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics, both of which will be held [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=149.42s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=155.18s)]
*  In another major move yesterday, President Trump ordered his White House counsel to investigate [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=162.18s)]
*  Joe Biden and his staff to see whether Biden's actions while in office, like pardons and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  proclamations, were legally valid. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=173.14s)]
*  The order is Trump's latest attempt to stoke conspiracy theories about his predecessor, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=176.26s)]
*  in this case that Biden was mentally incapacitated and that his aides were enacting policies [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=181.5s)]
*  without his knowledge. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=186.66s)]
*  Over the weekend, Trump shared a social media post claiming that at one point, Biden was [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=188.38s)]
*  replaced with a robotic clone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  He's also called out Biden's use of the auto pen system, which reproduces a person's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=196.14s)]
*  signature for official documents. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=201.1s)]
*  Trump's new order argues that using the auto pen could affect the validity of anything [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=203.5s)]
*  that was signed with it, though Trump has acknowledged his administration uses it too. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  Biden put out a statement in response to the order, calling the accusations ridiculous [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=212.98s)]
*  and false and saying, let me be clear, I made the decisions during my presidency. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  At the United Nations yesterday. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=227.14s)]
*  The result of the voting is as follows. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  14 votes in favor, one vote against, zero abstention. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=233.26s)]
*  The U.S. was the only country on the Security Council to veto a resolution demanding an [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=238.77999999999997s)]
*  immediate ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=243.54s)]
*  The measure called for a stop to the fighting, the release of all hostages, and the resumption [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=246.1s)]
*  of full-scale humanitarian aid in the territory. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=251.06s)]
*  The acting U.S. ambassador to the U.N. called the resolution a non-starter. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=254.52s)]
*  The United States has been clear. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  We would not support any measure that fails to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=261.68s)]
*  to disarm and leave Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  The vote underscored how the U.S. continues to support Israel unconditionally. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  This is now the fourth ceasefire measure it's vetoed since the war began, leading many other [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=274.92s)]
*  countries to voice frustrations both in public and in private about America's stance. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=279.52s)]
*  As a permanent member of the Security Council, the U.S. can block any measures with just [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=284.84s)]
*  a single vote. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=288.91999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, the new U.S.-Israeli-backed effort to distribute a limited amount of aid in Gaza [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  was suspended yesterday after a week of chaos and deadly violence. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  On two occasions, Israeli soldiers opened fire while groups of Palestinians approached [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=303.64s)]
*  one of the new sites. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=308.16s)]
*  The Israeli military said it fired warning shots at, quote, suspects who had approached [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=313.72s)]
*  The Gaza Health Ministry reported that more than 47 people were killed in the two incidents, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  many of them children. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  The sites are supposed to reopen today, and the organization running them, the Gaza Humanitarian [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  Foundation, now has a new leader. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=326.0s)]
*  Johnny Moore, a public relations executive who used to attend prayer meetings with Trump [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=328.44000000000005s)]
*  in the Oval Office, was appointed chairman after the last leader quit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=332.64s)]
*  These days, nearly every baby born in the U.S. undergoes the same ritual at the hospital [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=348.64s)]
*  when they're just a day old. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=353.36s)]
*  A nurse pricks their heel, and tiny drops of blood are sent off for a standard screening [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=355.16s)]
*  panel. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=360.2s)]
*  The baby checks for biomarkers that may indicate rare but treatable diseases like sickle cell [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=361.2s)]
*  anemia or cystic fibrosis. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=365.44s)]
*  But what if that same test could reveal a baby's chance of developing certain conditions [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=367.88s)]
*  later in life? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  What if it could tell parents their child is likely to be diagnosed with autism, or [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=374.52s)]
*  that they're likely to develop certain cancers as an adult? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=378.28s)]
*  As genetic testing becomes cheaper and easier to do, those scenarios are no longer hypothetical, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=381.68s)]
*  and the advancements have kicked off an ethical debate. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=388.16s)]
*  Experts have different opinions about where to draw the line, what types of conditions [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=391.48s)]
*  should we sequence for, should we look at every condition we possibly can, or should [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=395.68s)]
*  we really limit it to some specific ones? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  Emily Baumgartner-Nunn covers health at The Times. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=403.20000000000005s)]
*  People who are very supportive of widespread genome sequencing for a vast array of genes, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=406.36s)]
*  Basically their position is that knowledge is power. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=412.72s)]
*  And proponents of this, specifically bioethicists and geneticists, they believe that parents [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=417.32000000000005s)]
*  can handle this kind of information, even incomplete information, predictive information [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=422.12s)]
*  that may not come to pass. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=426.88000000000005s)]
*  They believe that we should be equipping families and giving them the ability to act upon this [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=429.04s)]
*  information if they want to. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=433.16s)]
*  But there are just as many experts in these fields who really encourage caution in how [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=435.16s)]
*  we apply this technology. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=441.2s)]
*  For example, some researchers believe it's completely out of the question that we should [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=443.42s)]
*  ever reveal an adult onset condition in a child. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=447.78s)]
*  For example, genes that code for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, some conditions like those. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=452.03999999999996s)]
*  Other researchers feel very strongly about testing only for conditions that are treatable [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=457.24s)]
*  and that are treatable right now. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=463.84s)]
*  They believe that if we don't have a medication that can essentially cure the condition, we [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  shouldn't be testing for it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=469.64s)]
*  We shouldn't be bombarding parents with really despairing predictions for conditions that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=470.88s)]
*  if their child has it, there's nothing they're going to be able to do about it anyway. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=476.78s)]
*  Emily says that there's one thing people on all sides of the issue agree on, and that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=482.68s)]
*  is that the technology is coming and fast, which is forcing the conversation. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=487.4s)]
*  Tens of thousands of American parents have already enrolled in research projects that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=492.88s)]
*  their infant's genome. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=497.88s)]
*  And finally, birds should not be underestimated. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=508.8s)]
*  Magpies can remember up to 30 different human faces. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC-h8EYvLYA&t=513.24s)]
