# An Economic Warning, and a Deal With Ukraine
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, May [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=0.0s)]
*  1st. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=7.2s)]
*  This is Biden's economy because we took over on January 20th. And I think you have to get [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=13.76s)]
*  us a little bit of time to get moving. But this is the Biden economy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=19.52s)]
*  President Trump is on defense after new data from the Commerce Department showed the U.S. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=25.6s)]
*  economy shrank in the first three months of this year as his economic and trade policies [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=29.96s)]
*  rattled consumers and businesses. There are some quirks to how the data is measured, but [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=35.04s)]
*  overall the new figures show a reversal from the strong growth the quarter before. And [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  they don't even offer a full picture of the disruption, since the data only runs through [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=44.72s)]
*  March before most of Trump's tariffs took effect. After the numbers came out yesterday, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=48.96s)]
*  stocks dropped, continuing a rocky trend on Wall Street. Looking at the S&P 500, it's now had the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=54.32s)]
*  worst performance for the start of any president's term in more than 50 years. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=60.68s)]
*  The president loves to talk about how this isn't his economy. It's an economy inherited [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=66.08s)]
*  from President Biden. But to the extent that there is a slowdown looming on the horizon, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=71.36s)]
*  most of that is about the president's policies. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=78.32s)]
*  John Castleman covers the economy for The Times. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=82.44s)]
*  If we see higher prices because of tariffs, if we see slower growth because of tariffs, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=85.16s)]
*  if we see higher unemployment, you know, that is really a direct result of President Trump's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  policies. I had an economist say to me this week that if we get a recession, it will be [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  a voluntary recession, a recession that functionally the president chose to cause. And that's a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=101.0s)]
*  pretty remarkable place for the economy to be. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=107.32s)]
*  The president so far has seemed to dismiss rising concerns that his trade war could be [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=112.6s)]
*  hard on Americans, even as business owners have tried to raise the alarm. Toy stores, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  for example, have already said they're worried about empty shelves at Christmas as it gets too [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=123.24s)]
*  expensive to bring in any more inventory. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=128.52s)]
*  instead of 30 dolls, you know, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=133.16s)]
*  would normally. But we're not talking about something that we have to go out of our way. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=138.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill yesterday, the joint resolution fails passage, a bipartisan attempt [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=145.4s)]
*  to try and undo Trump's global tariffs died in the Senate. Trump's been able to roll out [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=153.56s)]
*  the tariffs because he declared a national emergency, which gives presidents the power [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=159.08s)]
*  to single handedly impose levies. Three Republicans joined with Democrats to try and end that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=163.4s)]
*  emergency declaration. And the count was close enough that ultimately Vice President J.D. Vance [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=168.76s)]
*  had to go to the Capitol to cast the deciding vote to kill the measure. Even if it had passed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  the Senate, it had no chance of getting through the House or the White House, which could veto it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=179.56s)]
*  But Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said, quote, The United States Senate cannot be an [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=184.28s)]
*  idle spectator in the terror of madness. After months of talks and one televised shouting match [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=189.72s)]
*  in the Oval Office, the Trump administration has announced it's reached a deal with Ukraine [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=203.8s)]
*  to share revenues from the country's mineral reserves. Ukraine's president, Vladimir Zelensky, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=208.92s)]
*  first proposed the plan last year as a way of keeping the U.S. invested in his country's future. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=214.36s)]
*  President Trump had been complaining that the U.S. should get something in return for the billions [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  it spent supporting Ukraine's war effort. A version of the deal was supposed to be signed [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  in February, but when Zelensky went to the White House to finalize it, Trump berated him for not [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=228.76s)]
*  showing enough gratitude, and Zelensky was asked to leave. Now details of the new agreement are [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=234.11999999999998s)]
*  being worked out, but the biggest question is whether it will include any guarantee that the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=240.2s)]
*  U.S. will continue to support Ukraine. Critics of the deal say that without that explicit promise, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=245.16s)]
*  the U.S. is basically just taking advantage of a country under attack. Still, some of Ukraine's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=251.56s)]
*  allies celebrated the signing, saying it shows that Zelensky and Trump are able to work together. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=257.56s)]
*  In Vermont yesterday, a federal judge ordered the release of a Columbia University student [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=266.52s)]
*  who the Trump administration has been trying to deport. The case isn't over, but Mohsen [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=271.56s)]
*  Madawi is now out on bail. He spoke to a crowd of supporters as he left the courthouse. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=276.6s)]
*  And I am saying it clear and loud. Yes. To President Trump and his cabinet. Yes. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  I am not afraid of you. Madawi was a prominent organizer of the protests on Columbia's campus [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  against the war in Gaza. He grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=298.28s)]
*  and is a permanent legal resident of the U.S. Last month, the government detained him as part [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=303.08s)]
*  of a crackdown on student protesters and accused him of promoting anti-Semitism, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=308.28s)]
*  the same justification they're using to try and deport Mahmoud Khalil, who was also involved in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=313.32s)]
*  the Columbia protests. In granting him bail, the judge overseeing Madawi's case called the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=317.71999999999997s)]
*  government's attempt to strip him of his green card, chilling, and said he received more than [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=323.0s)]
*  90 submissions from community members, many of them Jewish, attesting to his character. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=327.88s)]
*  His lawyer says he'll continue studying at Columbia as his case works its way through the courts. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=333.48s)]
*  Pakistan says it expects India to launch a military strike on the country any day now, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=349.08s)]
*  as tensions continue to escalate after a deadly terrorist attack. Last week, militants opened fire [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=354.6s)]
*  at a popular mountain getaway in the border region of Kashmir, killing 26 people. India has accused [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  Pakistan of supporting the attack, an accusation Pakistan denies. These two countries, both nuclear [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  armed, have been in sort of a state of managed hostilities for a long time, for decades. My [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=373.24s)]
*  colleague, Mujeeb Mashal, is based in New Delhi. Every now and then, there's a spark, there's a [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=379.4s)]
*  military confrontation, and every time the stakes go higher. On the one hand, people move on about [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=384.28s)]
*  their lives thinking, okay, this has been the nature of this relationship for decades. They just [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=390.03999999999996s)]
*  manage to live with each other in sort of this managed hostility. On the other hand, it's every [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  single time of it is a reminder of how volatile this dynamic is between two nuclear armed neighbors [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=400.44s)]
*  who continue to engage every few years in military confrontation, where nobody knows how far that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=408.36s)]
*  confrontation can go. Mujeeb says that beyond the threat of war with Pakistan, the militant attack [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=414.68s)]
*  has also raised concerns about a religious crackdown inside India. The attack happened in a Muslim [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=422.36s)]
*  majority region, and nearly all the victims were Hindus. Now, he says, some hard-right Hindu [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  nationalists in India have been intensifying their harassment of Muslims, with reports of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=434.2s)]
*  several Muslims being killed and thousands detained. And finally. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=439.4s)]
*  We're so excited to be able to release the information that Valerie has been secured. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=453.88s)]
*  She's safe and sound after what was a rollercoaster ride. After 529 days lost in the wild, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=458.91999999999996s)]
*  Valerie the dachshund has been rescued. The little dog slipped out of her pen and into the bush on [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  Australia's Kangaroo Island over a year and a half ago when her owners were visiting. It set off a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=472.76s)]
*  frenzied search. The odds did not seem good. According to her owners, she was, quote, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=478.36s)]
*  not a very outside rough and tough dog. There were occasional sightings of Valerie in her little pink [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=484.04s)]
*  collar, but she ran when anyone got close. The rescue group that ultimately helped recover [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=490.04s)]
*  Valerie said it was a long process. Once they got a sense of where she was, they had to set a trap [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=495.48s)]
*  with her favorite food and pieces of a t-shirt from her owner and just wait. Valerie's a little [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=500.6s)]
*  thinner now with a few scars and there's more to be done before she can really go home. She's got [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=506.92s)]
*  lost dog syndrome. Basically, she spent so long in survival mode, she's got to get used to people [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=512.36s)]
*  again. The rescue group said they hope to get her back to her owners next week. For anyone surprised [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  that a dachshund made it through the wilderness, perhaps because you've seen them be pushed around [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  in baby carriages wearing sweaters, you should know that the American Kennel Club says the breed [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=528.04s)]
*  has some real survival skills and can be, quote, brave to the point of rashness. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EaNtY8pShU&t=541.8000000000001s)]
