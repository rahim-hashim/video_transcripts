# A Search for Syria’s Disappeared, and New Details in C.E.O. Killing Investigation
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=4.4s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, December 11th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=5.4s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=7.44s)]
*  In Syria, the end of Bashar al-Assad's regime has kicked off a desperate search. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=13.96s)]
*  Families are hoping to find out what happened to their loved ones who disappeared while [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=19.36s)]
*  Assad was in power. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=23.2s)]
*  For years, Assad used mass arrests, imprisonment, and torture to crush dissent. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=25.24s)]
*  People were pulled off the streets or out of classrooms and never came home. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=31.0s)]
*  The whereabouts of more than 130,000 Syrians who were arrested is still unknown, according [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=35.26s)]
*  to a human rights group there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=41.08s)]
*  After Assad fled Syria on Sunday, people rushed to one of the country's most notorious prisons, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  a mountaintop complex called Sadnaya, to look for their relatives. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=49.16s)]
*  Reports spread that there might be hidden underground cells, and they used shovels and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=53.8s)]
*  excavators to tear up the floors and the walls in a frantic search. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=58.04s)]
*  They didn't end up finding any secret rooms, but dozens of bodies were recovered at the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=62.44s)]
*  complex. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=67.56s)]
*  Yesterday, Times reporters were at a morgue in Damascus where they were taken. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=68.56s)]
*  Medical workers had started a social media channel where they were posting photos of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=74.0s)]
*  the dead so they could be ID'd, and hundreds of people flooded into the building, tearing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=77.8s)]
*  off tarps that covered the bodies to see who was underneath. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=82.44s)]
*  Some of the bodies seemed to have signs of torture. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=86.56s)]
*  Many of the faces were so gaunt that family members wondered aloud if they'd even be [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=89.84s)]
*  able to recognize them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=94.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, the rebel alliance that's taken control of Syria has vowed to hunt down and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=97.84s)]
*  punish senior members of the Assad regime who they say were responsible for torture [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=109.28s)]
*  and other abuses. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=114.16s)]
*  They're working to consolidate power, even as other groups and neighboring countries [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=115.56s)]
*  are fighting for territory and control amid the chaos and uncertainty. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=121.52s)]
*  The Israeli military says it's launched at least 350 airstrikes on Syria, taking out [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=126.32s)]
*  the country's entire navy and destroying fighter jets and air defense systems, saying [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=132.64s)]
*  they want to keep those weapons out of the hands of Islamist extremists. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  And in the north of Syria yesterday, there was intense fighting between another faction [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=142.44s)]
*  of rebels, supported by Turkey, and Kurdish forces backed by the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=146.48s)]
*  The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO appeared in court in Pennsylvania yesterday [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=163.24s)]
*  for an extradition hearing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  Prosecutors in New York have charged Luigi Mangione with murder and want him brought [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=171.08s)]
*  to the state, but Mangione is fighting that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=175.08s)]
*  That could keep him in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested, for weeks of legal back and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=178.44s)]
*  forth. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  Listen, I haven't seen any evidence that says that he's the shooter. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  And remember, and this is not just a small thing, the fundamental concept of American [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  justice is the presumption of innocent and until you're proven guilty beyond reasonable [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=192.28s)]
*  doubt. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=195.92s)]
*  Mangione's lawyer spoke to reporters after the hearing, but waved off most questions. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=196.92s)]
*  How do you end up in Altoona? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=201.52s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=202.52s)]
*  Has he been able to contact his family since? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=203.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going to get into that either. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=206.52s)]
*  On the investigation front, the Times has obtained a copy of an internal NYPD report [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=209.72s)]
*  that details parts of the manifesto Mangione was found with when he was arrested. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=214.96s)]
*  Police say Mangione described the health insurance industry as parasitic and said Mangione, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=219.92s)]
*  quote, likely views himself as a hero of sorts who has finally decided to act upon such injustices. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=225.48s)]
*  On social media, some people have echoed that idea, even celebrating Mangione as a vigilante, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=232.76s)]
*  someone they think was fighting back against the for-profit health care system. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  Mangione's lawyer told CNN people have been reaching out to support him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  I have received some emails. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=248.04s)]
*  I have not seen them personally, but my understanding from my staff is people are doing that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=249.48s)]
*  The people are reaching out to you and offering to help pay for his legal bills. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=255.44s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=260.08s)]
*  The biggest potential grocery store merger in U.S. history just took a double hit. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=269.36s)]
*  Groger has been trying to acquire its rival chain Albertsons for $25 billion, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=275.16s)]
*  but both a federal judge and a Washington state judge moved to block the deal yesterday, one after the other. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=281.36s)]
*  It's a win for federal regulators, who've argued that the merger could cut down on competition, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=288.04s)]
*  hurting customers who might have fewer options. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  They also argued it would hurt grocery store workers, who could see their wages fall. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=296.36s)]
*  The companies, for their part, have argued they need to merge in order to compete against the likes of Walmart and Amazon. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=301.16s)]
*  Combining forces would give them some 5,000 stores across 48 states. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=308.16s)]
*  And that still might happen. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=313.56s)]
*  Yesterday's rulings have only paused the merger. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=315.96s)]
*  The Federal Trade Commission will ultimately decide if it can go through. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  The current head of the FTC, Lena Kahn, has aggressively challenged high-profile mergers, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  but the supermarket giants could get more friendly treatment soon. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=328.48s)]
*  President-elect Trump just named his pick to lead the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=332.36s)]
*  who's promised to ease up on policing these kinds of deals. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=337.36s)]
*  This is Mark Abramson, photographer of the New York Times, currently on top of the hill, overlooking the Pacific coast, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=340.84s)]
*  and seeing a fire that is burning. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=347.84s)]
*  In Southern California, the fire is still burning. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=352.84s)]
*  The fire is still burning. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=356.84s)]
*  The fire is still burning. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=358.84s)]
*  The fire is still burning. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=360.84s)]
*  The fire is still burning. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=362.84s)]
*  The fire is still burning. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=364.84s)]
*  The fire is still burning. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=366.84s)]
*  In Southern California, the Times is tracking the Franklin Fire, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=369.84s)]
*  which has scorched more than 2,700 acres near Malibu since it started on Monday night. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=373.84s)]
*  I have my N95 mask just to protect a little bit from all the smoke. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=378.84s)]
*  You can hear helicopters overhead. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=384.84s)]
*  That's an LA County fire about to drop water, signaling to crews nearby. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=387.84s)]
*  Hundreds of firefighters have been working to put out the flames, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=393.84s)]
*  and some residents who ignored evacuation orders used garden hoses to try and save their homes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=397.84s)]
*  The fire started in the dry, scrub-filled canyons above Malibu and has been fueled by intense winds. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=402.84s)]
*  As of early this morning, it was 0% contained, and a long stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway has been shut down. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=409.84s)]
*  Officials are hoping that as the wind lets up today, they'll be able to get control of the blaze. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=417.84s)]
*  And finally, today, FIFA is set to announce the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=428.84s)]
*  In a first for the soccer championship, 2030 is expected to be held across a group of countries [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=436.84s)]
*  spread across three continents—Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=442.84s)]
*  The pick for 2034, though, Saudi Arabia, is already stirring up controversy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=449.84s)]
*  One of the biggest concerns is over the people who will build the Saudi Arabia World Cup in 2034. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=455.84s)]
*  The majority of stadiums are unbuilt airports, roads, in fact, an entire new city is expected to be built. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=461.84s)]
*  Much of that work will be done by thousands, if not millions, of migrant workers from some of the poorest countries on the planet. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=467.84s)]
*  My colleague Tarek Panja is covering the host city selection process. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=473.84s)]
*  There were similar concerns around the 2022 World Cup, which was held in neighboring Qatar. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=477.84s)]
*  Rights groups have said as many as thousands of workers were killed in the build-up to that World Cup, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=483.84s)]
*  where a dozen new stadiums were built, roads, and other infrastructure, similar to projects that are required in Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=488.84s)]
*  There are also broader human rights concerns about Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=495.84s)]
*  He's been praised in some parts of the world for reforms, liberalizations to Saudi society. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=502.84s)]
*  But rights groups say that there are major concerns about the treatment of women, the fate of the LGBTQ community, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=509.84s)]
*  as well as anyone who opposes the regime. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=518.8399999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's response to these concerns has been to call much of the dialogue shallow, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=522.8399999999999s)]
*  and instead said the country is on the path towards change, and events like the World Cup will only move those changes forward. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=530.8399999999999s)]
*  But obviously once Saudi Arabia is awarded the World Cup, the biggest sporting event on the planet, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=538.84s)]
*  that will bring more scrutiny than it has likely faced before, both from the media and activist groups. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=544.84s)]
*  Scrutiny that will last at least a decade now for Saudi Arabia. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=550.84s)]
*  For more about the World Cup selection process, and how FIFA bent its own rules to choose Saudi Arabia, go to nytimes.com. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=554.84s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=565.84s)]
*  Today on The Daily, The Times' chief architecture critic tells the story of the remarkable reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=568.84s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iatRhpsXjsc&t=576.84s)]
