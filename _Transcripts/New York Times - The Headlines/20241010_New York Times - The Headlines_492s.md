# Milton’s Path of Destruction, and a First Biden-Netanyahu Call in Months
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Thursday, October 10. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=8.68s)]
*  Yeah, Dennis, we have some unbelievable, something unbelievable to show you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=11.68s)]
*  This is Tropicana Field. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=18.88s)]
*  The roof, a big portion of it has ripped off. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=20.86s)]
*  Hurricane Milton slammed into Florida last night as a Category 3 just south of Sarasota. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=25.2s)]
*  Its high winds battered the Tampa Bay area, even ripping the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=30.8s)]
*  Stadium, which was captured by the local ABC station. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=36.16s)]
*  This is the power of Hurricane Milton. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=40.04s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=43.08s)]
*  The building was being used to house emergency workers there to help clean up after the storm. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=44.36s)]
*  Milton also brought relentless rain to the area, with 10 to 14 inches falling just in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=50.36s)]
*  the early part of the night. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=55.08s)]
*  Within an hour of Milton coming ashore, almost a million people had lost power. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=57.08s)]
*  That number doubled to 2 million by midnight. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=61.76s)]
*  It's now at 3 million. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=63.72s)]
*  The hurricane also spawned powerful tornadoes across the state, and search and rescue efforts [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=66.32s)]
*  are underway this morning through the wreckage. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  According to police, multiple people were killed at a retirement community in Fort Pierce [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=74.52s)]
*  when a tornado tore through it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=79.72s)]
*  Even after the storm moves over Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean, it's going to continue [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  to lash the state's east coast with wind and rain that could cause widespread flooding [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=88.72s)]
*  from the storm surge. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Hurricane Milton could exacerbate an already critical shortage of IV fluids [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=96.72s)]
*  that has hospitals nationwide scrambling. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=104.56s)]
*  The fluids are essential for vulnerable patients from premature babies to people doing in-home [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=107.96s)]
*  dialysis to those in intensive care. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  And the plant that makes more than half of the U.S. supply of IV fluids was damaged by [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  Hurricane Helene and closed temporarily. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=121.28s)]
*  Now a plant in Daytona, Florida, which makes a quarter of the same supply, also finds itself [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=124.63999999999999s)]
*  in the path of extreme weather. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  Workers there were loading up trucks with the supplies to get them somewhere safer earlier [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=132.56s)]
*  this week. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=136.0s)]
*  Together, that's 85 percent of the country's IV fluid production under threat from hurricanes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=137.4s)]
*  Hospitals have been rationing the fluids, and U.S. officials just approved an airlift [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=144.4s)]
*  of supplies from overseas to try and help. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=148.8s)]
*  President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone yesterday [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=159.96s)]
*  about how Israel will respond to Iran's missile attack. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=165.08s)]
*  David Sanger, who covers national security for the Times, says it was the first time [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=169.0s)]
*  the world leaders have spoken in two months. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=173.4s)]
*  What loomed over the conversation on Wednesday was one of the worst relationships between [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=176.8s)]
*  Israel and the United States in modern times. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=183.44s)]
*  One of the deepest frustrations you've heard from administration officials is that the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=188.16s)]
*  Israeli's have not only ignored the president's advice, they haven't even given a heads up [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=192.96s)]
*  to the United States about some of the biggest attacks. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=198.16s)]
*  David says it's not clear if this phone call went any better than previous talks between [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=201.4s)]
*  the two, after which Biden's been known to hang up the phone and mutter a string of epithets [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=206.08s)]
*  about Netanyahu. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  At the moment, the U.S. has been urging Israel to avoid hitting Iran's nuclear or energy [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  sites, which could escalate the conflict and lead to more retaliation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=217.96s)]
*  It's not clear if Israel will heed that advice. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=222.84s)]
*  It's also not clear when Israel will act. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=225.84s)]
*  David says that may be the point. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=228.84s)]
*  The Israelis now realize in a way they didn't six months ago when there was a previous set [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=231.44s)]
*  of attacks, that they can take their time. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=236.08s)]
*  That it actually kind of tortures the Iranian government to let them dangle wondering when [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=240.0s)]
*  the retaliation's going to come. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=245.68s)]
*  A new poll from the Times and Siena College shows Republicans are on track to take control [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=252.84s)]
*  of the Senate. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=263.08s)]
*  The Senate's been narrowly held by Democrats, 51 to 49, but Joe Manchin retiring in West [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=264.72s)]
*  Virginia means Republicans will almost certainly pick up a seat there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=270.4s)]
*  And now the latest numbers out of Montana show how they'll likely gain another one. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=274.6s)]
*  Democratic Senator John Tester is trailing his Republican challenger Tim Sheehy there [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=280.32s)]
*  by seven points. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=284.88s)]
*  Tester has strong support from moderates and independent voters, but is struggling to overcome [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=287.24s)]
*  the state's conservative tilt. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=291.8s)]
*  Facing that math, Democrats are hoping to flip a seat somewhere else, though it will [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=294.92s)]
*  be an uphill battle. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=299.76s)]
*  Today's poll shows that the best chance to do that could be in Texas, where Republican [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=301.88s)]
*  Ted Cruz is running for his third term. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=306.32s)]
*  His Democratic challenger Colin Allred is closing in on him, trailing by just four points. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=309.64s)]
*  Flipping a seat in the deep red state of Texas has been a longtime dream of Democrats, though [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=315.64s)]
*  they've fallen far short of that in recent elections. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=320.36s)]
*  And finally. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=330.08s)]
*  My name is Frances Robles. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=331.08s)]
*  I'm a correspondent for the New York Times. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=333.44s)]
*  I'm in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=335.74s)]
*  I'm about to go out with the Kenyan police forces who are here in Haiti trying to take [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  back the city. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  Times reporter Frances Robles just got back from Haiti, where she embedded with Kenyan [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=346.11999999999995s)]
*  police forces who deployed to the country earlier this summer to try and fight rampant [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=350.52s)]
*  gang violence there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=355.0s)]
*  The gangs have terrorized Haiti. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=356.96s)]
*  Murders, kidnapping and rape have been widespread. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=359.11999999999995s)]
*  Frances and the officers from Kenya drove through the country's capital, much of which [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=363.0s)]
*  has been under gang control. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=367.02s)]
*  We saw entire neighborhoods that were completely desolate with burnt out cars, shot out buildings. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  It looked like war, to be honest. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=377.94s)]
*  And as we were heading out of the really deserted area, we saw the most frightening thing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=381.14s)]
*  Someone had propped up a skull on a stick in the middle of the street. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  And it was a really menacing sign from the gangs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  I took it as to the Kenyan police and to the military and to the Haitian police. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=395.7s)]
*  We rule these streets. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  Frances says that the chaos has spread far beyond Port-au-Prince. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=402.9s)]
*  More than 700,000 people have fled their homes, many of them landing in squalid camps. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=407.14s)]
*  Half the population is struggling to find food. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=413.06s)]
*  I think the Haitian people are really torn about the Kenyan police officers. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=416.3s)]
*  On the one hand, yeah, they're absolutely thrilled that somebody's here to help them [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=422.58s)]
*  and trying to get portions of the city, if not hopefully the whole country, back from [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=428.06s)]
*  the gangs. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=432.14s)]
*  But it would be dishonest to say anything except the fact that they're disappointed. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  They're disappointed in the results so far. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=438.58s)]
*  There aren't that many Kenyans in Haiti yet. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=440.78s)]
*  There was supposed to be 2,500 of them and there were only 400. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  There's only so much 400 people can do. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=449.22s)]
*  And so the Haitian people are really feeling frustrated and they're desperate and they [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=452.54s)]
*  want to know when the rest of the world is going to notice. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=459.64000000000004s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=470.42s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a roundtable of Times political reporters who break down the latest [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=472.46000000000004s)]
*  news from the campaign trail. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=476.94s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=479.62s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTBmzuP8xo&t=485.65999999999997s)]
