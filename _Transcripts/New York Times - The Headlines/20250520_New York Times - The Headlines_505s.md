# Trump’s Russia Reversal, Rep. McIver Charged After ICE Clash, TikTok's New Feature | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, May 20th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=7.88s)]
*  Did I talk to him about it? I said, when are we going to end this Vladimir? I've known [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=8.88s)]
*  for a long time now. I said, when are we going to end this bloodshed, this blood bath? It's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=17.36s)]
*  a blood bath. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=23.0s)]
*  After a two hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday, President Trump seems [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=24.0s)]
*  to have backed down from his demand for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. It's something [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=29.08s)]
*  he publicly called for earlier this month, even threatening Russia with sanctions if [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=34.16s)]
*  it didn't agree. But he's now endorsing what Putin has proposed, extended negotiations [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=38.4s)]
*  with no pause in the fighting. In another pivot, while Trump previously claimed he'd [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=44.68s)]
*  personally be able to broker an end to the war, he said yesterday that Russia and Ukraine [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=49.72s)]
*  themselves are best suited to work out an agreement. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=54.26s)]
*  Big ego's involved, I tell you. Big ego's involved. But I think something's going to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=58.2s)]
*  happen. And if it doesn't, I'd just back away and they're going to have to keep going. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=62.6s)]
*  Trump now seems at least somewhat eager to surrender his role as mediator altogether. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=67.72s)]
*  He pointed to the Pope's recent offer to host negotiations at the Vatican, saying, let the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=72.86s)]
*  process begin. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=77.72s)]
*  After the call with Putin and two phone calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  Trump leaned into the potential economic benefits to the end of the war, saying that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=85.5s)]
*  Russia eventually wanted large-scale trade with the U.S. And in Russia's recap of the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=90.14s)]
*  conversation, Putin's foreign policy adviser told reporters that Trump, quote, spoke quite [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=95.02s)]
*  emotionally about the future of the U.S.-Russia relationship and said Russia would be a key [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=100.54s)]
*  trading partner for the U.S. in the future. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  In Gaza yesterday, a few trucks carrying food were allowed to enter the territory, the first [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=114.04s)]
*  in over two months. Since March, Israel's been blocking all food and fuel as a pressure [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=120.12s)]
*  tactic against Hamas. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=125.72s)]
*  For Prime Minister Netanyahu to suddenly announce that Israel was letting aid back into the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=127.72s)]
*  Gaza Strip was something of a surprise. It was a big turnaround. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=135.36s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley is the Times' Jerusalem bureau chief. He says aid groups and the United [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=140.48s)]
*  Nations have been repeatedly warning that Gazans are on the brink of starvation. And [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  in recent days, President Trump also joined in, warning about the growing humanitarian [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=149.6s)]
*  crisis. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=154.64s)]
*  That seems to have been a tipping point for Netanyahu, seeing the president of the world's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=155.88s)]
*  most powerful country, a country that sends billions of dollars in military aid, on which [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  Israel's military campaign in Gaza depends, suddenly joined that group of critics saying [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=167.34s)]
*  that Gaza is on the brink of starvation and something needs to be done about it. And Netanyahu [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=171.94s)]
*  made an explicit reference to this diplomatic pressure on Monday when he said, we must not [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=178.1s)]
*  reach a point of starvation, both as a matter of fact, but also as a diplomatic issue. Without [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=184.58s)]
*  the resumption of aid, Israel, quote, will not be supported and we will not be able to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=191.12s)]
*  achieve victory. So it's not an act of philanthropy. It is a reversal that has been made to help [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=196.84s)]
*  Israel sustain what little diplomatic support it has for its war in order to continue that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=204.28s)]
*  war for the foreseeable future. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=210.96s)]
*  Patrick says that as of this morning, just nine trucks have been let into Gaza, compared [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=214.08s)]
*  to the dozens, if not hundreds of trucks a day that were crossing into the territory [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=218.86s)]
*  before the blockade. Israel's also continued to carry out deadly airstrikes on Gaza and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=222.38000000000002s)]
*  has said it's preparing for a major new ground offensive. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=227.9s)]
*  The DHS says that in their words, you were body slamming an ICE officer. Is that what [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  happened? Absolutely no. I mean, I honestly do not know how to body slam anyone. There's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=247.7s)]
*  no video that supports me body slamming anyone. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=253.5s)]
*  The Justice Department has charged a member of Congress from New Jersey with assault over [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=257.38s)]
*  a clash with federal agents outside an immigration detention center. On May 9th, Representative [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=262.2s)]
*  LaMonica McIver went to tour a building in Newark that had recently been converted by [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  a private prison company into a detention center under a billion dollar contract with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  the Trump administration. McIver and other Democratic members of Congress went to inspect [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=276.82s)]
*  the conditions there, concerned that it had been opened without proper permits. They tried [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=281.61999999999995s)]
*  to bring the mayor of Newark with them inside and a chaotic scuffle broke out as they were [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=286.7s)]
*  met by federal agents wearing face coverings and military fatigues. Body cam footage released [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=291.61999999999995s)]
*  by the Department of Homeland Security appears to show McIver pushing a law enforcement officer [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=297.61999999999995s)]
*  in the crowd. Footage captured by a bystander from another angle seems to show McIver was [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  also being shoved from behind herself. Newark's mayor was arrested and charged with trespassing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=308.1s)]
*  That has since been dropped. But McIver now faces charges for assaulting, impeding, and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=314.26s)]
*  interfering with law enforcement. In a statement, McIver alleged the charges against her are [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=319.26s)]
*  political and accused federal agents of instigating the clash. The detention center in Newark, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=324.02000000000004s)]
*  which can hold up to a thousand people, is part of the administration's efforts nationwide [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=329.94s)]
*  to expand holding facilities as it tries to step up immigration enforcement and deportations. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=334.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court announced it will allow the Trump administration to remove [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=341.38s)]
*  protections for nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants. The migrants have been allowed [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=350.38s)]
*  to live and work in the U.S. legally under a Biden-era expansion of the Temporary Protected [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=356.12s)]
*  Status Program, which the Trump administration has moved to end. That effort has been met [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  with legal challenges, which are still working their way through lower courts. But for now, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=366.36s)]
*  the Supreme Court's order potentially puts the migrants at risk of deportation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  And finally, if you have ever made the mistake of opening up TikTok late at night when you [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  totally intended to go to sleep, you know the feeling of scrolling and scrolling, and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=384.68s)]
*  all of a sudden it's 2 a.m. and you've watched a skincare tutorial and a viral dance trend [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=395.68s)]
*  and a hack about how to make the perfect fried egg and you really should just have gone to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=399.88s)]
*  sleep? Well, this week, TikTok itself has rolled out a new option to try and break that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=403.44s)]
*  doom scrolling cycle. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=410.8s)]
*  I'm Dr. Willow. I'm a child psychiatrist and a mom, and I want to remind you that your [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=412.44s)]
*  brain needs sleep to function. The new feature is specifically aimed at kids. Starting at [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  10 p.m., all TikTok users under 18 now see their For You page turn into a blue screen [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=420.8s)]
*  with relaxing music and a guided meditation session. It's that easy to get a restful, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=427.92s)]
*  uninterrupted sleep, and I promise your brain will thank you. Good night, TikTok. Naturally, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  TikTok is promoting the new feature with a child psychiatrist who's a paid influencer. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  The update comes just months after more than a dozen states sued the company, accusing [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=445.04s)]
*  it of creating an intentionally addictive app that harms children and teenagers. The [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=449.66s)]
*  state said the app is designed to make young users lose track of time and keep their attention [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=454.64s)]
*  so that TikTok can show them more targeted ads. The meditation feature is optional. You [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=460.04s)]
*  can dismiss it when it pops up. An hour later, another prompt will show up, checking in again [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=466.0s)]
*  about whether you want to keep scrolling. One child mental health expert the Times talked [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=471.34s)]
*  to said the new feature might be helpful for some kids who already feel like their doom [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=476.23999999999995s)]
*  scrolling is a problem. But one 15-year-old told the Times that the feature was just annoying. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=480.97999999999996s)]
*  Quote, I have free will, so I just click off. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=486.32s)]
*  Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qzx2QKm1iQ&t=489.32s)]
