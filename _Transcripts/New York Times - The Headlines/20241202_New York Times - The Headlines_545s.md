# Biden Pardons His Son Hunter in U-Turn, and Syrian Rebels’ Surprise Advance
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, December [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=0.0s)]
*  2nd. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  President Biden has issued a full and unconditional pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, using the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  power of the presidency to wave aside years of Hunter's legal troubles. His son was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=19.8s)]
*  set to be sentenced later this month for tax evasion and federal gun charges. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=25.28s)]
*  This is an extraordinary moment for the Biden presidency, and it's extraordinary because [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=30.28s)]
*  it's essentially a reversal. It's a flip flop. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=34.72s)]
*  Zolan Kano-Young covers the White House for the Times. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=37.32s)]
*  The president said this year that he would not issue a pardon, that he would not use [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=40.2s)]
*  his clemency powers for his son. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=47.32s)]
*  And his press secretary repeated that denial on multiple occasions for months. And we [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=50.08s)]
*  are now seeing that that's not the case. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  In a statement, President Biden announced that he was issuing the pardon because he [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=59.16s)]
*  believed the cases against Hunter were politically motivated and claimed that his opponents [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=63.16s)]
*  were going after his son in order to reach him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=68.56s)]
*  He said that while he still believes in the justice system, quote, I also believe raw [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=71.6s)]
*  politics has infected this process. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=76.2s)]
*  Zolan says that reasoning is a remarkable turnaround for Biden, who repeatedly insisted [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=79.24s)]
*  he would never interfere with the Justice Department and campaigned on that promise. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=84.44s)]
*  The pardon comes less than two months before Donald Trump will return to office, where [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=89.72s)]
*  he had promised to go after Hunter. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  The president's son had faced as much as 25 years in prison, but was unlikely to receive [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=96.36s)]
*  anywhere near that as a first time offender. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=100.96s)]
*  This is not the only time a president has used his executive power to pardon a family [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  member. Both Trump and Bill Clinton did so in their terms. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=108.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump is doubling down on his vows to upend the nation's law [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=117.28s)]
*  enforcement agencies, naming Kash Patel, a hardline critic of the FBI, as his pick to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  run the bureau. Patel, who has worked as a federal prosecutor and public defender, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=129.4s)]
*  has little law enforcement or management experience, but he's been fiercely loyal to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=134.72s)]
*  Trump. He's promised to bring federal law enforcement, quote, to heel and amplified [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=139.8s)]
*  Trump's claims that the agency is part of a deep state conspiracy against him. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=145.84s)]
*  Patel even wrote a children's book about how Trump was investigated for potential ties [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=150.76s)]
*  to Russia, calling it, quote, the plot against the king, starring King Donald. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=155.32s)]
*  During Trump's first administration, Patel cycled through several roles, but his bombast [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=161.32s)]
*  and embrace of conspiracy theories made many people in Washington nervous. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  At one point near the end of his term, Trump floated the idea of making Patel the deputy [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=171.4s)]
*  director of the FBI. The attorney general at the time, William Barr, said in his memoir [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=175.84s)]
*  that would only have happened, quote, over my dead body. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=180.6s)]
*  Patel will now face what could be a contentious confirmation process in the Senate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=184.28s)]
*  Over the weekend, Trump continued to fill out other roles in his administration, and he [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=190.68s)]
*  gave two posts to members of his extended family. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=194.72s)]
*  He tapped Masad Boulos, his daughter Tiffany's father-in-law, to be a senior adviser on [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  Middle Eastern affairs. Boulos is a Lebanese-American businessman, and he picked [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=203.84s)]
*  Charles Kushner, a wealthy real estate executive, and Ivanka's father-in-law to serve [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=209.24s)]
*  as ambassador to France. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=214.48s)]
*  In Syria, a surprise attack by rebel groups has reignited a civil war that had been [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=222.04s)]
*  largely dormant for years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=227.0s)]
*  Over the weekend, rebels took control of huge swaths of the country, including most of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=229.24s)]
*  Aleppo, Syria's second largest city. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=233.92s)]
*  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has violently crushed other uprisings over the last [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  decade, even deploying chemical weapons. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=241.84s)]
*  And he's relied on the help of three key allies to stay in control, Iran, Hezbollah [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=244.88s)]
*  and Russia. But now all those allies are distracted or weakened by their own conflict. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=251.24s)]
*  And this is one of the most serious challenges to President Bashar al-Assad's rule that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=258.04s)]
*  he's seen in many years. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  My colleague Raja Abdul Rahim covers the Middle East. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=265.28s)]
*  She says that the rebels' timing was strategic, with Hezbollah and Iran both fighting [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel and Russia bogged down in Ukraine. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=272.6s)]
*  So what analysts are telling me is that these rebel groups, especially the one leading [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=275.76s)]
*  the offensive, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has been watching all these developments very [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=281.28s)]
*  closely and has been training and increasing their military capabilities at the same [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  time and timed their offensive when they thought it would be most opportune. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=291.56s)]
*  And Assad was at his weakest. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=296.48s)]
*  What we'll be watching for now is, A, will the rebels continue to advance? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=298.68s)]
*  And B, what is going to happen to the areas that they have taken? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=303.96s)]
*  The main thing that has changed the balance of power in Syria over the years has been [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  air power. The Assad regime has air power and his allies have air power. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=312.64s)]
*  The rebels have never had air power. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=317.88s)]
*  So what we're seeing now is rebel-held areas being bombed, civilians are being [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=319.88s)]
*  killed. So we're going to be watching, can the rebels hold on to the territory that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=324.6s)]
*  they just captured? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=329.72s)]
*  In Mexico, the Times has been looking at one way the powerful Sinaloa cartel is trying [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  to expand its drug empire. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=345.56s)]
*  The criminal group is largely responsible for the fentanyl pouring across the border [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=348.08s)]
*  into the U.S. and it's been recruiting from an unexpected talent pool targeting [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=352.4s)]
*  chemistry students at Mexican universities. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=357.52s)]
*  They show up on these university campuses. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=360.56s)]
*  They're sometimes in disguise. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=362.96s)]
*  One student told me that he was approached by a man who looked like a janitor but was [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=364.44s)]
*  actually a cartel recruiter. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=368.72s)]
*  Times Mexico City Bureau Chief Natalie Kichereff has been speaking with students, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=370.6s)]
*  professors and cartel members. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=374.52s)]
*  There's a really sophisticated process for bringing these students into the fold. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=376.76s)]
*  First, the cartel starts to talk to family members of the students. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=381.44s)]
*  They talk to friends, even people they play soccer with to find out if these are the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=385.04s)]
*  right types of people for the job. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=389.72s)]
*  If they're discreet, if they're hardworking, then they show up on campus and they offer [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=391.88s)]
*  to pay the students big money, big salaries and often to sponsor their tuition. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=396.56s)]
*  And then if they say yes, sometimes they're blindfolded, taken to a secret lab in the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=402.24s)]
*  mountains and they begin cooking. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=407.52s)]
*  Natalie says the cartel has ambitious goals for the students. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=409.88s)]
*  Some young chemists who've been arrested told authorities they were working to make [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=414.08s)]
*  the fentanyl more addictive. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=418.28s)]
*  The cartels also want their help to overcome a major roadblock in the fentanyl production [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=420.52s)]
*  process. Right now, they're largely dependent on getting the necessary ingredients from [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=425.56s)]
*  China. But the pandemic scrambled those supply chains and both Chinese and Mexican [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=430.36s)]
*  authorities have stepped up enforcement. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=435.88s)]
*  So being able to make the chemicals themselves would be a game changer. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=438.0s)]
*  If they are able to eventually do this, something that U.S. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=442.2s)]
*  officials say is possible, this would make the cartel more powerful than ever. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=445.56s)]
*  It would give them even greater control over the supply chain for one of the deadliest [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  drugs around. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=455.48s)]
*  One of the students that we talked to said it would make us the kings of Mexico. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=457.12s)]
*  And finally, the word of the year, according to the publisher of the Oxford English [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  Dictionary, is brain rot, specifically the kind of brain rot that comes from digital [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=470.0s)]
*  overload. The I know that I picked up my phone to look something up, but that was two [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=475.64000000000004s)]
*  hours ago and I have no idea how I ended up on a video about artisan ham brain rot. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=480.24s)]
*  As the publisher's official definition puts it, it's the deterioration of your brain [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=486.04s)]
*  due to the overconsumption of trivial content, often online. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  Oxford said the use of the term surged over 200 percent this year, but the earliest [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  appearance of the term came way before you could even doom scroll. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=500.92s)]
*  Henry David Thoreau used brain rot in 1854 in his classic Walden. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  At the time, Thoreau was wondering if anyone would ever try to cure it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=510.88s)]
*  Still a solid question. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=515.48s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily as Trump promises sweeping new tariffs. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=520.64s)]
*  A look at what happened when he rolled out similar policies during his first term. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=526.68s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=531.48s)]
*  podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=534.8399999999999s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLO598s4N7k&t=537.3199999999999s)]
