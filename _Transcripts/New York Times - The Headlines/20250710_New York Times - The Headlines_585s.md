# New Details on Camp Mystic, and Trump’s Retribution Campaign
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, July [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=0.0s)]
*  10th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=7.44s)]
*  A new Times analysis of Camp Mystic, where at least two dozen young campers and staffers [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=13.84s)]
*  died in the recent flash flooding, has found that many of the cabins were built in a designated [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  flood zone. Some of them were in an area the county had deemed extremely hazardous. The [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=25.64s)]
*  camp sits on the banks of the Guadalupe River in a region known as Flash Flood Alley, and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=31.4s)]
*  camp managers and emergency officials had known the river posed a danger for decades. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=37.36s)]
*  In 1987, 10 teenagers at a different camp in the area were killed in flooding. Since [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=42.8s)]
*  then, dozens more people in the region have died in flash floods. But at Camp Mystic, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=48.28s)]
*  the Times found some of the cabins sat so close to the river's edge that they were [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=53.34s)]
*  technically in the river's floodway, a type of area so at risk that many states severely [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=58.06s)]
*  restrict construction there. And when the camp carried out a multi-million dollar expansion [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  six years ago, local officials signed off on adding new cabins that were also in the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=69.26s)]
*  flood zone. One flood risk expert told the Times that was like pitching a tent in the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=74.9s)]
*  middle of a highway. Camp Mystic didn't immediately respond to questions about the construction [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=80.22000000000001s)]
*  of the cabins. Just two days before the flood, the camp passed a state inspection. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=85.78s)]
*  The challenges that we face is tremendous amount. We're talking mounds of debris that is in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=92.86000000000001s)]
*  the river. Meanwhile, across the region, search teams are still digging through the muddy [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=99.18s)]
*  wreckage of the flash floods, which killed at least 120 people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  We are finding vehicles and RVs deep inside the debris that you can't even see from the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=108.89999999999999s)]
*  outside. More than 170 people are still missing and no survivors have been found since Friday, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  suggesting the death toll could more than double. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=120.33999999999999s)]
*  The Trump administration appears to be taking steps to target officials who once [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=129.06s)]
*  investigated Donald Trump. They've narrowed in on two men. One is John Brennan, who led the CIA [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=133.66000000000003s)]
*  when it investigated the 2016 Trump campaign's connections to Russia. The other is James [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=140.46s)]
*  Comey, who led the FBI during that time. Trump repeatedly denounced the whole thing as, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=146.10000000000002s)]
*  quote, the Russia hoax. Now, the current CIA director has made a criminal referral of Brennan, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  accusing him of lying to Congress when he testified about the investigation. The FBI is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=157.34s)]
*  also scrutinizing Comey. Both of these disgraceful individuals turned against our [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=162.18s)]
*  Constitution and our country. And I'm sure they did, in fact, lie to Congress. And it's up to the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=167.70000000000002s)]
*  Department of Justice to investigate that. While the FBI and CIA declined to comment, White House [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  press secretary Caroline Levitt celebrated the developments in an interview on Fox News. The [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=177.78s)]
*  deep state threw everything at him to prevent him from coming back to this big, beautiful White [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  House behind me. And he prevailed. And I'm glad to see the Department of Justice is opening up [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=187.22s)]
*  this investigation. Even if these initial steps do not lead to criminal charges, they're some of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=191.66s)]
*  the most significant signs yet that the administration intends to carry out a retribution [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=197.14s)]
*  campaign against the president's perceived enemies. In another indication of how closely the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=202.5s)]
*  government is scrutinizing Comey in particular, the Times has learned that the Secret Service [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=208.82s)]
*  tracked him after he put up an Instagram post critical of Trump. In May, Comey posted a picture [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=213.82s)]
*  of seashells that spelled out 8647, 86 being slang for dismiss or remove, 47 referring to Trump [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=219.86s)]
*  as the 47th president. In response, Donald Trump Jr. claimed Comey was, quote, casually calling [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=228.5s)]
*  for my dad to be murdered, which fueled an online flurry of accusations that Comey was plotting to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  assassinate the president. Comey deleted the post, saying he didn't know it had any kind of violent [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=240.9s)]
*  connotation. 8647 and 8646 referring to President Biden are such common taglines, you can buy t [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=246.82s)]
*  shirts with that on it from Amazon. But the Secret Service tracked the location of Comey's cell [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=255.14s)]
*  phone and had him followed in unmarked cars before he was called in for an interview in Washington. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=260.5s)]
*  Former Secret Service officials tell the Times those methods would typically be used for someone [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=266.9s)]
*  considered an active threat. And a former US attorney called it, quote, huge overkill. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=271.74s)]
*  At the White House yesterday, President Trump took his global trade war into new territory, using the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=285.26s)]
*  threat of steep tariffs to intervene in a criminal trial in Brazil that he's called a witch hunt. In a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=291.1s)]
*  letter to Brazil's president, Trump said that he plans to put a 50% surcharge on all Brazilian [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=297.86s)]
*  imports, citing the ongoing prosecution of the country's former leader Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=303.38s)]
*  faces possible prison time for allegedly attempting a violent coup back in 2022 after he lost his [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=309.86s)]
*  reelection campaign. Trump has drawn parallels to the criminal charges he faced after losing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=315.82s)]
*  reelection, saying it happened to me times 10. Beyond his apparent demand that Brazil end the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  prosecution, Trump said the new tariffs were also needed to level America's economic playing field [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=327.74s)]
*  with Brazil. He claimed incorrectly that the US has a trade deficit with the country. In response, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=333.14s)]
*  Brazil's president said it will reciprocate with its own tariffs on the US, writing in a statement, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=339.5s)]
*  quote, Brazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions that will not accept being [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=344.82s)]
*  abused by anyone. An escalating trade war could have serious impact on the Brazilian economy. The [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=350.14s)]
*  US is its second largest trading partner. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=356.1s)]
*  Prevention shows that the US has hit a grim milestone. There have been more cases of measles [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=367.5s)]
*  this year than in any year since the virus was declared eliminated in the country back in 2000. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=373.42s)]
*  Nearly 1300 people across dozens of states have had confirmed cases of the highly contagious [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=378.78s)]
*  disease, which can lead to serious long-term health issues, especially for kids. Of those people, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=385.14s)]
*  over 90% were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Public health experts [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=390.97999999999996s)]
*  say that growing skepticism has caused vaccination rates to slip across the country, creating a [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=397.78s)]
*  dangerous opening for measles to spread. And efforts by local public health officials to get [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=403.38s)]
*  it under control have been hamstrung by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  Jr., who's downplayed the outbreaks and offered only muted support for vaccines. The spread of [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=413.3s)]
*  measles could be an early sign that other vaccine-preventable diseases like whooping [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=420.06s)]
*  cough and meningitis could also become more common. One epidemiologist told the Times, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=424.66s)]
*  quote, it's a huge red flag for the direction in which we're going. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=429.74s)]
*  And finally, the Times has announced two new chief restaurant critics who will be traveling [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=433.5s)]
*  the country reporting on the changing landscape of American cuisine. Ligaya Mashan will be based [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=447.46s)]
*  in New York and Tejal Rao will be based in California. I moved to the United States as [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=452.78s)]
*  a teenager and my parents who are Indian and East African Asian, they started shopping at [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=457.94s)]
*  Mexican grocery stores. So I was putting the leftover chicken curry made with tons of cumin [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=464.02s)]
*  and black pepper, ginger, garlic, green chilies. I would put that in a hot flour tortilla with [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=470.1s)]
*  some melted cheese. And I would think that I was some kind of culinary genius. Tejal says one of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=475.86s)]
*  the things she'll explore is how food and history overlap, like in the mix of Mexican and Indian [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=482.9s)]
*  flavors she first encountered as a kid. In fact, the cuisine has a surprising and mostly forgotten [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  history in the US. In the late 1800s, Punjabi Sikh and Muslim men immigrated from India and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=494.5s)]
*  they were looking for work as farmers and loggers on the West Coast. But after the Immigration Act [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=501.02s)]
*  of 1917 made it impossible for women from their communities back home to join them. Hundreds of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=507.85999999999996s)]
*  these men ended up marrying Mexican women and starting families together outside of Sacramento. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=515.22s)]
*  New kinds of cooking came from these Mexican Indian American homes in a really natural way [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=520.98s)]
*  because cuisines and ingredients and tastes and habits all collide in the kitchen. This community [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=528.74s)]
*  had their own restaurants too. They served roti quesadillas filled with cheese and onions and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=535.5s)]
*  shredded beef and all kinds of South Asian curries with Spanish rice, a beef chile verde with parathas [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=540.7s)]
*  and years later dining at restaurants. I've been seeing Indian Mexican food interpreted [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=549.34s)]
*  in really different ways and at so many different places. And I love how a restaurant can kind of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=554.06s)]
*  pick up a thread of history like this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=559.66s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, more on Trump's escalating global trade war. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=567.74s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=573.5s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlNXUagwFWs&t=577.98s)]
