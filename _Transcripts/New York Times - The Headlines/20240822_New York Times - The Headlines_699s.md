# Kennedy Is Expected to Drop Out, and Revised Data Shows Job Market Cracks
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ)
*  I'm Julian Barnes. I'm an intelligence reporter at the New York Times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I try to find out what the US government is keeping secret. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=4.0s)]
*  It takes a lot of time to find people willing to talk about those secrets. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=7.0s)]
*  It requires talking to a lot of people to make sure that we're not misled [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=12.0s)]
*  and that we give a complete story to our readers. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=16.0s)]
*  If the New York Times was not reporting these stories, some of them might never come to light. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=19.0s)]
*  If you want to support this kind of work, you can do that by subscribing to the New York Times. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=26.0s)]
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=33.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, August 22nd. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=35.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=38.0s)]
*  Your vice president candidate said you were contemplating dropping out. Are you? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=44.0s)]
*  Thank you, Bobby. Thank you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=47.0s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s bid for the White House appears to be almost over. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=50.0s)]
*  The Times has learned that Kennedy is expected to end his presidential campaign this week [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=55.0s)]
*  and that he's in talks to endorse Donald Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=60.0s)]
*  His campaign has said that Kennedy will announce his, quote, path forward tomorrow. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=63.0s)]
*  And three people familiar with his plans say that while he could change his mind, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=69.0s)]
*  discussions are underway for him to appear alongside Trump at a rally in Arizona. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=73.0s)]
*  Kennedy's exit from the race, less than three months before the election, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=79.0s)]
*  would close out one of the most durable third-party presidential bids in modern American history. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=83.0s)]
*  Earlier this year, some polls had Kennedy pulling in double-digit support [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=89.0s)]
*  with the potential to draw a meaningful number of votes away from both Democrats and Republicans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=93.0s)]
*  But in recent weeks, his poll numbers have plunged. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=99.0s)]
*  His campaign has been running out of cash, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=103.0s)]
*  and his efforts to get on state ballots have been caught up in legal challenges. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=105.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Chicago last night... [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=112.0s)]
*  You know, you might not know it, but I haven't given a lot of big speeches like this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=114.0s)]
*  Tim Walz officially accepted the Democratic Party's nomination to be the vice presidential candidate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=119.0s)]
*  And in the biggest speech of his political career, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=125.0s)]
*  the Minnesota governor and former congressman reached back into his past [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=128.0s)]
*  and went full high school football coach. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=133.0s)]
*  It's the fourth quarter! [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=136.0s)]
*  We're down a field goal, but we're on offense and we've got the ball. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=139.0s)]
*  We're driving down the field. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=144.0s)]
*  And boy, do we have the right team. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=148.0s)]
*  Democrats are hoping that Walz's Midwestern background, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=151.0s)]
*  including his love of football and hunting, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=154.0s)]
*  will help win over white working-class voters, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=156.0s)]
*  particularly men, who have been turning away from the party in recent years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=159.0s)]
*  We got 76 days. That's nothing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=163.0s)]
*  There'll be time to sleep when you're dead. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=167.0s)]
*  We're going to leave it on the field. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=170.0s)]
*  Walz's self-described pep talk was all part of the high-energy lead-up [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=172.0s)]
*  to the convention's main event, Kamala Harris's speech, which she'll give tonight. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=177.0s)]
*  People close to the campaign tell The Times that Harris feels like this speech [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=182.0s)]
*  is one of the most crucial moments of her campaign. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=187.0s)]
*  She's been going through her speech line by line with her speechwriter, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=190.0s)]
*  who used to work for President Obama. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=193.0s)]
*  And she's practiced the speech, teleprompters included, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=196.0s)]
*  at least three times between other campaign events. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=199.0s)]
*  This is not the speech that the vice president anticipated she would be giving just four weeks ago. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=202.0s)]
*  And now she's had to prepare to introduce herself to the broader political world. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Maya King covers the Harris campaign for The Times. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=213.0s)]
*  In my reporting, largely talking to party organizers and strategists, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=216.0s)]
*  one concern that they have expressed is the handful of independent voters and swing voters [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=221.0s)]
*  who might not yet be sold on her. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=227.0s)]
*  I think both parties recognize that this is an election that will really come down to the margins. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=229.0s)]
*  And so every vote is going to matter here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=234.0s)]
*  And having a message that appeals to the folks who say they don't know her very well quite yet [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=237.0s)]
*  or just might have some skepticism about how she would govern and what her policy portfolio would be, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=242.0s)]
*  this is her chance to talk to them as well tonight. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=247.0s)]
*  Campaign officials say Harris will try to do three main things in her speech. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=250.0s)]
*  Tell the story of her journey from a middle-class background to the vice presidency. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=255.0s)]
*  Frame Donald Trump's campaign as dangerous and backwards-looking. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=260.0s)]
*  And make an unabashed appeal to patriotism, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=264.0s)]
*  a theme that has usually been embraced by Republicans. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=269.0s)]
*  Live coverage of the speech with analysis from Times reporters will be at nytimes.com. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=273.0s)]
*  On Wednesday, the Labor Department came out with revised numbers for how the job market's been doing, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=284.0s)]
*  and they show the U.S. economy has added far fewer jobs than previously thought. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=290.0s)]
*  From last March to this March, the data shows the U.S. added 818,000 fewer jobs than the Labor Department originally reported. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=296.0s)]
*  Revising the numbers like this happens every year, as more detailed data comes in, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=305.0s)]
*  but this year's revision is unusually large and could be the latest sign of potential weakness in the job market. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=310.0s)]
*  Still, experts say the update doesn't change the larger economic picture. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=317.0s)]
*  Job growth is slowing but not collapsing, and the unemployment rate is rising, but layoffs are still low. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=323.0s)]
*  Overnight, all freight traffic on Canada's railroads came to a standstill [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=335.0s)]
*  after the country's two main rail companies locked out their employees in a labor dispute. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=340.0s)]
*  The companies, Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=345.0s)]
*  have told 10,000 employees not to show up to work, halting trains and potentially disrupting the supply chain. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=349.0s)]
*  The companies have been negotiating with the workers since September, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=356.0s)]
*  and some of the key sticking points have been over scheduling and concerns about fatigue. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=360.0s)]
*  A union representing the workers accused the companies of pushing changes that would force crews to stay awake longer, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=365.0s)]
*  threatening derailments and other safety issues. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=372.0s)]
*  The companies dispute that, saying their proposals do not compromise safety, and one called the union's demands unrealistic. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=376.0s)]
*  The shutdown could have serious economic consequences. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=383.0s)]
*  By one estimate, half of all Canadian exports are moved by trains. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=387.0s)]
*  Timing-wise, it's right at the start of the grain harvest, and farmers may have to stockpile their grain for now. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=393.0s)]
*  It could also affect major car companies. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=399.0s)]
*  Honda and Toyota both have big factories in Canada, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=402.0s)]
*  and those finished vehicles are largely sent to the U.S. on trains, which are now stopped. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=406.0s)]
*  MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, announced that it's had a sharp decline in racial diversity [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=417.0s)]
*  for its incoming class of freshmen, the first class to be admitted since the Supreme Court banned affirmative action. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=424.0s)]
*  The court-ruled race can no longer be considered during the admissions process, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=432.0s)]
*  and MIT is the first major university to release its data since then. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=436.0s)]
*  It shows that the number of students who are Black, Latino, Native American, or Pacific Islander is now 16%, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=441.0s)]
*  down from about 25% in previous years. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=448.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the number of admitted students who are Asian American rose from 40% to 47%. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=452.0s)]
*  In a statement, MIT's president said the ruling essentially undid decades of work the school had put in to achieve racial and ethnic diversity. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=459.0s)]
*  But the founder of the group that pushed for the nationwide ban on affirmative action [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=470.0s)]
*  said that every incoming student to MIT will now know, quote, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=474.0s)]
*  that they were accepted only based on their outstanding academic and extracurricular achievements, not the color of their skin. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=478.0s)]
*  MIT's results are consistent with what's happened when affirmative action was banned at a state level. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=486.0s)]
*  Public universities in both California and Michigan saw notable drop-offs in the number of Black students [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=492.0s)]
*  after they could no longer take race under consideration. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=498.0s)]
*  And finally, The Times has been reporting on how Mennonite communities are expanding in Latin America. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=501.0s)]
*  The religious communities started moving there about a century ago, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=506.0s)]
*  and there are now more than 200 settlements in the region covering almost 10 million acres of land. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=510.0s)]
*  Some have carved out colonies deep in the Amazon rainforest, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=516.0s)]
*  and some have found their way to the Amazon rainforest. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=521.0s)]
*  They are defined in a lot of ways by rejecting modern technology [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=526.0s)]
*  and trying to live separate from the rest of the world. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=531.0s)]
*  But another thing is that land is pretty cheap there, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=534.0s)]
*  and they don't mind doing the work to clear the forest, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=537.0s)]
*  and they want to have large tracts of land in order to kind of maintain their lifestyle. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=540.0s)]
*  Reporter Mitra Taj traveled by plane, boat, and motorcycle to reach two of the colonies. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=545.0s)]
*  When we arrived, it didn't really look like Peru anymore. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=550.0s)]
*  It was very kind of orderly streets, very square fields, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=553.0s)]
*  not at all like typical Peruvian farms, which tend to be smaller, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=556.0s)]
*  kind of big fields that would just run up right into the forest. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=560.0s)]
*  There's horse-drawn buggies moving around, boys collecting milk in canisters. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=564.0s)]
*  But there were signs of the Amazon everywhere. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=569.0s)]
*  The first person who would go to the Amazon was a young woman. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=572.0s)]
*  The first person we spoke with, the leader of the colony Providencia, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=575.0s)]
*  had a parrot in his house that would speak in the German dialect that the Mennonites speak in. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=579.0s)]
*  Mitra says that in Peru, there are some tensions around the Mennonites' use of the forest. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=585.0s)]
*  The government has now opened investigations into the communities [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=591.0s)]
*  for clearing the forest without required permits, something they deny. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=595.0s)]
*  And environmentally, the government has been trying to make sure that the forest [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=599.0s)]
*  is cleared, but they don't want to be denied. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=603.0s)]
*  And environmentalists are also raising concerns that the colonies are damaging the rainforest [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=606.0s)]
*  and exacerbating climate change. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=610.0s)]
*  The Amazon is already under stress from much larger threats like logging, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=613.0s)]
*  cattle ranching, and mining. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=617.0s)]
*  The Mennonites themselves say, they do acknowledge that they cleared forest [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=620.0s)]
*  in order to build their colony, but they look around and they say the forest is big. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=623.0s)]
*  And they weren't familiar with the term climate change, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=628.0s)]
*  they weren't familiar with the role that the trees and keeping the trees standing plays [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=632.0s)]
*  in avoiding worsening climate change. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=637.0s)]
*  But it will be interesting to see if authorities are able to stop Mennonites from expanding [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=640.0s)]
*  into the forest, to see how quickly and whether or not these Mennonite colonies [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=646.0s)]
*  expand as they have in other countries. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=651.0s)]
*  These are people that are trying really hard to live apart from the rest of the world, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=654.0s)]
*  but once a colony is successful enough, rooted enough, it gets big enough [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=659.0s)]
*  for other people in the colonies to want to break off and start a new colony [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=664.0s)]
*  somewhere that's even more remote. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=669.0s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=674.0s)]
*  Today on The Daily, how a Republican takeover of an obscure election board in Georgia [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=676.0s)]
*  could shape the 2024 election. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=681.0s)]
*  You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTgEfcH2tqQ&t=684.0s)]
