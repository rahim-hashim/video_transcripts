# Inside Musk’s Government Takeover, and Frantic Tariff Negotiations
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Tuesday, February 4th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=7.8s)]
*  I don't want to use countries. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=10.8s)]
*  I don't want to use names, but tariffs are very powerful, both economically and in getting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=15.0s)]
*  everything else you want. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=20.48s)]
*  President Trump hit pause on parts of his massive tariff plan yesterday after striking [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=22.64s)]
*  a last minute deal with Mexico and Canada. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=27.38s)]
*  Trump had threatened to put a 25% surcharge in place on imports from those countries unless [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=30.939999999999998s)]
*  they agreed to do more to stop the flow of migrants and fentanyl into the U.S. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=36.44s)]
*  That could have been the first move in a crippling trade war with deep economic consequences [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  for all countries involved. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=46.82s)]
*  But after getting on the phone with Trump, the Prime Minister of Canada and the President [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=49.0s)]
*  of Mexico both promised to take action. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=53.14s)]
*  Mexico said it would send 10,000 troops to secure its side of the border. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=56.66s)]
*  Canada said it will appoint a fentanyl czar and put $200 million into cracking down on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  the drug and fighting organized crime. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=66.5s)]
*  In exchange, Trump agreed to hold off on the tariffs for one month. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=69.46s)]
*  Trump's tariff on China, though, kicked in at midnight. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=74.02s)]
*  It's a 10% surcharge, and China immediately fired back, slapping its own tariffs on a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  range of American products like farm machinery and natural gas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=82.9s)]
*  Overall, the back and forth underscores Trump's willingness to pressure and intimidate foreign [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=87.7s)]
*  countries using tariffs. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=93.34s)]
*  He said this week that tariffs against Europe will definitely happen. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=95.58000000000001s)]
*  But one trade expert told the Times that this new drumbeat of threats could backfire, since [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=100.10000000000001s)]
*  companies and investors might be scared off by the uncertainty and pull back from the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  U.S. economy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=110.18s)]
*  He said, quote, trade policy is an economic weapon that becomes less powerful every time [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=111.74s)]
*  it is used. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  As Trump's administration has been shaking up the federal government, cutting programs, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=123.41999999999999s)]
*  freezing spending, one adviser has been at the center of a lot of the upheaval, Elon [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  Musk. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=133.29999999999998s)]
*  Musk is leading what's been labeled the Department of Government Efficiency, with orders to drastically [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=134.66s)]
*  cut the federal budget. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=139.62s)]
*  He's assembled a team of young engineers to help him, at least one as young as 19. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=141.86s)]
*  They come from some of his companies, like X or SpaceX, but have little to no experience [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=147.46s)]
*  in government policy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=152.38s)]
*  They've been working around the clock. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=154.38s)]
*  Musk even had beds moved into a federal office building so that he and his team can sleep [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=156.66s)]
*  there when they work late. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=161.1s)]
*  Over the last two weeks, the team has been sweeping through agency after agency. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=163.02s)]
*  They've bombarded government employees with messages telling them that they're lazy and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=168.34s)]
*  encouraging them to quit. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  They've taken aim at USAID, which doles out foreign aid, calling it a criminal organization. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=174.26s)]
*  And Musk bragged about feeding the agency into the woodchipper. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk is waging a largely unchecked and certainly unprecedented war against the federal [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=185.3s)]
*  bureaucracy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  My colleague Jonathan Swan has been looking into how Musk is operating. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=192.5s)]
*  He says one of the most unprecedented moves that Musk made was gaining access to the Treasury [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=196.74s)]
*  Department's payment system. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  It contains sensitive information about millions of Americans and data about almost all government [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=204.14000000000001s)]
*  payments. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=209.5s)]
*  Jonathan says that Musk's unfettered access has raised questions about whether he might [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=210.66s)]
*  use that data for his own interests. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  We've never seen anything like this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  He's still a private citizen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=220.38s)]
*  He still retains his interests in all of his companies, which have billions of dollars [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=221.9s)]
*  of federal contracts. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=227.66s)]
*  Many of these companies have been under investigations by the federal government. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=230.06s)]
*  So he's effectively reviewing, auditing, embedding himself and his team within the government [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=233.62s)]
*  that does business with his companies and that regulates his companies. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=239.74s)]
*  It's a scale of conflict of interest that we've never seen before. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=244.14000000000001s)]
*  When we talk to senior administration officials, it's pretty clear that Musk effectively reports [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=248.3s)]
*  to no one. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  He keeps President Trump apprised of what he's doing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  He tells him for sure. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=259.12s)]
*  He's obviously only doing this with Trump's blessing. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=261.04s)]
*  But in terms of operating like a normal federal government employee and seeking approval, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=263.82s)]
*  that's not how he's rolling. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  He is moving really fast, aggressively and with the full authority of President Trump. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=271.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, there has been some pushback to Musk and his role in the administration's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=289.05999999999995s)]
*  efforts to drastically cut government spending. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=293.46s)]
*  Power is threatening lives all over the world. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=301.78s)]
*  Yesterday, Congressman Jamie Raskin and other Democratic lawmakers joined a protest outside [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=305.78s)]
*  of the USAID headquarters, which Musk continues to target. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=310.82s)]
*  They said the recent spending cuts overstep presidential authority by effectively gutting [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=315.38s)]
*  programs that Congress authorized. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=320.46s)]
*  In Southern California, a stretch of the iconic Pacific Coast Highway was reopened on Monday, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  almost a month after the Palisades Fire forced it to close. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=339.46s)]
*  The wildfire tore through the hills above the PCH, jumped the lanes, and destroyed a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=343.26s)]
*  long strip of houses between the highway and the beach. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=348.53999999999996s)]
*  The mayor of Malibu urged people not to go gawk at the damage now that the road is open, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=352.28s)]
*  saying in a statement, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=357.62s)]
*  Please remember that what you are seeing is not just burned structures. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=358.9s)]
*  It is someone's home, their memories, and their loss. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=362.62s)]
*  As the cleanup and recovery continues throughout L.A., there's a new sign of how the fires [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=369.82s)]
*  have pushed California's fragile insurance market to the edge. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=374.9s)]
*  State Farm now wants to raise the rates for homeowners' policies there, roughly 20%. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=379.7s)]
*  Yesterday, the company asked regulators to approve the hike, calling it urgent. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=384.98s)]
*  The company said it's already paid out more than a billion dollars because of the fires [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=389.82s)]
*  and expects that number to go way up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=393.74s)]
*  It already raised rates by 20% less than a year ago. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=396.42s)]
*  At the same time, State Farm and other insurance companies are trying to pull back from California [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=400.18s)]
*  altogether, citing the growing threat of wildfires and other disasters fueled by climate change. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=405.3s)]
*  State Farm stopped writing new policies there last year because of what it called [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=412.02s)]
*  rapidly growing catastrophe exposure. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=416.29999999999995s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=426.14s)]
*  Oh my god! [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=427.14s)]
*  Since finishing this book, I have become obsessed. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=429.14s)]
*  It's got romance, it's got dragons, and it's got a decent chunk of America reading it right now. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  I cannot believe I'm holding this in my hands. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=439.34s)]
*  The book Onyx Storm by Rebecca Yaros has become the fastest-selling novel for adults in 20 [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=443.38s)]
*  years. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  It sold more than 2.7 million copies in its first week, and right now the top three slots [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  on the Times hardcover bestseller list are all Yaros. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=456.73999999999995s)]
*  Onyx Storm is her third novel in a series about dragon riders trained at a military [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=460.9s)]
*  academy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=466.05999999999995s)]
*  The excitement has been driven in part by book talk, video reviews posted on TikTok [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=467.38s)]
*  that can help a book go viral. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=472.42s)]
*  Videos about Yaros and her books have more than a billion views. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=474.74s)]
*  Fans were so hungry for Onyx Storm that they lined up at midnight release parties late [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=479.18s)]
*  last month, something booksellers say they haven't seen since the heyday of Harry Potter [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=483.9s)]
*  and Twilight. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=488.3s)]
*  The book's bestseller status cements the fact that the romance fantasy genre, aka Romanticie, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=489.92s)]
*  with spicy sex scenes and supernatural elements, is not a fleeting trend, but a major new force [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=496.46000000000004s)]
*  in publishing. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=502.86s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily, a play-by-play of Trump's last-minute tariff [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=507.94s)]
*  negotiations with Mexico and Canada. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=513.02s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=516.1s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j598OVRpCVQ&t=520.34s)]
