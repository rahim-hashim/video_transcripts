# A Political Shock in New York, and Democrats Demand Details on Iran Strike
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Will Jarvis in for Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=4.8s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, June 25th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=6.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=9.08s)]
*  Thank you, my friends. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=15.84s)]
*  Tonight we made history. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=21.44s)]
*  In New York City, Zoran Mamdani, a 33-year-old progressive state lawmaker, stunned the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=24.28s)]
*  political establishment as he declared victory in the Democratic primary for mayor. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=30.0s)]
*  We have won because New Yorkers have stood up for a city they can afford. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=34.76s)]
*  A city where they can do more than just struggle. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=41.56s)]
*  The final results are not in, but Mamdani's commanding lead dealt a definitive blow to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  the apparent frontrunner in the race, former Governor Andrew Cuomo. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=49.6s)]
*  I called him. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  I congratulated him. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  I applaud him sincerely for his effort. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=56.12s)]
*  Cuomo conceded the election overnight in what one Democratic strategist called the biggest [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=60.36s)]
*  political upset in modern New York City history. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=65.36s)]
*  Mamdani, who's a Democratic socialist, captured national attention as Democrats around the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=68.48s)]
*  country try to fend off rising discontent from voters and find a new generation of leadership. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=73.56s)]
*  Most New Yorkers did not know Zoran Mamdani's name six months ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=79.68s)]
*  He was a little-known state assembly member from Queens, but he focused on this message [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=84.44s)]
*  of affordability. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=89.72s)]
*  Emma Fitzsimmons is the City Hall bureau chief for the Times. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=91.36s)]
*  She says Tuesday's election was a battle between the Democratic Party's more traditional [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  moderates represented by Cuomo and its left wing, which Mamdani championed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=98.92s)]
*  He talked constantly about his proposals to make the city more affordable, free buses, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=103.72s)]
*  rent freezes, city-owned grocery stores. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=109.56s)]
*  He just kept hammering home these ideas and he ran this upbeat campaign. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=112.8s)]
*  He had a lot of energy and charisma and he really attacked Andrew Cuomo as part of the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  politics of the past. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=123.96s)]
*  He was sort of this happy warrior who would be the first Muslim mayor, but also made an [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=126.0s)]
*  argument for why he was the future of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=131.64s)]
*  If Mamdani does officially win, he'll likely be the frontrunner for the general election [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=136.44s)]
*  in November. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  But it could be a tight race. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=141.84s)]
*  New York's current mayor, Eric Adams, is running as an independent and Cuomo has not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=143.68s)]
*  ruled out doing the same. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=148.5s)]
*  The Times has learned that a preliminary classified report from the Pentagon suggests President [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=156.6s)]
*  Trump overstated the success of the recent U.S. attacks on Iran. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=161.58s)]
*  Over the weekend, the president claimed that American forces had, quote, obliterated Iran's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=166.14s)]
*  nuclear facilities using so-called bunker buster bombs and missiles launched from a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=170.82s)]
*  submarine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=176.05999999999997s)]
*  But the early assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency says that while the strikes [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=177.05999999999997s)]
*  caused moderate to severe damage, they didn't fully destroy the underground facilities they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=181.44s)]
*  targeted. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=186.26s)]
*  Military experts have said it could take days or even weeks of repeated bombing to take [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=187.77999999999997s)]
*  out one of the facilities, which was buried hundreds of feet under a mountain. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=192.16s)]
*  The report also says that before the strikes, Iran had been able to move much of its enriched [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=196.28s)]
*  uranium to other locations. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=200.84s)]
*  Overall, the analysis estimates that Iran's nuclear program was set back by less than [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=202.92s)]
*  six months. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=207.48s)]
*  Since he announced the covert strikes, President Trump has repeatedly complained to his advisors [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=209.1s)]
*  about news reports questioning how much damage was done. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=213.48s)]
*  And the White House press secretary said, quote, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=217.0s)]
*  The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=219.4s)]
*  and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=224.04s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon is now working with the FBI to investigate [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  who leaked the report. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=234.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  Why is the Trump administration playing political games on questions of war and peace? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=240.88s)]
*  Outrage is growing among Democratic lawmakers after the White House postponed a classified [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=247.92s)]
*  briefing about the strikes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=252.64s)]
*  We have an administration that won't talk truthfully and honestly about matters of national [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=254.56s)]
*  security and potentially taking us into another war in the Middle East. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=260.52s)]
*  House and Senate lawmakers had been told they would be briefed yesterday by the CIA director [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=268.12s)]
*  and other officials about the aftermath of the attack. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=272.64s)]
*  Those meetings have been pushed off until tomorrow and Friday, and Democratic leaders [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=275.8s)]
*  say the administration is failing to meet its legal obligations. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=279.64s)]
*  Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to notify Congress within [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  48 hours of any military action and provide a classified briefing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  They've also questioned the president's justification for the strikes, with House Minority Leader [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=293.92s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries saying he's seen no evidence the strikes were justified or that there was [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=298.42s)]
*  any imminent threat to the United States. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=303.12s)]
*  In the Netherlands, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=311.8s)]
*  If Trump would not have been elected president of the United States, do you really think [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=312.8s)]
*  that it would be doable to reach this commitment of 5% today? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=317.2s)]
*  The secretary general of NATO, Mark Rutte, is working to appease President Trump as they [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=322.12s)]
*  meet this morning at the group's annual meeting. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump has long ceded doubt about his commitment to the transatlantic military alliance, and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=330.36s)]
*  ahead of the summit, Rutte sent him a series of fawning text messages praising his leadership [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=334.68s)]
*  that Trump then shared on social media. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=339.52s)]
*  The NATO leader has also been trying to get member countries on board with Trump's long-standing [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  demand that they raise military spending to 5% of their GDP, up from 2%. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=346.48s)]
*  Rutte suggested that could happen soon. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=352.48s)]
*  And notably, discussions of the war in Ukraine, which have dominated other NATO summits, are [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  expected to be sidelined in an effort to avoid any tensions with Trump, who has questioned [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=359.8s)]
*  America's support for the country. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=364.56s)]
*  Trump is attending meetings this morning, followed by a press conference before flying [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=367.08s)]
*  back to Washington. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=370.8s)]
*  He's expected to spend a total of less than 24 hours on the ground. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  Buyer be aware. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  On Tuesday, FICO, one of the leading credit score companies in the U.S., announced it's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=383.2s)]
*  going to start incorporating a new metric into its scores. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=387.96s)]
*  Payment history from when consumers sign up for buy now, pay later plans, which currently [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=391.9s)]
*  don't show up on credit reports. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  The move could eventually affect millions of Americans, since FICO's scores are used [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=398.44s)]
*  by 90% of lenders in the U.S. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=402.58s)]
*  And it comes as buy now, pay later has become an increasingly popular way to shop, not just [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  for big ticket items like couches or TVs, but for everyday expenses like groceries and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  household utilities. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  In 2019, Americans purchased about $2 billion in goods and services using pay later loans. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=417.16s)]
*  By 2023, that number shot up to over $100 billion. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=423.44s)]
*  One financial analyst told the Times that while the new calculations could hurt people [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=428.2s)]
*  who don't pay off their debt, it could also potentially give people who use the loans [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=432.44s)]
*  responsibly a way to boost their credit score. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  And finally, this week, the Times is wading into a dangerously controversial debate. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=439.32s)]
*  What are the 100 best films of the 21st century? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=450.92s)]
*  Okay, so what's it going to be? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=454.12s)]
*  My colleagues have compiled that list by polling more than 500 filmmakers, stars, and other [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=456.2s)]
*  Hollywood insiders. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=461.12s)]
*  This week, they're unveiling 20 films each day, starting at number 100, the 2007 comedy [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=462.84s)]
*  Superbad. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=468.8s)]
*  I am micklevin. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=469.8s)]
*  What kind of a stupid name is that, Fogel? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=470.8s)]
*  What, are you trying to be an Irish R&B singer? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=473.0s)]
*  Oscar winner Julianne Moore, among others, put that film in her top 10 list. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=475.12s)]
*  Directors Pedro Almodovar, Sofia Coppola, and Barry Jenkins also weighed in, as well [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=480.0s)]
*  as actors like Brian Cox and John Turturro. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=484.68s)]
*  The first 60 films have included everything from Gladiator. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=487.76s)]
*  Are you not entertained? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  Are you not entertained? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  Inside Llewyn Davis. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=496.0s)]
*  To the South Korean crime thriller, Old Boy. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  In his ballot, Turturro praised that film, saying, quote, it's romantic, it's disgusting, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=507.23999999999995s)]
*  it's fun, it just grabs you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptU2upu9bHY&t=512.8399999999999s)]
