# Midnight Deadline for Federal Workers, and Anti-Trump Protests Across U.S.
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, February [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=0.0s)]
*  6th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=7.44s)]
*  The clock is ticking for federal workers as they face a deadline of midnight tonight to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=13.92s)]
*  decide whether or not to take a payout offer and quit their government jobs. Last week, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=18.82s)]
*  the Trump administration gave roughly 2 million employees a choice. Leave their posts and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  get paid through the end of September or stay on and face potentially drastic downsizing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=29.24s)]
*  as well as demands for loyalty. It's part of a push by President Trump and Elon Musk [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=34.92s)]
*  to aggressively overhaul the federal government and slash billions in spending. So far, the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=41.16s)]
*  administration says tens of thousands of workers have agreed to leave their roles, even as [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  unions representing government employees are warning against it. There are concerns that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=52.4s)]
*  the deal might not be legal and that the administration might not follow through on [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=57.64s)]
*  its promise to keep paying people since funding for the plan hasn't been approved by Congress. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=61.64s)]
*  Other federal workers tell the Times they're angry and disgusted at the effort to force [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=67.44s)]
*  them out of their careers. One said, quote, This is an unreasonable situation with unreasonable [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=71.84s)]
*  people. The mass departures may affect federal agencies ranging from the CIA to the National [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=77.64s)]
*  Weather Service and disrupt a number of programs Americans rely on, from social security benefits [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=84.0s)]
*  to food safety inspections. The Times has learned that when President Trump laid out [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=89.92s)]
*  his brazen proposal to take over Gaza and relocate the 2 million people who live there, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=100.4s)]
*  he caught even his own staff by surprise. There had been no meetings about the plan [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  or even an outline of how it might work before he announced it. A number of reporters tried [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  to get details about this idea of his. When those details were not available, it became [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  clear that they didn't exist. My colleague Maggie Haberman covers the White House. She [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=121.88s)]
*  says the sudden unveiling of the controversial proposal, which could violate international [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=126.88s)]
*  law, lacked any specifics and immediately raised enormous questions. Where would Gazans [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=131.88s)]
*  go? What would it cost? Who would carry it out? And it left the White House scrambling [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=138.56s)]
*  to answer. So on Wednesday, some White House officials tried to, if not walk back, soften [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=143.16s)]
*  President Trump's statements. He did not rule out American troops in Gaza last night. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  Are you doing that now? I am saying that the president has not committed to that just yet. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  He has not made that commitment. And you know that Maggie says White House Press Secretary [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=159.12s)]
*  Caroline Levitt tried to clarify the plan, including saying that Palestinians would only [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  be relocated temporarily. Now, Levitt making the statement she did that seemed to soften [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=167.68s)]
*  Trump's earlier stance does not mean Trump himself is moving away from what he said. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  In fact, he may repeat it again. But what it is, is a cycle we have seen play out repeatedly [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=178.88s)]
*  where Trump says something and an aide tries to retrofit it to mean something slightly [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  different. Even some members of Trump's own party have been skeptical about his plan to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=190.16s)]
*  get involved in Gaza. Senator Lindsey Graham said, I think it might be problematic. And [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=194.84s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul said, I thought we voted for America first. Also on Wednesday, from [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=199.96s)]
*  now on, women's sports will be only for women. President Trump signed an executive order [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  aimed at banning transgender women and girls from competing in women's sports. The order [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=218.0s)]
*  directs federal agencies to pull funding from K through 12 schools and universities that don't [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=223.32s)]
*  comply. In recent years, the radical left has waged an all out campaign to erase the very concept [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=229.32s)]
*  of biological sex and replace it with a militant transgender ideology. You heard a little bit about [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=236.12s)]
*  this, haven't you? Just a little bit. Does anybody agree with them? A poll last month from the New [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=242.84s)]
*  York Times and Ipsos showed there's public support for the move. Over 90% of Republicans said [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=250.36s)]
*  transgender women shouldn't be allowed to compete in women's sports. 67% of Democrats agreed. But [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=257.08000000000004s)]
*  the new order has been denounced by multiple civil rights groups. The executive of one organization [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=264.68s)]
*  told the Times it, quote, segregates a group of young children, bars them from something that all [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=269.72s)]
*  other kids get to do. The order is Trump's latest targeting transgender Americans. He previously [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=275.4s)]
*  ordered a crackdown on gender transition care for minors and moved to push transgender people out of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=281.71999999999997s)]
*  the military. Meanwhile, thousands gathered across the country yesterday to protest President Trump [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=287.23999999999995s)]
*  and the sweeping changes he's pushed through so far. It was part of a grassroots effort called [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=302.76s)]
*  50 51. The goal was 50 protests in 50 states all on one day. People chanted, waved flags and spoke [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=312.2s)]
*  out against Trump's attack on the federal government and in support of immigrants and transgender [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  rights. Many in the crowds vowed to keep the pressure on. Every single thing has bothered me [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=326.28s)]
*  to the point where now it's just like it's just so out of control is that what are you supposed to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=331.8s)]
*  do? You have to come out and you have to get involved. Overall, the backlash to Trump's second [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=335.72s)]
*  term has been more muted than his first. In 2017, far more people, hundreds of thousands, marched in [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=340.76s)]
*  Washington, D.C. just a day after his inauguration. A new report out this week argues that the effort [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  to cut air pollution is actually speeding up global warming. The finding might feel [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=359.96s)]
*  counterintuitive, but the theory goes like this. For more than a century, humans have been spewing [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=365.96s)]
*  greenhouse gases into the air, driving dramatic climate change. Those gases were often mixed with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  other particles, including sulfate, which is toxic, but also produced more clouds, covering more of the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  sky and shielding the planet from the heat of the sun. As more and more countries have moved to clean [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  up air pollution and sulfate, the shield effect has been going away. The study is by James Hansen, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=388.84s)]
*  one of the first scientists to raise the alarm about climate change. It comes as researchers [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=395.4s)]
*  have been somewhat stumped by just how fast the world is warming. The main explanation is carbon [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=400.44s)]
*  emissions, but temperatures are going up faster than those emissions alone can explain. Last [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=406.28s)]
*  month was the hottest January in recorded history. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  And finally, the Super Bowl is this weekend. Philadelphia Eagles are playing the Kansas City [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=424.2s)]
*  Chiefs. You can imagine the players, the coaches, the officials all gearing up. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=429.24s)]
*  One person deep in preparations who you might not imagine is the NFL's first ever fashion editor. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  Kyle Smith started the job last fall with the mandate to use fashion and style to reach new [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=440.76s)]
*  audiences for the NFL. It's an acknowledgement that athletes have become major style influencers. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=446.28s)]
*  Commentators now pay attention not just to what they do on the field, but to what they're wearing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=456.28s)]
*  before and after the games. Did you see the embroidery on that black jacket and then pairing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=459.96s)]
*  with black leather pants with white lace running up the side? Wow. He looked amazing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=464.92s)]
*  NFL players have been decked out in tailored suits, furs, high end labels and designer track [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=470.52000000000004s)]
*  suits. In his new job, Smith works with the players to showcase that personal style. This [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  year, the Super Bowl will even have a brand new red carpet segment before the game. One NFL player [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=481.72s)]
*  credited Smith with building a bridge between the worlds of fashion and football, which had [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=487.72s)]
*  previously seemed miles apart. He told the Times, it was a problem before if you were into anything [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=492.36s)]
*  but grass, football and dirt. It's finally normal for football players to like fashion. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, a look at how the Democratic Party is struggling [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=505.8s)]
*  to respond to Trump's avalanche of aggressive new policies. That's next in the New York Times [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=510.6s)]
*  audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdrAN5jHWPk&t=516.12s)]
