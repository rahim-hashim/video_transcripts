# Poll Finds Harris Rising, and Florida Braces for Hurricane Milton
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, October 8th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=8.44s)]
*  A new poll out this morning from the Times and Siena College shows Kamala Harris sitting [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=14.0s)]
*  at 49% with likely voters nationwide to Trump's 46, giving her a slim lead within the poll's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=19.48s)]
*  margin of error. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=27.44s)]
*  This is the first poll where we see Harris ahead nationally since she entered the race [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=28.76s)]
*  a couple of months ago. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=33.52s)]
*  And this is the first time that we see any Democrat, Biden or Harris, leading in the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=35.04s)]
*  presidential race nationally this year. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=39.24s)]
*  Ruth Agelnick conducts and analyzes polls for the Times. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=41.96s)]
*  We've seen some notable changes since our last national poll, particularly that Harris [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=45.64s)]
*  has sort of shored up support with older voters and made some small gains with Republicans. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=50.08s)]
*  But sort of most importantly, she has sort of taken the mantle. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=56.42s)]
*  She's edged Trump out as the change candidate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=60.82s)]
*  And we know that this is probably the most important metric. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=63.22s)]
*  This election, a lot of voters really want change this year. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=66.5s)]
*  And so Harris sort of taking the edge there really helps explain some of her growth right [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=69.06s)]
*  now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=73.54s)]
*  This poll does show a lot of signs of strength for Trump, though. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=74.86s)]
*  In particular, he's still favored on the economy, which is by far voters most important issue. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=77.94s)]
*  He also is doing fairly well with men who are important group for Trump's victory. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=83.58s)]
*  Right now, Kamala Harris is falling below where Biden was with men in 2020. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=88.84s)]
*  And one sort of valuable metric that we've been tracking this whole election cycle is [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=94.22s)]
*  whether voters feel like Trump's policies helped them or hurt them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  And right now, more voters say that Trump's policies were helpful to them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=102.74s)]
*  And that's pretty consistent across demographic groups. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=106.08s)]
*  So Trump still continues to show strength there. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=108.74s)]
*  Overall, Ruth says the latest numbers offer a look at how voters are feeling right now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=112.7s)]
*  But they don't necessarily indicate how the electoral college numbers will shake out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=118.38s)]
*  That will be determined by the battleground states, including Georgia, Pennsylvania and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=123.9s)]
*  Wisconsin, where the polls have been exceedingly close. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=127.78s)]
*  On Monday afternoon, I drove to the Tampa Bay area while everybody else was driving [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=132.66s)]
*  away from it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=143.5s)]
*  You could see the traffic on the highway from people leaving not only Tampa, but places [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=144.94s)]
*  to the south ahead of Hurricane Milton. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=151.12s)]
*  Times reporter Patricia Mazzei is on Florida's Gulf Coast, where residents are bracing for [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=154.62s)]
*  the effects of Milton, which the National Hurricane Center called a potentially catastrophic [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=159.22s)]
*  category five. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=164.54s)]
*  Every time I drove into a new county, my cell phone would start blaring emergency alerts, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=166.34s)]
*  storm surge warning, hurricane warning, storm surge warning, hurricane warning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=172.82s)]
*  Milton is currently on track to make landfall in Florida tomorrow night, squarely in the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=177.9s)]
*  Tampa Bay region, which hasn't taken a direct hit in more than a century. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=182.38s)]
*  Residents in the region are urging residents to evacuate from the vulnerable, low-lying [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=187.46s)]
*  areas there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=191.34s)]
*  This is a state that just went through Hurricane Helene two weeks ago, a category four storm, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  and has had strong storms in the past few years where residents are just exhausted and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=198.34s)]
*  worried and anxious and sick about having to think about evacuating again and where [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=204.46s)]
*  the storm might go and how everything is going to look like afterward. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  Even before Milton makes landfall, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has already been [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=213.82s)]
*  stretched thin, not just by Helene, but also by flooding, landslides, tornadoes, and wildfires [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=219.1s)]
*  this year. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  It currently has less than 10% of its personnel available to deploy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  Today, the Biden administration unveiled a landmark rule that will require lead drinking [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=231.82s)]
*  water pipes to be replaced nationwide over the next 10 years. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  The goal is to reduce a major source of lead poisoning in the U.S., which can cause irreversible [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=250.14s)]
*  damage to the nervous system and the brain, particularly in babies and children. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=255.2s)]
*  The rule comes a decade after the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, which brought [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=260.18s)]
*  the dangers of lead poisoning and the fragility of drinking water systems into glaring relief. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  Replacing all the pipes will be a colossal undertaking. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=271.82s)]
*  The EPA estimates that it will cost $20 to $30 billion, most of which will fall to utility [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=274.7s)]
*  companies and, by extension, partly to their customers, though there is federal money as [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=280.5s)]
*  well. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=284.98s)]
*  Notably, the rule doesn't require utilities to replace pipes on private property, like [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  those that go to a home. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=290.82s)]
*  And some environmental groups worry low-income homeowners won't be able to afford that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=292.88s)]
*  Research has shown low-income Black and Latino neighborhoods are more likely to receive contaminated [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  water through lead pipes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=303.46000000000004s)]
*  This morning, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over whether the Biden administration overstepped [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=310.26s)]
*  in regulating ghost guns. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=315.54s)]
*  Ghost guns are firearms that people assemble themselves from kits you can buy online. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=318.42s)]
*  Companies who sell them promise they're quick and easy to put together. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=323.06s)]
*  You could be at the firing range in an hour or two. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=326.42s)]
*  The key selling point for a lot of buyers was that ghost guns were effectively untraceable [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=329.70000000000005s)]
*  until 2022, when the ATF started requiring that they be marked with serial numbers and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=335.3s)]
*  that would-be buyers pass a background check. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=341.82000000000005s)]
*  Law enforcement says that before that change, the number of ghost guns used in serious crimes [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=345.42s)]
*  was rising, and minors and other people who aren't legally allowed to have guns were getting [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=350.42s)]
*  their hands on them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=355.06s)]
*  Since the regulation was put in place, though, the number of ghost guns that law enforcement [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=357.3s)]
*  recovered at crime scenes has fallen. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=361.58s)]
*  Local officials and gun control groups fear that overturning the ATF's restrictions could [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=364.54s)]
*  reverse that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  The challenge to the regulation is coming from a group of gun owners and guns rights [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=371.5s)]
*  groups who say the ATF doesn't have the power to put this kind of regulation in place, and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=375.58s)]
*  that regulating firearms is Congress's job, not the job of an administrative agency. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=381.98s)]
*  This will be one of the first cases of the Supreme Court's new term, which just started [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=389.62s)]
*  this week. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=393.52s)]
*  The justices are set to tackle the issue of not only ghost guns, but also transgender [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=394.7s)]
*  rights and potentially voting disputes that could decide the presidential election. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=399.18s)]
*  And finally, for decades, humans' life expectancy has been marching upward thanks to medical [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=411.7s)]
*  and technological advances like antibiotics and sanitation. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  And some scientists predicted it would just keep on going up. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=421.58s)]
*  But a new study suggests there's a limit to what's possible, and humans could be closing [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=425.94s)]
*  in on that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=430.73999999999995s)]
*  The study, published in the journal Nature Aging, looked at three decades of data from [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=431.73999999999995s)]
*  places where people typically live the longest, like Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Switzerland. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=436.65999999999997s)]
*  And they found that while average life expectancies went up, they're not going up as fast. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=442.7s)]
*  The research suggests that while modern medicine has helped more people regularly live to their [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=449.67999999999995s)]
*  70s, 80s, and 90s, getting the average age up beyond that will prove difficult. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=454.78s)]
*  A professor who led the study, S.J. Olshansky, said, quote, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=461.26s)]
*  We're basically suggesting that as long as we live now is about as long as we're going [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=465.26s)]
*  to live. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=469.85999999999996s)]
*  Olshansky knows that not everyone agrees. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=470.85999999999996s)]
*  One of his colleagues in the field has a bet going with him that a human being who is alive [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  today could live to 150. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=479.05999999999995s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=485.78s)]
*  Today on The Daily, how the trade deal between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, known as NAFTA, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=488.14s)]
*  transformed the U.S. economy and broke American politics. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=494.61999999999995s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=500.26s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=505.5s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBAD_Ys-JCo&t=506.5s)]
