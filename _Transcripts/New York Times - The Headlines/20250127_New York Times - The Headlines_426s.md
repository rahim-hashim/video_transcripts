# Gazans Trek Home, and Trump's Tariff Spat With Colombia
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=4.84s)]
*  Today's Monday, January 27th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=5.84s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=7.84s)]
*  In Gaza this morning, tens of thousands of Palestinians have set out on foot, walking [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=17.28s)]
*  back toward their homes in the northern part of the Strip. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=22.0s)]
*  They're walking along the coastal road, steps from the beach, with bags, mattresses, anything [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=25.16s)]
*  they can carry on their backs. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=30.04s)]
*  It's the first time in 16 months that Israel has allowed people to go back to the north [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  after forcing them to evacuate. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=37.32s)]
*  Their return was part of Israel's ongoing ceasefire deal with Hamas, but it wasn't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=39.72s)]
*  clear what actually happened. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=44.08s)]
*  The whole agreement nearly fell apart this weekend when Israel and Hamas both accused [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=45.94s)]
*  each other of reneging on it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=50.22s)]
*  The dispute centered on one hostage, Arbel Yehud, the last female civilian in captivity [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=52.24s)]
*  who's thought to be alive. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=57.52s)]
*  Hamas was expected to release her Saturday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=59.68s)]
*  Instead, they released four other hostages. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Israel, in response, held off on letting anyone go north. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  Just after midnight, they came to an agreement, though. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=69.4s)]
*  Yehud is expected to be released this week, and Israel's now allowing those who've been [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=71.76s)]
*  displaced to start the journey back. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=75.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Lebanon, Israel's truce with Hezbollah was also pushed to the limit this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=80.27999999999999s)]
*  weekend. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=85.47999999999999s)]
*  Israeli troops opened fire as thousands of displaced people there poured onto the roads [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  to try and return home. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=90.88s)]
*  The Israeli military said it was firing warning shots. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  At least 22 people were killed and more than 120 injured, according to Lebanon's health [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=95.88s)]
*  ministry. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=100.32s)]
*  Despite the flare-up in violence, the White House issued a statement saying the truce [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=101.72s)]
*  between Hezbollah and Israel will continue, though neither Israel nor Hezbollah have confirmed [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=105.32s)]
*  that publicly. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  President Trump and the president of Colombia got into a furious back-and-forth yesterday [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  as they clashed over deportation flights. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  Two U.S. military cargo planes carrying deported Colombians were in the air when Colombian [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=126.56s)]
*  officials refused to let them land, forcing the planes to turn around and fly back to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=131.52s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=136.16s)]
*  In a series of posts on social media, President Gustavo Petro said he would only accept deported [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=137.16s)]
*  Colombians if they were treated with dignity and respect, and said they should be transported [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=143.16000000000003s)]
*  on passenger jets, not military aircraft. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=147.88s)]
*  That kicked off what was basically an hours-long trade war with Trump and then Petro, both [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  announcing 25 percent tariffs on each other's countries. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=157.0s)]
*  Trump also announced financial sanctions and a travel ban on Colombian government officials. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=161.0s)]
*  By the end of the day, Colombia backed down and the White House took a victory lap, saying [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=166.36s)]
*  in a statement that it was, quote, clear to the world that America is respected again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=170.48s)]
*  The clash may serve as an example to other countries across South and Central America [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=175.68s)]
*  of the consequences they could face if they try to push back against Trump's deportation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=180.16s)]
*  plans. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=184.48s)]
*  Today marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp in Poland [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=191.0s)]
*  where more than a million people, mostly Jews, were killed during World War II. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=198.68s)]
*  Dozens of world leaders will attend the ceremony, which will take place near a former gas chamber. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=203.76s)]
*  And survivors of the camp will lay wreaths. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=209.08s)]
*  Fewer than 50 of them will be there today, a number that's shrinking each year. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=211.8s)]
*  My colleague Andrew Higgins is covering the ceremony. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=216.32s)]
*  He says the event comes as nationalism is rising across Europe. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=219.08s)]
*  And the most prominent example of that is Germany, where Alternative for Germany, a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=222.8s)]
*  party that sometimes echoes almost Nazi-era propaganda, is doing very well in the polls [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=228.52s)]
*  ahead of an election less than a month away now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=236.52s)]
*  Just this weekend, AFD held a rally in eastern Germany. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  Fight for a great future for Germany. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  Fight for a great future for Germany. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  Go, go, go. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  And Elon Musk spoke by video link and told Germans that they should not feel guilty for [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=248.96s)]
*  the Nazi-era crimes of their grandparents. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=254.28s)]
*  You know, I think there's like, frankly, too much of a focus on past guilt and we need [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=257.24s)]
*  to move beyond that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=261.84s)]
*  And this alarmed the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who said that this sounded all [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=263.64s)]
*  too familiar and ominous, especially only hours before the anniversary of the liberation [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=269.88s)]
*  of Auschwitz. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=274.48s)]
*  I think that, you know, the rise of extremism and extremist nationalist parties in Europe [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  is one of the reasons why there will be such a big turnout by world leaders today. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=281.04s)]
*  They're there because they want to show that in their view there should be no place in [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  Europe today for the rhetoric of extreme nationalism, which obviously is what led to Auschwitz in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  the 1940s. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=296.12s)]
*  In Southern California, a rainstorm finally broke the dry spell that had fueled the recent [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=306.92s)]
*  wildfires. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  But the National Weather Service is warning the rain could lead to significant mudslides, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  especially in areas scarred by the fires. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  The charred dirt essentially acts like slick pavement. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=321.76s)]
*  The rain just runs off of it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=324.76s)]
*  And the resulting rush of water can cut through the landscape, uprooting trees and dislodging [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=326.6s)]
*  anything else in its path. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=331.24s)]
*  There's a flood watch in effect in Los Angeles County until this afternoon. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=333.24s)]
*  And finally, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  Get your jerseys. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  Get your guacamole. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=350.16s)]
*  You can dislike the Chiefs! [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=351.16s)]
*  You can disrespect the Chiefs! [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=353.16s)]
*  You're going to have to deal with the Chiefs! [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=355.16s)]
*  This year's Super Bowl matchup is set. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  The Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=360.08s)]
*  The teams clinched their spots yesterday, setting up a repeat of the 2023 Super Bowl, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=363.8s)]
*  which Kansas City won. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=369.64s)]
*  If the Chiefs pull it off again, they will make NFL history, becoming the first team [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=371.8s)]
*  ever to win three straight Super Bowls. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=376.56s)]
*  But to do that, they will have to beat a team that breaks the mold of modern NFL strategy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=379.56s)]
*  Most teams rely on passing the ball to drive down the field and score. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=384.97999999999996s)]
*  The Eagles largely run it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=388.8s)]
*  The big game is in New Orleans this year on February 9th. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=391.36s)]
*  For people who don't care how they get the ball down the field, the halftime show is [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=394.36s)]
*  Kendrick Lamar. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=398.24s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=402.76s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at Stephen Miller, one of Trump's most influential advisors, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  and the man behind his hardline immigration policy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=409.8s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=413.08000000000004s)]
*  podcasts. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=416.04s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enxe2XSfTbU&t=418.28000000000003s)]
