# Supreme Court Clears Way for Deportations, and a Stock Market Fake-Out
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, April [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=0.0s)]
*  8th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=7.28s)]
*  The Supreme Court has issued two emergency rulings on the Trump administration's immigration [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  policies that, at least for now, are victories for President Trump. Last night, the court [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=18.96s)]
*  ruled the administration can continue deporting Venezuelan migrants that it's accused of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=24.72s)]
*  being violent gang members trying to invade the U.S. The administration has been citing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=29.82s)]
*  the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime power from the 1700s, in carrying out those deportations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=34.9s)]
*  The court didn't rule on whether that's constitutional or not. Instead, it made a more narrow ruling [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=41.82s)]
*  that lawyers for the Venezuelans had filed their challenge to the deportations in the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=47.22s)]
*  wrong court. The Supreme Court said that since the men had been held in Texas, the case should [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=51.3s)]
*  have started there and not in Washington, D.C. While the administration can now press [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=57.18s)]
*  forward with its deportation plans, all nine justices did agree that the government has [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=61.74s)]
*  to give the detainees advance notice that it plans to deport them and the opportunity [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=67.46s)]
*  to challenge that. Some of the migrants who've already been deported under the Alien Enemies [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=72.5s)]
*  Act have had little to no due process. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=77.22s)]
*  Also, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked a lower court's order [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=82.18s)]
*  that required the government to bring back a man it deported by mistake to El Salvador. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=87.82000000000001s)]
*  Roberts issued an administrative stay in the case until the justices have time to consider [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  it further. That's expected to happen in the next few days. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Times has learned that the Trump administration is gearing up for a massive [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=104.9s)]
*  expansion of its deportation efforts. ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=109.62s)]
*  asked contractors to submit proposals for detention facilities, transportation, security [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=115.26s)]
*  guards and other services and said the budget could be up to $45 billion for the next two [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=121.22s)]
*  years. By comparison, ICE spent about $3.5 billion on similar operations last fiscal [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=127.22s)]
*  year. The agency doesn't yet have the money that will need Congress for that, but the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=133.26s)]
*  call for proposals is the first concrete sign that it's preparing to quickly scale up detentions [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=138.02s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=143.3s)]
*  Monday was another brutal and chaotic day on the stock market as President Trump's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=154.3s)]
*  tariffs continue to rock the global economy. In a sign of just how volatile the markets [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=158.94s)]
*  are, reports that Trump was considering pausing the tariffs sent stocks shooting up. Investors [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=164.18s)]
*  let out a sigh of relief. Then it turned out the reports were false and stocks fell back [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=170.34s)]
*  down. And governments around the world are just as on edge as investors. They've been [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=174.78s)]
*  racing to schedule phone calls with the White House or send delegations in the hopes they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=179.78s)]
*  can negotiate on the tariffs, even as the president has said the surcharges are here [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=184.34s)]
*  to stay. Yesterday at the White House, reporters pressed Trump on the issue. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=188.7s)]
*  What is the actual reason that Trump is saying that tariffs are permanent? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=194.1s)]
*  What he's been saying when people call him, as happened over the weekend, I've spoken [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  to a few people who spoke to him privately over the weekend, is in these conversations [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=214.06s)]
*  he's boasting. He's saying, everyone's calling me, they're all kissing my ass, they all want [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=217.9s)]
*  to do deals, they're begging me. He's in that kind of a mode. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=223.4s)]
*  My colleague Jonathan Swan is on today's episode of The Daily with an inside look at how the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=228.28s)]
*  White House has been rolling out the tariffs and if Trump is serious about keeping them [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=233.12s)]
*  in place or if they're a high stakes negotiating tactic. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=237.6s)]
*  You ask that question of people around him and they say, well, no, not really. He might [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=241.96s)]
*  do some deals, but actually, no, he's really quite set on this idea of eliminating trade [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  deficits and building things here in America. You have these two things running into each [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  other. One problem that some of his advisors have, I would say most of his advisors have, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=257.92s)]
*  if they're being honest, is get criticized a lot for, well, your messaging is so all [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=262.96s)]
*  over the place. It's like, yeah, no kidding, because the man in charge- [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=268.68s)]
*  His messaging is all over the place. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=272.52s)]
*  Yeah, from one minute to the other. He's in deal making mode and then he's in, no, this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=273.96s)]
*  is an economic revolution and you need to hang tough. You're getting these competing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=278.36s)]
*  messages. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, three quick updates from the Trump administration. First. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  Fluoride should not be in our water. It makes no sense to have in our water supply. I'm [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=292.64s)]
*  very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  will come. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called on states to ban the practice of adding fluoride [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=305.44s)]
*  to drinking water, a move that could undercut decades of public health efforts to prevent [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=311.2s)]
*  tooth decay. He made the remarks in Utah, where a statewide ban on fluoride kicks in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=316.0s)]
*  next month. While some studies have found that fluoride in very high doses can have [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=321.32s)]
*  negative health effects, dentists and many medical experts say that the amount being [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=326.52s)]
*  added to drinking water is safe and essential for protecting oral health. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=331.36s)]
*  Also, the Times has learned that Attorney General Pam Bondi wants to roll back a number [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=337.56s)]
*  of gun control measures, reversing actions that the Biden administration put in place. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=342.52s)]
*  She's expected to eliminate a zero tolerance policy that strips licenses from gun dealers [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  who are found to have skipped background checks or falsified records. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=352.88s)]
*  And she's looking to scrap other policies, including one that requires background checks [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=356.32s)]
*  for private gun sales. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=360.84s)]
*  And. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  We're having direct talks with Iran and they've started. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=364.64s)]
*  It'll go on Saturday. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=370.11999999999995s)]
*  We have a very big meeting and we'll see what can happen. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=371.67999999999995s)]
*  President Trump said the U.S. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=375.0s)]
*  will begin negotiations with Iran this weekend in hopes of reining in the country's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=376.56s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=381.28s)]
*  It's a major reversal for Trump, who pulled the U.S. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=382.88s)]
*  out of the last nuclear agreement with Iran during his first term. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  Since then, Iran has built up its capabilities and now has enough fuel to quickly build a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=390.0s)]
*  half dozen nuclear weapons. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=395.2s)]
*  Iranian officials told the Times the talks will only begin with intermediaries, but that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=397.47999999999996s)]
*  the countries could engage directly if the initial meetings go well. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=402.52s)]
*  Trump threatened that if the two sides don't reach an agreement, Iran would be in, quote, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=406.76s)]
*  great danger. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=411.55999999999995s)]
*  And finally, scientists have brought back the ancient extinct dire wolf or something [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  close to it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=426.47999999999996s)]
*  If you thought dire wolves were only a thing from the fantasy series Game of Thrones, you [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=427.76s)]
*  are not alone. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=432.08s)]
*  They've been gone for over 13,000 years, but they used to dominate southern Canada and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=433.35999999999996s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=438.55999999999995s)]
*  They're bigger than gray wolves with massive teeth and they have thick white fur. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=439.55999999999995s)]
*  Researchers were able to retrieve DNA from some dire wolf fossils a few years ago. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=444.32s)]
*  And another group of scientists says it edited the genes of other wolves to match those. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=449.44s)]
*  They then created embryos from the edited genes. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  And there you go. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=457.28s)]
*  Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi were born. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=458.28s)]
*  The pups appear to have some traits of the dire wolf. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=461.11999999999995s)]
*  The company behind the experiment has worked on trying to bring back other ancient or lost [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  species, too, like the woolly mammoth and the dodo bird. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=468.88s)]
*  But some hope this kind of research could also be used with animals that aren't totally [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=472.79999999999995s)]
*  gone yet by helping boost the population of species on the verge of extinction. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=477.24s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=486.08s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfFv8plHJww&t=488.32s)]
