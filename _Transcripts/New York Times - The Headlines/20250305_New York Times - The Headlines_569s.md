# Trump’s Defiant Victory Lap, and the Dept. of Education’s ‘Final Mission’
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=4.88s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, March 5th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=7.76s)]
*  My fellow citizens, America is back. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=14.08s)]
*  Last night, President Trump delivered a forceful primetime address to Congress. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=20.84s)]
*  It was the longest speech of its kind in modern presidential history. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=24.84s)]
*  Over the course of an hour and 40 minutes, Trump went on a kind of defiant victory lap, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=29.48s)]
*  celebrating the blitz of drastic changes he's made to domestic and foreign policy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=34.6s)]
*  My colleague Jonathan Swan was covering the speech. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=39.84s)]
*  It was contentious from the very beginning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=42.64s)]
*  We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=44.84s)]
*  Early in the speech, Democratic Representative Al Green of Texas stood up and started heckling [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=57.88s)]
*  He was waving his cane in the air. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=59.0s)]
*  Mr. Green, take your seat. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  Take your seat, sir. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=64.16s)]
*  And after multiple warnings from the speaker to be quiet, to respect the quorum, he just [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  refused to sit down. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=72.12s)]
*  He continued yelling. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=73.44s)]
*  Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=74.44s)]
*  And he was escorted out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=77.64s)]
*  Trump seemed to almost be energized by the Democratic opposition, and he goaded Democrats [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=81.28s)]
*  throughout the night. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=88.48s)]
*  For just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  When he got to the substance of the speech, it was really similar to what we've heard [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=96.92s)]
*  him talk about thematically for really the last nine years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=101.48s)]
*  He focused on illegal immigration and his efforts to crack down on the border. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  He leaned into cultural issues like transgender issues and talked about law and order. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=111.56s)]
*  The other thing that Trump really sort of called out in the speech was Doge. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=118.92s)]
*  Perhaps you've heard of it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=122.96s)]
*  Perhaps. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=125.8s)]
*  And Elon Musk, who stood and received applause. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=126.8s)]
*  Thank you, Elon. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=130.0s)]
*  He's working very hard. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=131.0s)]
*  Trump spent a lot of time reciting different line items that they claim they have stopped [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=133.0s)]
*  and payments in the budget that he says are fraudulent and praised Elon Musk's work. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=139.92s)]
*  Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  believe in and for the country our people deserve. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  The impression you got from watching the speech was this is a president who, despite everything [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=155.6s)]
*  so far, all of the protests, the market, stock market reaction to what he's doing with tariffs, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=161.68s)]
*  to outrage from Democrats. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=169.08s)]
*  This is a president who is not taking any steps backwards. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=170.68s)]
*  He is barreling forward with his agenda. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=174.72s)]
*  He's doing it unapologetically and he shows no sign so far of retreating from any of these [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=177.44s)]
*  very aggressive moves that he's taken so far. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=183.62s)]
*  So I promise to be a lot shorter than what you just watched. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=190.72000000000003s)]
*  After President Trump spoke, Democratic Senator Alyssa Slotkin of Michigan delivered the traditional [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=193.88000000000002s)]
*  rebuttal speech from the opposing party. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  She tried to make her case to both Democrats and Republicans. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=201.88s)]
*  We need a more efficient government. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=205.92s)]
*  You want to cut waste, I'll help you do it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=207.76s)]
*  But change doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=210.32s)]
*  Slotkin specifically narrowed in on economics, arguing that the president's agenda will [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=213.84s)]
*  make life more expensive for Americans, affecting everything from grocery prices to retirement [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=218.48s)]
*  benefits. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=224.04s)]
*  She said, quote, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=225.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers got a warning from the party's leadership about how to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=230.96s)]
*  handle growing pushback to Trump's policies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=235.56s)]
*  The chairman of the House Republicans campaign arm told them to stop having in-person town [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=238.96s)]
*  halls. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=244.88s)]
*  The directive came after Republicans' meetings with their constituents across the country [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=245.88s)]
*  have turned into shouting matches, with attendees confronting representatives about government [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=250.52s)]
*  spending cuts and mass firings. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=255.36s)]
*  The chairman said Democratic activists have been taking over the town halls and encouraged [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=258.32s)]
*  Republicans to hold online events instead. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=263.48s)]
*  Here are two other quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=270.36s)]
*  So I think he's going to work something out with them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=274.52s)]
*  It's not going to be a pause. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=276.56s)]
*  And that pause stuff. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=278.04s)]
*  But I think he's going to figure out you do more and I'll meet you in the middle some [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=279.6s)]
*  way. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that the U.S. could soon reach some kind of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  agreement with Canada and Mexico over Trump's drastic new tariffs. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=289.04s)]
*  The 25 percent surcharges went into effect yesterday. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  The stock market plunged in response. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=297.68s)]
*  Lutnick said on Fox Business that he'd been speaking with representatives from Canada [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  and Mexico and that there could be an announcement as soon as today. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=304.24s)]
*  But it didn't say what concessions, if any, the countries would have to make to get the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=307.68s)]
*  tariffs rolled back. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  And at the Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon sent out her first email to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=314.68s)]
*  staff after being confirmed, and it seemed to signal what could be an end to the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=319.64s)]
*  department altogether. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=324.44s)]
*  Trump has repeatedly said he wants to shut the Department of Education down. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=326.32s)]
*  And the subject line of McMahon's email was, our department's final mission. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=330.64s)]
*  She promised she would work to, quote, restore oversight of education to the state [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=336.0s)]
*  level and said that would mean significant changes for the department's staff, budget [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=340.67999999999995s)]
*  and operations. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=345.52s)]
*  In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky outlined what he said could be the first steps [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=355.2s)]
*  toward peace if Russia is on board. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=359.96s)]
*  He said he's prepared to release prisoners of war, stop long range strikes and declare [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=363.0s)]
*  a truce at sea immediately if Russia does the same. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=368.08s)]
*  He made the offer after President Trump froze all U.S. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=372.32s)]
*  military aid to Ukraine, following their clash at the White House. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=375.72s)]
*  Trump has said he didn't think Zelensky was thankful enough to the U.S. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=379.84s)]
*  or serious about a peace deal. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=382.92s)]
*  Zelensky delivered his plan in conciliatory language. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=385.12s)]
*  He wrote, quote, My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=388.56s)]
*  leadership to get a peace that lasts. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=392.92s)]
*  This week, seven Tesla charging stations were set on fire at a shopping center outside [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=401.56s)]
*  Boston. It's the latest in a series of attacks against the electric car company since [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=406.52s)]
*  its owner, Elon Musk, started advising President Trump and carrying out his cost [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=411.92s)]
*  cutting agenda. Tesla showrooms and dealerships across the country have been targeted [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=416.44s)]
*  with protests and vandalism. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=421.64s)]
*  This week, federal prosecutors charged a woman in Colorado with planting an incendiary [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  device near a Tesla. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  And in Europe, Tesla sales are dropping. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  In February, they were down more than 40 percent compared to the same time last year [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  in Norway, Denmark and Sweden. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=438.52s)]
*  Some of the decline may be explained by customers waiting for Tesla to release an updated [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=441.0s)]
*  model, which is coming out soon. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=445.44s)]
*  But that factor alone likely doesn't cover it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=447.48s)]
*  Data out this morning shows that Tesla's February sales plunged 76 percent in Germany, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=450.44s)]
*  where Musk's recent support of the country's far right party may have alienated buyers. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  And finally, do you think what you paid for the ticket is worth it? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=467.4s)]
*  I mean, it's Beyonce. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=473.0s)]
*  Yeah, fair. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=474.28s)]
*  The price of concert tickets has been soaring. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  People have been emptying out their bank accounts, especially to see big name artists [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=479.12s)]
*  like Beyonce, Bad Bunny, Charlie XCX. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=483.12s)]
*  The Times has been talking with young people about how it's hitting them particularly [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  hard. Have you ever gone into debt paying for a ticket? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=490.88s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  Gen Z. So those roughly in their mid teens to mid 20s now are paying much more for [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOrvDBZtWi0&t=497.48s)]
