# Trump’s Drastic Tariff Turnaround, and Green Card Holders on Edge
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Thursday, April 10th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  You walk us through why you decided to put a 90-day pause. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=10.52s)]
*  Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=17.72s)]
*  They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=22.32s)]
*  In an abrupt turnaround yesterday, President Trump announced that he was pausing most of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=27.8s)]
*  the massive global tariffs he'd put in place just hours after they kicked in. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=32.4s)]
*  Yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=36.96s)]
*  He acknowledged that his plan had sparked economic chaos. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=40.36s)]
*  Behind the scenes at the White House, his advisors had been increasingly worried that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=43.92s)]
*  the plunging stock market and government bond sell-off could spiral into a full-blown recession. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=48.08s)]
*  Ultimately, his decision to reverse course after days of repeatedly saying he wouldn't [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=54.24s)]
*  was so sudden that some of his top aides didn't even find out about it until Trump posted [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=59.52s)]
*  the announcement on social media. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=63.92s)]
*  The president said that now he is ready to negotiate. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=65.64s)]
*  The deal's going to be made with every one of them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  And they'll be fair deals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=71.72s)]
*  I just want fair. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=72.84s)]
*  For the time being, basically all of America's trading partners will face an across-the-board [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=74.44s)]
*  10 percent tariff that Trump previously put in place. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=79.4s)]
*  But anything higher than that is on hold for 90 days to allow time for negotiations and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  to allow companies to ask for exemptions from the tariffs. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  When reporters asked the president how he's going to move forward on all of that, Trump [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=92.44000000000001s)]
*  suggested he'd be going off his gut and making the decisions instinctively. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you almost can't take a pencil to paper. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  It's really more of an instinct, I think, than anything else. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=104.48s)]
*  The stock market obviously liked President Trump's reversal on tariffs. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=109.64s)]
*  The S&P 500 was up 9.5 percent. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=114.64s)]
*  That's the best day of trading since 2008. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=117.92s)]
*  But I'm not sure that this does anything much to ease the economic concerns that have been [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=122.1s)]
*  brewing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=129.4s)]
*  And it's possible it could even make them worse. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=130.4s)]
*  Ben Castleman is an economics reporter at The Times. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=133.8s)]
*  For one thing, the reversal just reinforces this feeling of uncertainty and chaos and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=136.76s)]
*  a sense that businesses and consumers just have no idea what the rules of the game are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=145.06s)]
*  going to be from one day to the next. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  And importantly, President Trump actually increased tariffs on China, even as he delayed [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=154.7s)]
*  implementation of tariffs on other trading partners. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=160.7s)]
*  And China, of course, is a huge U.S. trading partner. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=164.26s)]
*  And it increasingly looks like we're headed for just an all-out trade war with China. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=167.88s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Times White House reporter Jonathan Swan on how far Trump might go in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=176.38s)]
*  his economic standoff with China. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=181.94s)]
*  My sense is quite far. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=184.45999999999998s)]
*  And he won't want to be the one to back down first. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  He can't be happy about this, having to blink and having to put the pause on all of this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=189.18s)]
*  So for him, China will assume even more importance. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=193.52s)]
*  On Capitol Hill, House Republicans are having trouble getting the votes they need for their [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=204.52s)]
*  budget plan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=208.88s)]
*  The House was supposed to vote yesterday on a spending blueprint that President Trump [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  has been pushing them hard to pass. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=214.56s)]
*  We got to get this big, beautiful deal done. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=216.96s)]
*  We got to get it done. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=219.72s)]
*  But a small, hard-right group of holdouts within the Republican Party could not be swayed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=221.24s)]
*  They say they're concerned about the country's growing deficit and they want more spending [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  cuts. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=231.28s)]
*  They say they're necessary to offset all the tax cuts that the plan includes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=232.28s)]
*  A couple of people want to show, I got to get a little bit more, a little bit more. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  You know what you're going to get? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  You end up getting nothing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  You end up getting a Democrat bill or worse. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  In a room off the House floor yesterday, House Speaker Mike Johnson gathered the GOP defectors [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  for over an hour to try and convince them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=250.4s)]
*  But they didn't blink. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  We have a small subset of members who weren't totally satisfied with the product of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=254.48s)]
*  stance that we're going to... [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=259.24s)]
*  Without enough support to move forward, given the GOP's razor-thin margin in the House, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=260.24s)]
*  Johnson delayed the vote but insisted they will get the plan passed. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=265.96s)]
*  This Republican conference has demonstrated over and over this majority that we deliver [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  when the time comes and we are going to deliver this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=274.32s)]
*  So just stay tuned. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=276.44s)]
*  Johnson said they may try again as soon as today. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=278.88s)]
*  On the immigration front, the Trump administration's aggressive crackdown and promise of mass deportations [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=285.48s)]
*  has been reaching some U.S. residents who never expected to be targeted. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=291.5s)]
*  Green card holders. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  More than 10 million people have green cards, which allow them to live and work in the U.S. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=297.76s)]
*  permanently. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=302.76s)]
*  But the Times has been tracking how some of them are now facing deportation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=303.76s)]
*  Alex and his wife Anita were returning from a vacation to El Salvador to visit her family. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  It was the day after Trump had taken office and his record popped up in the system. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=314.88s)]
*  My colleague Miriam Jordan is following the story of Alex Oriana, who's lived in the U.S. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=321.2s)]
*  since he was four. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  When Oriana re-entered the country after his trip, border officers flagged an almost decade-old [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=327.4s)]
*  conviction that he had for trying to swindle a store out of $200. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=332.46s)]
*  While green card holders can be deported for criminal offenses, that kind of low-level [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=336.88s)]
*  crime typically wouldn't have caused any issues. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=341.32s)]
*  But this time, Oriana ended up getting taken into custody and locked up at an immigration [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=344.08s)]
*  facility in Texas, where he's facing deportation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  Miriam says that his unexpected detention has shaken the family. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=352.04s)]
*  He and his wife are expecting a baby in July. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=355.94s)]
*  For the moment, they've canceled the baby shower. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=358.32s)]
*  This case and others I've learned about show that the administration has expanded its enforcement [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=361.36s)]
*  to people in the country lawfully. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=368.06s)]
*  That's a universe of millions more immigrants who are suddenly worried. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=371.16s)]
*  Because green card holders normally assume that it's just like one step from being a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=376.54s)]
*  citizen. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=382.8s)]
*  But now they're realizing that without citizenship, you're still vulnerable. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=384.42s)]
*  Around the country, there's a growing battle around the use of cameras in senior care facilities. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=399.44s)]
*  In recent years, more and more families have been installing cameras in their loved ones' [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=404.72s)]
*  rooms, both to check in on them and to look out for abuse or neglect. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=408.76s)]
*  In a high-profile case in Minnesota, one family secretly installed a camera in their [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=413.62s)]
*  mother's apartment at an assisted living facility. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=418.0s)]
*  On the footage, they saw that staff were repeatedly ignoring her and then berating her. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=420.94s)]
*  The family went on to push lawmakers to pass one of the country's first laws protecting [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=426.9s)]
*  families' rights to install cameras like they did. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=431.64s)]
*  At least 17 other states have now passed similar laws. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=435.02s)]
*  But many facilities and industry groups have been pushing back. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=438.74s)]
*  They've called the cameras an invasion of privacy for staff and residents. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=442.22s)]
*  One elder care expert told the Times the surveillance can also have the effect of unfairly treating [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=446.92s)]
*  the staff as suspects. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=451.56s)]
*  Overall, experts say that cameras can only catch problems with care, not fix them in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  the first place, and that taking care of the country's rapidly aging population will [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=458.98s)]
*  require increased staffing, better training, and more oversight of the facilities in general. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=473.22s)]
*  of all the songs [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=480.22s)]
*  and ballads [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=484.22s)]
*  ever recorded, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=489.22s)]
*  which ones will be officially preserved for the future? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=494.22s)]
*  This week, the Library of Congress announced its newest picks for the National Recording [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=498.22s)]
*  Registry, which archives art that it says is culturally, historically, or aesthetically [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=503.22s)]
*  significant. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=508.22s)]
*  Among this year's entries, there's everything from Roy Rogers to Elton John to Celine Dion [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=509.22s)]
*  to Mary J. Blige. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=514.22s)]
*  The oldest pick this year was the 1913 Hawaiian song, Aloha Ooi. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=518.22s)]
*  The most recent is the original Broadway cast recording of Hamilton. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTB4ucgrTY&t=523.22s)]
