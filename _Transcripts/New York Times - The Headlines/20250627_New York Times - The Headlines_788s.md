# The G.O.P. Scramble Over Trump’s Policy Bill, and Tracking Major Supreme Court Rulings
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Will Jarvis. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Friday, June 27th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=8.4s)]
*  Thank you all for being here to support one of the most important pieces of legislation [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=13.64s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=18.98s)]
*  President Trump is trying to rally support for his sprawling domestic policy agenda, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=21.02s)]
*  even as Republicans on Capitol Hill are scrambling to salvage some of its key provisions. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=25.66s)]
*  As drafted, the so-called Big Beautiful Bill would extend tax cuts from President Trump's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=35.78s)]
*  first term and make deep reductions to public services like food benefits and health care, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=40.84s)]
*  among many other policy changes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=46.06s)]
*  The House signed off on its version of the legislation last month. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  Now it's in the Senate's hands, and the president has given GOP lawmakers a July 4th deadline [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=51.94s)]
*  to pass it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=56.94s)]
*  We are in potentially the messiest possible place that this bill could be in right now [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=57.94s)]
*  in the Senate. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=63.48s)]
*  Most of the major elements of this legislation, the cuts to food assistance programs, the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=64.96s)]
*  cuts to Medicaid, they're still up in the air right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=70.08s)]
*  My colleague Katie Edmondson covers Congress. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=73.9s)]
*  She says that the bill has hit major roadblocks, in part because of the wonky process the GOP [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=76.32s)]
*  is using to avoid a Democratic filibuster and get it to the president's desk. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=81.22s)]
*  It means that before the Senate can pass the bill, the parliamentarian who enforces the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=85.66s)]
*  chamber's rules has to confirm that the policies in it meet certain budget requirements. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=89.74s)]
*  She's already found that a number of them don't. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=95.02s)]
*  The Senate parliamentarian, in fact, has told Republicans that they need to either revise [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=97.58s)]
*  several major elements of the legislation or that they need to discard them from the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=102.38s)]
*  bill entirely. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=107.82s)]
*  That includes some of the cuts to Medicaid. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=110.08s)]
*  Right now, Senate Republicans are looking to try to make edits to some of those provisions [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=112.08s)]
*  to be able to include them in this legislation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=117.0s)]
*  At the same time, a trend that we've been seeing play out across the nation really is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=120.36s)]
*  that a number of these Republican senators have been hearing from constituents who are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=124.32s)]
*  deeply concerned about the impact that some of these cuts to popular programs like Medicaid, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=128.96s)]
*  like SNAP or food stamps might have. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=135.2s)]
*  They have a very short amount of time to figure it out in. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=137.88s)]
*  But I do think the bottom line here is that they are feeling enormous pressure to deliver, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=141.26s)]
*  to deliver the tax cuts that President Trump has promised. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=146.34s)]
*  The prevailing wisdom here on the Hill is that they are going to be able to pass something [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  and soon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=153.82s)]
*  Katie says that party leaders hope to vote on the bill as soon as this weekend. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=157.66s)]
*  The Senate Majority Leader, John Thune, said there were what he called speed bumps along [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  the way, but that, quote, we're moving forward. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=165.52s)]
*  Now, three more updates on the Trump administration. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=175.32s)]
*  So we have five yes votes, one no vote and one abstain. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=178.32s)]
*  Yesterday, a federal vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=183.72s)]
*  Jr. voted to walk back its longstanding recommendation for a flu vaccine that contains an ingredient [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=188.96s)]
*  the anti-vax movement has falsely linked to autism. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=195.36s)]
*  Dozens of studies have shown the chemical thimerosal, which is used in only a small [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=199.10000000000002s)]
*  subset of vaccines, to be harmless. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=203.14000000000001s)]
*  But the group voted against recommending it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=205.86s)]
*  The vote signaled a significant shift in how the government approaches vaccines as it starts [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  to act on Kennedy's skepticism about their safety. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=213.06s)]
*  He had previously fired all 17 members of the panel and named eight new ones, half of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  whom have publicly questioned vaccines. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  Also, the Times has learned about a new front in the Trump administration's crackdown on [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  American universities. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=229.28s)]
*  The Justice Department has privately demanded that the University of Virginia oust its president [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  over his handling of the school's diversity, equity and inclusion programs. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=236.44000000000003s)]
*  It's accused the president, James E. Ryan, of failing to dismantle the DEI programs, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  which President Trump has aggressively targeted. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=246.36s)]
*  And DOJ officials have told the university that it could lose hundreds of millions of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  dollars in federal funding if Ryan is not removed. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=252.86s)]
*  Legal experts told the Times that this kind of pressure on a state university is extremely [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=256.62s)]
*  rare. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=261.58s)]
*  One said it's a tactic you'd normally expect to see when the government is playing hardball [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=262.74s)]
*  in a case with, quote, pervasive criminal activity. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  And the State Department says it has approved $30 million in funding for a contentious aid [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=273.7s)]
*  group in Gaza. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=279.42s)]
*  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is run mostly by American contractors and is backed by Israel, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=281.06s)]
*  with Israeli troops guarding its aid distribution sites. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=286.72s)]
*  But the aid plan has come under heavy criticism for putting Gazans in danger, with a spokesman [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=289.96s)]
*  for the United Nations calling the sites death traps. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=294.74s)]
*  In the past month, hundreds of people have been killed while they gathered to collect [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=298.48s)]
*  food, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and witnesses have reported Israeli troops [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=301.92s)]
*  opening fire near the sites. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=306.52s)]
*  The Israeli military has said it's fired, quote, warning shots. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=308.6s)]
*  There's still widespread hunger in Gaza. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=312.48s)]
*  According to the UN, most families survive on just one meal a day. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  At the Supreme Court, the justices have been handing down their final decisions of the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=324.86s)]
*  term. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=328.92s)]
*  Yesterday, they ruled that Planned Parenthood and one of its patients cannot sue South Carolina [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=329.92s)]
*  over its push to cut funding for the organization. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=334.88s)]
*  That could potentially make it easier for other states to also deny funding to Planned [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=337.9s)]
*  Parenthood. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=341.26s)]
*  And today, the court is expected to release a number of other decisions on hot button [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=342.46s)]
*  issues. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=346.82s)]
*  It will weigh in on President Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship for the children [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=347.82s)]
*  of undocumented immigrants and some temporary foreign residents. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=351.7s)]
*  It'll also rule on whether Texas can limit kids' access to online pornography by requiring [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  age verification. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=360.73999999999995s)]
*  And it'll issue a ruling on how race was used in drawing Louisiana's voting map in [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=362.85999999999996s)]
*  a case that could eventually determine which party controls the House of Representatives. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=367.74s)]
*  Those decisions and others are set to be announced at 10 a.m. Eastern. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=372.62s)]
*  And finally, two scientific studies published this week are adding to a growing body of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=382.54s)]
*  evidence that human activity is driving the evolution of some wild animals. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  Take for example the Eastern Baltic Cod. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=393.12s)]
*  If you were a fisherman in the Baltic Sea just a few decades ago, you would have been [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=396.26s)]
*  used to catching cod that could be the size of a human toddler. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=399.82s)]
*  But today, a typical fish is so much smaller it would fit in your cupped hands, according [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=403.42s)]
*  to a new study published in the journal Science Advances. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=408.08s)]
*  Researchers found that intense fishing in the region seems to have contributed to the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=412.02s)]
*  change in cod size. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=415.53999999999996s)]
*  Not because all the big cod were caught, but because the smaller ones had a survival advantage. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=417.58s)]
*  They could slip out of fishing nets, and over time, the genes of the fish actually [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=423.1s)]
*  shifted to help the species stay alive. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=427.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, at the Field Museum in Chicago, scientists found another case of human-driven [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  adaptation in rodents. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=435.54s)]
*  Researchers looked at about a century's worth of chipmunk specimens and discovered that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=438.66s)]
*  as the city grew, the animal's teeth got shorter. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=442.1s)]
*  All that human food and trash in the city might have meant there was less need for robust [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=445.66s)]
*  teeth to pierce into nuts and seeds. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=449.82s)]
*  And that changing diet could also explain why the chipmunk's skulls grew larger and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=452.58s)]
*  larger, potentially because they could pack on weight year-round. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=456.7s)]
*  Together, the studies showed just how fast human activity could be driving changes in [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=459.74s)]
*  animals. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=464.98s)]
*  As one of the Chicago scientists told the Times, quote, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=465.98s)]
*  There is evolution happening everywhere all the time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=468.58s)]
*  You just have to know where to look for it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=472.0s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=476.46s)]
*  Stick around. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=477.62s)]
*  We've got the Friday news quiz for you after the credits. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=478.62s)]
*  Today on The Daily, an inside look at the trial of Sean Combs as the jury prepares [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=481.34s)]

*  Now for the quiz. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=514.3s)]
*  We've got questions about three stories the Times has covered this week. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=515.78s)]
*  Can you answer them all? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=519.66s)]
*  First up. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=522.5s)]
*  We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities has set back Iran's ability [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=523.66s)]
*  to develop nuclear weapons for many years to come. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=529.46s)]
*  Trump faced questions this week over how much damage the U.S. has inflicted on Iran's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=532.86s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=537.9s)]
*  Trump has repeatedly claimed it was very high, using one particular word over and over again [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=539.58s)]
*  to describe the destruction. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=545.22s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=547.62s)]
*  That word is going to be bleeped out. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=548.62s)]
*  You tell us what it is. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  The original word that I use, I guess it got us in trouble because it's a strong word. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=551.98s)]
*  It was... [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=556.94s)]
*  And you'll see that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=557.94s)]
*  And it's going to come out. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=559.66s)]
*  The word is... [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=562.62s)]
*  Obliteration. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=565.66s)]
*  And I was told that they said it was total obliteration. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=566.66s)]
*  So far, U.S. intelligence assessments have confirmed substantial damage to the nuclear [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=570.58s)]
*  sites but have not used language that strong. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=575.1s)]
*  Okay, next up. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=584.5s)]
*  Florida's been leading on immigration enforcement, supporting the Trump administration and ISIS... [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=586.18s)]
*  State officials in Florida announced this week that they started work on an unusual [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=592.14s)]
*  new detention facility for migrants. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  This 30-square-mile area is completely surrounded by the Everglades. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=599.18s)]
*  When the site opens as soon as next month, people will be housed in large tents on an [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=603.8199999999999s)]
*  old airstrip surrounded by swampland, and officials have given it an ominous nickname. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=608.8599999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=615.26s)]
*  Here's a hint. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=619.26s)]
*  It's inspired by the notorious prison in San Francisco Bay. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=620.94s)]
*  The answer? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=627.5400000000001s)]
*  Alligator Alcatraz. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=629.22s)]
*  Florida's attorney general said that the alligators and pythons in the Everglades surrounding [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=630.22s)]
*  the facility will stop people from escaping. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=635.1s)]
*  Notably, President Trump once talked about trying to deter migrants from even entering [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=638.0600000000001s)]
*  the U.S. by building a moat along the U.S.-Mexico border and filling it with alligators or snakes. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=643.1s)]
*  Okay, last question. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=657.1s)]
*  We told you earlier this week about the Times list of the 100 best films of the 21st century. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=659.18s)]
*  Today, the top 20 came out. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=664.8199999999999s)]
*  We're going to play a clip from the top three movies on that list. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=667.38s)]
*  You have to identify each film. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=670.52s)]
*  Let's start at number three. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=673.04s)]
*  That's Daniel Day-Lewis starring in There Will Be Blood from 2007 with that unforgettable [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=692.04s)]
*  final scene. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  Next up, the number two film on the Times list. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=702.4399999999999s)]
*  This one's a bit tougher. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=705.0s)]
*  I can see him through the wall. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=706.0s)]
*  I can see his face. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=709.52s)]
*  I hope that I never see that face ever outside of a dream. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=712.4399999999999s)]
*  If you need a hint, the director was David Lynch. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=717.3s)]
*  And the movie is Mulholland Drive from 2001. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=722.5999999999999s)]
*  Lynch originally wrote and filmed part of it as a pilot for a TV show. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=726.8s)]
*  When ABC turned it down, he made it into a feature film instead. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=734.0s)]
*  Now, for the best film of the last 25 years, at least according to the directors, actors, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=738.24s)]
*  and other Hollywood insiders, the Times polled. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=745.24s)]
*  A hint on this one in 2020 became the first movie not in English to win Best Picture [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=748.24s)]
*  at the Academy Awards. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=761.44s)]
*  The answer, Parasite by South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=764.32s)]
*  Another one of his films, Memories of Murder, was also on the list. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=769.76s)]
*  You can see the full ranking at nytimes.com. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=773.64s)]
*  All right, that is it for the news quiz. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=776.4s)]
*  The headlines will be back on Monday with Tracy Mumford. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWDRZ6FE4E&t=781.3199999999999s)]
