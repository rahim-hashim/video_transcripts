# A Final Hunt for Undecided Voters, and Israel Escalates Its War in Lebanon
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=4.96s)]
*  Today is Monday, October 21st. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=8.6s)]
*  Voters in the seven battleground states are being inundated with advertising. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=13.88s)]
*  What kind of country do we want to live in? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=18.84s)]
*  On television. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=21.44s)]
*  Nothing will change with Kamala. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=22.44s)]
*  More weakness. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=24.28s)]
*  On their phones, on the internet, on the radio. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=25.28s)]
*  I've never been a political person. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=28.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=29.96s)]
*  And in their mailboxes, from the Harris Trump campaigns and their allies, that are trying [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=30.96s)]
*  to reach the small sliver of voters still undecided about either who to vote for or [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=35.72s)]
*  whether to vote at all. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=41.72s)]
*  Times reporter Reid Epstein is looking at how the Harris and Trump campaigns are locked [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  in a last-ditch hunt for undecided voters just two weeks out from Election Day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Both campaigns tell the Times they think the group that's still up for grabs is younger [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=53.82s)]
*  and disproportionately black and Latino. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=58.58s)]
*  But each campaign has their own research and their own strategy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=62.18s)]
*  The Trump research has found that undecided voters are much more focused on the economy, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=65.94s)]
*  particularly people who are struggling themselves. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=72.14s)]
*  They find that their target universe of undecided voters are more likely to be working multiple [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=74.58s)]
*  jobs and they are aiming to draw those voters away from Kamala Harris. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=79.02s)]
*  Reid says for the Harris campaign, they see a slightly larger undecided pool than Trump's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=85.66s)]
*  campaign does. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=90.94s)]
*  And in the final stretch, they're focused not just on reaching young voters of color, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=92.06s)]
*  but also Republican women who they believe dislike Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  The Harris campaign to reach those voters is doing a lot more advertising on Fox News [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  and trying to appeal to Republican women on Monday with events in the suburbs of Detroit, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  Philadelphia and Milwaukee. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=113.30000000000001s)]
*  Harris, who just set the record for the biggest fundraising quarter ever, bringing in a billion [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=115.74000000000001s)]
*  dollars from July through September, has more to spend on the voter hunt. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=122.42s)]
*  She and her supporters are scheduled to outspend Trump and his backers on TV and radio advertising [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  by 30 percent in these final weeks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=133.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, Elon Musk is dramatically ratcheting up his attempts to use his wealth to help [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=137.26s)]
*  Donald Trump win. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=143.33999999999997s)]
*  The billionaire announced that he would give away one million dollars once a day to a random [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=145.1s)]
*  registered Pennsylvania voter who signs a conservative petition put together by Musk's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  super PAC. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  It's part of an effort to register voters in Pennsylvania by today's deadline. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=156.7s)]
*  It's illegal under federal law to pay or offer to pay someone to register to vote, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=161.38s)]
*  but Musk's allies argue that he's only paying them to sign a petition, so it's not illegal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=166.46s)]
*  A former chairman of the Federal Election Committee tells the Times that it's something [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=171.98s)]
*  of a gray area, but, quote, not that close to the line. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=175.82s)]
*  Musk gave away the first million Saturday night, complete with an oversized check, and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=180.5s)]
*  his super PAC says it plans to expand the giveaway to registered voters from any battleground [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=185.14s)]
*  state who signed the petition between now and the election. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  Israel conducted a wave of airstrikes across Lebanon yesterday, targeting branches of the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=199.78s)]
*  financial association Al-Qa'r Al-Hasan, which U.S. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=204.98s)]
*  officials and others have long accused of being the de facto banking arm of Hezbollah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  Lebanon's traditional banking sector is in shambles, and Al-Qa'r Al-Hasan offers loans [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=213.62s)]
*  and financial services for people across Lebanon. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=218.66s)]
*  Many of its branches are in residential buildings. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=222.18s)]
*  Israel warned people living near the branches to evacuate. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=225.34s)]
*  The strikes mark an apparent escalation of Israel's war with Hezbollah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=228.94s)]
*  A senior Israeli official told the Times that targeting the banking system was intended [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=233.26s)]
*  to disrupt Hezbollah's day-to-day operations and make it harder to rebuild. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=237.7s)]
*  The strikes came after Israel says Hezbollah attempted to assassinate Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=242.62s)]
*  Netanyahu with a drone on Saturday. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=247.24s)]
*  The drone struck a building near Netanyahu's private residence, and no one was hurt. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=250.36s)]
*  As the strikes on Lebanon continue, U.S. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the number of civilian casualties there is, quote, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=258.08s)]
*  far too high, and that he would like to see Israel scale back some of the strikes, especially [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=263.24s)]
*  near Beirut. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=268.44s)]
*  Austin is the most senior U.S. official to say that publicly. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=270.12s)]
*  He also blamed Hezbollah for hiding its headquarters and weapons among the civilian population. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=274.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, the killing of Hamas leader Yaya Sinwar last week raised some hopes that negotiations [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  to end the war might gain new momentum. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  But the Israeli government, Hamas, and Hezbollah have all signaled they will not back down, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  and the violence instead appears to be ramping up. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=295.24s)]
*  A major Israeli airstrike on Saturday in northern Gaza left at least 87 people dead or missing, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  according to the Gazan Health Ministry, with dozens more wounded and many people still [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=305.28s)]
*  trapped under the rubble. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  In Cuba, experts have been warning for years that the country's power grid was on the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=319.88s)]
*  verge of collapse. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=323.96s)]
*  It relies on half a century old power plants and requires fuel imports that the government [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=325.84s)]
*  can barely afford. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=330.84s)]
*  On Friday, the worst predictions came to pass. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=332.88s)]
*  The grid collapsed, plunging the island into darkness. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  Despite efforts to fix it, the grid collapsed again and again over the weekend. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=339.64s)]
*  When the light came on in the local neighborhood I'm in, there were cheers for joy. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=344.08s)]
*  And then about 40 minutes later, it went out and there were groans. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=349.44s)]
*  Ed Augustine is reporting for The Times from Havana. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  He says Cuba has dealt with rolling blackouts for years, but this time feels different. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  The hospitals are now running on generators, and government officials have acknowledged [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  they can't be sure when power will be completely restored. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=365.32s)]
*  I don't have power. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=368.56s)]
*  The neighbors don't have power. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=370.2s)]
*  Most of Havana doesn't have power right now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=371.2s)]
*  The result of that is that most people where I am at the moment have to go to the local [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  the local well to haul up water by bucket because there's no electricity to get it up [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=379.24s)]
*  to the water tanks on the buildings. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  So we're talking about the essentials of life. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=388.04s)]
*  Less water when water is already scarce, less food when food is already scarce. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=389.92s)]
*  And it makes the day to day existence of people even more difficult than it normally is. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=395.0s)]
*  As Cuba scrambles to restore electricity, the country's juggling compounding disasters. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  The [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=406.32s)]
*  And the lack of electricity will likely complicate any rescue or recovery efforts from the storm. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=410.34s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=421.64s)]
*  28 years in the making, the New York Liberty are WNBA champions. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=422.64s)]
*  The WNBA finals wrapped up with a dramatic overtime win by the New York Liberty over [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=431.52s)]
*  the Minnesota Lynx. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  It's the Liberty's first WNBA title ever, having lost in the finals five times before. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  This is something special right here and I'm trying not to cry but oh my god this is amazing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=444.68s)]
*  It's also the first major basketball championship for any New York team, men or women, since [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=450.2s)]
*  the 1970s. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=455.88s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=462.52s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at how the housing crisis in Nevada could be the motivating factor [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=465.28s)]
*  for voters in the battleground state. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=471.12s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mkvC6U-0bA&t=474.15999999999997s)]
