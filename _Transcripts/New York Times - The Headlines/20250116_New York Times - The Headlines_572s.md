# What to Know About the Cease-Fire Deal, and Biden Warns the Nation
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=0.0s)]
*  16th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Last minute disputes have come up surrounding the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=14.96s)]
*  Israel's cabinet has yet to meet to formally ratify it. And this morning, the office of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=20.2s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of reneging on the agreement [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=24.52s)]
*  before it's even been put in place. But a senior Hamas official says the group is committed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=29.76s)]
*  to it. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas agreed to the terms yesterday after 15 months of [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=34.92s)]
*  war. And news of the agreement set off celebrations in the streets of Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=40.96s)]
*  In Israel, families of the remaining hostages held out hope that the deal would mean their [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=47.08s)]
*  loved ones are returned soon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  It's like a roller coaster. I'm not breathing right now. We don't know if they're on the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=55.4s)]
*  list, if they're alive. We actually don't know anything. So it's scary. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=61.12s)]
*  The Hamas-led attack that set the war in motion on October 7th, 2023, killed some 1,200 people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=66.36s)]
*  in Israel. The Israeli bombings and raids that followed killed some 45,000 Palestinians [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=72.84s)]
*  in Gaza and destroyed much of the territory. The fighting is now set to stop Sunday for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=78.44s)]
*  the first phase of a multi-step truce. The deal's largely what the Biden administration [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=84.32s)]
*  pushed months ago. Officials say pressure from the White House and from the incoming [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=89.88s)]
*  Trump administration helped push it over the finish line. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  I think the general atmosphere, the phrase I hear most is people are just holding their [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=98.52s)]
*  breath. There's a lot of hope, but obviously a lot of trepidation as well because so much [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=103.96s)]
*  can go wrong. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=111.44s)]
*  Isabel Kirchner has been covering the negotiations. She got access to a draft of the ceasefire [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=112.96s)]
*  agreement. She says the first phase of the deal is relatively straightforward. Over the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=117.44s)]
*  next six weeks, Israeli troops will pull back away from populated areas in Gaza. Hamas will [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  release 33 hostages. But it will take a lot more negotiations to continue the truce. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  The next six weeks is supposed to take us into the second phase of the deal when the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  hostages are supposed to be released. That is extremely loosely worded how you transition [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=139.32s)]
*  from phase one to phase two and is indeed yet to be negotiated. There has to be a negotiation [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=146.2s)]
*  which will deal with the key fundamental stumbling block that we've had all along, which is the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=153.34s)]
*  idea of moving from a temporary ceasefire to a permanent cessation of hostilities or [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=162.36s)]
*  in other words an end of the war. So essentially the biggest obstacles and problems still remain [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  to be resolved. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=178.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Gazans that I spoke to were thrilled that the fighting was coming to a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  halt, at least for a short while. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=188.36s)]
*  My colleague Aaron Boxerman has been on the phone with people in Gaza who are trying to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=190.92s)]
*  figure out what the deal will mean for life there. The agreement calls for a surge of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=194.94s)]
*  humanitarian aid and it will allow many Palestinians to return to parts of Gaza they were forced [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=199.88s)]
*  to leave. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=205.42s)]
*  One woman described mixed feelings. She was of course happy that the fighting might be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=206.54s)]
*  coming to an end. But she wondered whether she had any future with her family in devastated [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=210.64s)]
*  Gaza, whether Gaza would ever be rebuilt and what their lives would look like. Another [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=217.2s)]
*  person I spoke to believes his home in northern Gaza was destroyed, that he has nowhere to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=223.56s)]
*  go back to with his family. He also wondered who would control Gaza when the dust settles. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=228.24s)]
*  If the war is ending, which it might be, would Hamas remain the most powerful force there? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=234.68s)]
*  This will be my final address to you from the American people from the Oval Office, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=246.68s)]
*  from this desk as president. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=255.44s)]
*  Last night, President Biden addressed the nation in his farewell speech from the White [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=257.52s)]
*  House. And my colleague Peter Baker, the Times' chief White House correspondent, was covering [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=261.56s)]
*  the event. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=265.92s)]
*  So President Biden didn't talk very much about the accomplishments he feels quite proud of, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=266.92s)]
*  including his bringing the country out of the pandemic and rebuilding the economy and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=273.64000000000004s)]
*  managing the war in Ukraine and so forth. Instead of that, he was focused on where the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=278.8s)]
*  country is going in the future in a larger sense. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  He issued a particularly striking warning against an oligarchy that he sees emerging [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=300.88s)]
*  as taking control, he argues, of the country. And of course, that's a reference to Elon [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=308.68s)]
*  Musk and others in the billionaire circle of Donald Trump, who in Biden's way of thinking [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=313.32s)]
*  are promoting their own interests over those of the public. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=320.04s)]
*  By branding the incoming Trump circle as an oligarchy, Biden is going straight at the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=324.68s)]
*  attention at the heart of the emerging White House. Are they really populists intent on [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=329.32s)]
*  shaking up the government to benefit working people or just billionaire disruptors out [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=334.44s)]
*  to enrich themselves? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  Now it's your turn to stand guard. May you all be the keeper of the flame. May you keep [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  the faith. I love America. You love it too. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=347.36s)]
*  And in the end, he wraps up by saying, it's your turn now to the American public and saying, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=352.44s)]
*  OK, as this new president comes in, it's up to you to hold him accountable and to make [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  sure that he follows the values and the standards that America has come to know over these last [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=363.24s)]
*  two and a half centuries. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=370.16s)]
*  Early this morning in Cape Canaveral, Florida, Jeff Bezos, his space company, Blue Origin, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=384.9s)]
*  launched its first rocket into orbit. It's called New Glenn. It's taller than the Empire [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=393.7s)]
*  State Building. The launch marks the start of a new chapter in the private space race [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=399.14s)]
*  as Bezos tries to catch up with Elon Musk and his company, SpaceX. SpaceX is currently [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=406.88s)]
*  launching more than two rockets a week on average. To try and match that, Bezos has [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=412.82s)]
*  poured billions of dollars of his own money into Blue Origin, and he left his position [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=417.34s)]
*  as the CEO of Amazon in 2023 in part to focus on this. Today's liftoff wasn't flawless. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=421.76s)]
*  The rocket's booster, which was supposed to touch down on a floating barge, crash landed [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=428.88s)]
*  instead. But if Blue Origin starts making regular launches, it could shake up SpaceX's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=433.06s)]
*  on the market. Right now, NASA, the Pentagon, and commercial companies have few options [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=439.9s)]
*  other than SpaceX for getting things like satellites into space. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=445.06s)]
*  And finally, last year, Kendrick Lamar and Drake dominated the Billboard charts by dropping [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=454.5s)]
*  deeply personal diss tracks about each other, one after the other. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  Now, the rap battle has turned into a legal battle. On Wednesday, Drake sued Universal [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=463.66s)]
*  Music Group, the record label that represents both of the artists, for defamation and harassment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=476.06s)]
*  The lawsuit centers on the song many considered to be Lamar's winning blow over Drake. The [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=481.74s)]
*  track, Not Like Us, calls Drake and his crew certified pedophiles. It's been streamed [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=489.74s)]
*  more than a billion times. Drake's lawyers say the song put his reputation and life at [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=495.98s)]
*  risk by hiding, quote, dangerous lyrics behind a catchy beat. The album art for Not Like [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=505.1s)]
*  Us featured a photo of Drake's home dotted with red markers meant to show it was full [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=510.94s)]
*  sex offenders. Drake's lawsuit points out there was then a shooting at his house and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=516.14s)]
*  other people tried to trespass on the property. In a statement, Universal Music Group dismissed [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=521.1800000000001s)]
*  Drake's claim that the company valued profits over his safety and accused him of trying to, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  quote, weaponize the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression. The lawsuit [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=531.34s)]
*  may only drive more interest in the song. It's up for Song of the Year at the Grammys next month, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=537.74s)]
*  and Lamar is headlining the Super Bowl the week after. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=543.18s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, Times Jerusalem Bureau Chief Patrick Kingsley [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=550.2199999999999s)]
*  on what the ceasefire could mean for the Middle East. That's next in the New York Times audio [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=555.7399999999999s)]
*  app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnzASWsbPWo&t=560.78s)]
