# Foreign Election Interference, and Volkswagen May Close Factories
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, October 29th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=6.44s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=8.64s)]
*  U.S. intelligence officials, as well as tech companies and researchers, tell the Times [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=12.16s)]
*  that efforts by Russia, Iran, and China to interfere in the election are more sophisticated [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  and harder to track than ever before. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  The big concern isn't that foreign powers will be able to affect voting machines or [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=27.44s)]
*  vote counts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=31.34s)]
*  Instead, they're trying to potentially spark chaos by spreading disinformation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=32.6s)]
*  Back in 2016, that mostly looked like Russia posting on Facebook. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=38.36s)]
*  Now there have been Russian operatives pushing pro-Trump messaging on Reddit. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=43.0s)]
*  There are hundreds of Chinese accounts on Telegram trying to rile up college students [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  over the war in Gaza. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  And Iran has created sites like one called Not Our War that's aimed at American veterans [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=53.28s)]
*  and filled with conspiracy theories and anti-American content. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=59.36s)]
*  Experts say the efforts this election year show a much more nuanced understanding of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=64.16s)]
*  American politics, and they've been supercharged by the rise of AI, using tools like ChatGPT [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=68.72s)]
*  to churn out huge amounts of subtle, targeted propaganda. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=75.64s)]
*  At the same time, tech giants like Meta and Google have scaled back their efforts to label [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=80.04s)]
*  or take down disinformation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=85.68s)]
*  While each country trying to interfere in the election has its own specific aims, like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  Russia rooting for Trump or Iran pushing for Harris, experts say they all share a common [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=92.76s)]
*  goal, undermining American democracy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  At approximately 3 a.m., officers responded to reports of a fire at a ballot box right [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=101.48s)]
*  outside the building that we're in right now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, authorities say they're investigating two fires in ballot drop boxes just miles [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=119.0s)]
*  apart in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=124.72s)]
*  The fire at the Portland box was put out by a built-in extinguisher, but at the other [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=128.24s)]
*  box in Vancouver, hundreds of ballots may have been destroyed, and officials urged anyone [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=132.84s)]
*  who submitted their ballot there to contact the elections department to get a replacement. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=138.0s)]
*  Please do not let today's incidents or anything that happens between now and election day [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=142.44s)]
*  to keep you from expressing yourself with your vote. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=147.4s)]
*  Authorities say the incidents are connected and that they have identified a suspect vehicle [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  from surveillance footage, though it's not clear what motivated the apparent arson. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=156.16s)]
*  Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security specifically warned about potential [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=160.96s)]
*  arson attacks on ballot boxes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=165.56s)]
*  Oh, it's great to be back in Michigan. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=168.2s)]
*  How's everybody doing? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=176.72s)]
*  On the campaign trail, Kamala Harris made three stops in Michigan yesterday, racing across [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=179.2s)]
*  the battleground state to a factory in Saginaw, a union training facility near Detroit, and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=184.4s)]
*  to Ann Arbor, where she and her running mate Tim Walz spoke to a crowd of supporters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=189.95999999999998s)]
*  Let me tell you something, as I travel our country, there is an overwhelming call for [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=194.68s)]
*  a fresh start. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=200.28s)]
*  At times, Harris had to talk over protesters who were shouting about the war in Gaza. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  Hey, guys, I hear you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=206.92s)]
*  On the subject of Gaza, we all want this war to end as soon as possible and get the hostages [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=209.28s)]
*  out and I will do everything in my power to make it so. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  Michigan has one of the largest Arab and Muslim populations in the country, and voters there [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=223.24s)]
*  have been signaling for a year that they're angry over U.S. support for Israel's military [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=227.72s)]
*  operations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=232.56s)]
*  Despite that, Harris' campaign officials tell The Times they think she's in a solid position [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=234.16s)]
*  in Michigan and in the rest of the so-called Blue Wall, which includes Pennsylvania and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=238.68s)]
*  Wisconsin. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=244.56s)]
*  Ahead of the election, The Times has been looking at how Donald Trump's business dealings [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=250.8s)]
*  could create an ethical minefield if he's reelected. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=255.32s)]
*  When he became president in 2017, the Trump Organization remained open for business. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=259.36s)]
*  Lobbyists, lawmakers, and foreign officials spent big money at his private clubs and at [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=264.8s)]
*  the Trump Hotel he owned just blocks from the White House. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=271.0s)]
*  Trump did agree to some ethical constraints on his business while in office, the key one [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=274.92s)]
*  being that it would not do any new foreign deals. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=280.16s)]
*  But this time around, Trump's not committing to that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=283.6s)]
*  We've asked his campaign whether or not they were willing to adopt something should he [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=286.92s)]
*  win and they've not really answered the question. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=290.68s)]
*  We've asked his family business whether they would be willing to adopt something and once [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=294.56s)]
*  again they were non-committal as well. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  Times reporter Ben Protest has been looking at Trump's potential conflicts of interest. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=302.64s)]
*  He says this year alone, the Trump Organization has struck real estate deals in Vietnam, Saudi [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=307.28s)]
*  Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  These are countries that are central to American foreign policy. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=315.64s)]
*  The country relies on many of these as crucial allies and so you have this awkward tension [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=319.96s)]
*  potentially where they're not just foreign policy allies but they're also allies of the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  president's family business. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=330.52s)]
*  Another potential conflict, Trump recently unveiled a cryptocurrency venture which could [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=332.88s)]
*  face oversight from federal regulators that Trump would be in charge of appointing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=338.12s)]
*  Combined with the foreign deals, Ben says that would likely make Trump the most conflicted [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=343.67999999999995s)]
*  president in U.S. history. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=348.44s)]
*  Without the voluntary ethics guardrails, there's not a lot that can be done to curb his potential [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=350.67999999999995s)]
*  conflicts of interest. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  If he breaks the law theoretically and commits an act of bribery, then prosecutors could [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=357.52s)]
*  try to bring a case against him. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  But in the Supreme Court's immunity ruling this summer, they basically decided that presidents [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  have broad immunity for official acts they took as president. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  And so you do have a potential situation where there's not a whole lot of remedies [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=373.88s)]
*  to reining in this president. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=378.08s)]
*  Volkswagen, the iconic German car company, could be on the verge of laying off tens of [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=387.28s)]
*  thousands of workers in Germany and shutting as many as three factories. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=392.68s)]
*  The closures would be the first ever in the 87-year history of the company. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=397.84s)]
*  The potential layoffs were announced by Volkswagen's top employee representative. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=402.92s)]
*  The company itself declined to comment on its plans. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=407.72s)]
*  But VW has been struggling. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=411.16s)]
*  Car sales in Europe have plummeted since the pandemic. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=413.62s)]
*  And in China, one of its other big markets, consumers have been increasingly buying Chinese-made [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  electric vehicles instead of imports. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=422.04s)]
*  If the factories close, it would be a major hit to Germany's economy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=425.44s)]
*  Car manufacturing is the country's biggest industry, and VW is the country's biggest employer. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=430.16s)]
*  And finally, Alfred Hitchcock tried to warn us. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=443.44000000000005s)]
*  The crows, it turns out, are planning something. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  The highly intelligent birds can mimic human speech, use tools, remember faces, and hold [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=451.04s)]
*  a grudge. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  To quote one expert, they're excellent grudge holders. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=459.24s)]
*  They can even pass them on. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=462.52s)]
*  When a group of crows, technically called a murder, singles out a person they deem dangerous, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=464.94s)]
*  they seem to be able to pass that on for generations. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=470.68s)]
*  Basically, you shake a rake at some crows in your yard one day, and their children could [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=473.8s)]
*  one day seek revenge, in Nigo Montoya style. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=478.56s)]
*  They're known to dive bomb and screech at their targets. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  There's even a website, Crow Tracks, where people have started reporting wrath-seeking [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=485.16s)]
*  crows. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  But crow justice may not always be carried out correctly. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=491.12s)]
*  One researcher tells the Times that crows are susceptible to mistaken identity, so not everyone [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  getting the caca-caca treatment necessarily deserves it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=500.5s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=506.6s)]
*  Today, on The Daily, how the U.S. ended up with an immigration system that most Americans [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=507.6s)]
*  think is broken. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=515.72s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2FkjvjpixA&t=520.52s)]
