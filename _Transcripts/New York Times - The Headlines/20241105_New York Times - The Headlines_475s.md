# Election Day Decisions, and Why the Count Could Take Awhile
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=4.9s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, November 5th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=5.9s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=8.0s)]
*  So Bob, can you start by telling me who are you going to vote for and why? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I intend to vote for Donald Trump because I feel he'll have a different direction for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  our country to go into. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=24.88s)]
*  I supported Kamala after doing a little bit of soul searching. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=27.84s)]
*  My daughter was happy that I voted for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=32.84s)]
*  Today is election day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=37.36s)]
*  Tens of millions of Americans are making their final choice. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=39.6s)]
*  And the Times has been talking with voters in swing states as they've weighed their [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=42.92s)]
*  options. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  I feel like she is predictable. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  She seems to have, you know, stable values. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=51.42s)]
*  I think they'll help us out on gas prices. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=54.44s)]
*  I think you'll help us out on inflation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=57.44s)]
*  I am voting for Trump, but it's a reluctant vote. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=60.52s)]
*  I'm not going to sit here and be like, oh, like, he's the man, you know. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=63.56s)]
*  I feel like around here, truth be told, the names of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are basically [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=68.48s)]
*  cuss words. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=74.44s)]
*  It's been heartbreaking because I wish we could have a more calm, thoughtful public [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=75.44s)]
*  discourse like I've been used to before. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=79.72s)]
*  Whether I'm going to vote for Trump or not cast a ballot for president at all, it's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=82.56s)]
*  still kind of up in the air. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=88.08s)]
*  So when do you plan to make the decision? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=90.68s)]
*  It could be as late as when I walk into the polling section. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=94.76s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  So America comes down to this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  One more day. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=107.0s)]
*  Just one more day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=109.04s)]
*  This is it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=110.92s)]
*  This is the last one that we're going to have to do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=111.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Donald Trump made the final speeches of their campaigns last night in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=115.92s)]
*  a last minute push to keep the votes rolling in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=120.0s)]
*  The two candidates hit opposite notes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=123.16s)]
*  Kamala has delivered soaring prices. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=126.52s)]
*  And true economic anguish at home, war and chaos abroad. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=133.96s)]
*  And a nation destroying invasion on our southern border. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=139.12s)]
*  Trump painted a picture of the country on the brink of collapse while Harris closed [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=143.24s)]
*  out with a message of unity. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=147.84s)]
*  America is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward where we see our fellow [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=150.32s)]
*  American not as an enemy, but as a neighbor. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=158.24s)]
*  Now the candidates are off the campaign trail and getting ready to watch the results start [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=165.12s)]
*  rolling in. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=169.32s)]
*  Harris is holding an election watch party at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=170.76s)]
*  D.C., while Trump will host his watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=176.04s)]
*  For years it was an American tradition to watch the news or log on to a new site and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=186.08s)]
*  follow along with results until some point in the night where we knew who won the presidential [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=193.24s)]
*  election on election day. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=198.72s)]
*  That has changed. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Nick Kourosanidi covers voting for the Times. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  He's been talking with state and local election officials who have been urging one thing today, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=204.84s)]
*  patience. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=210.0s)]
*  There's only a small chance results will be clear by the end of the night. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=211.2s)]
*  In the last presidential election, it took four days until Saturday morning for an official [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=215.24s)]
*  call to be made. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=219.96s)]
*  Votes have shifted later because of the rise of mail-in voting, which surged during the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=222.12s)]
*  pandemic and has continued to reshape American elections. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=226.56s)]
*  Millions and millions of voters now cast a mail ballot, and mail ballots take a lot longer [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=231.28s)]
*  to process than an in-person ballot. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  Election officials need to open the ballots, check for their eligibility, flatten them, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=240.1s)]
*  get them ready for tabulators or however they're counted. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=245.12s)]
*  It's a time-consuming process. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=248.04s)]
*  And two very critical states to determining who is going to win the presidency, Wisconsin [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=250.04s)]
*  and Pennsylvania, don't allow their election officials to begin processing mail ballots [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  until the morning of election day. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=261.0s)]
*  That creates a pretty long backlog. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  Aside from mail ballots, this race is expected to be extremely close, and extremely close [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=266.64s)]
*  sometimes automatically triggers a recount, or state law allows a losing candidate to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=273.11999999999995s)]
*  request a recount. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  That will also delay when we would know who won the presidential election. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=280.88s)]
*  And amid all of this uncertainty, the prolonged period before we have a call has proven to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  be pretty ripe for a flood of disinformation about the security of our elections, false [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=293.4s)]
*  claims about who might have won a state or the overall election. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=299.08s)]
*  And it's in this period before we know that we've really seen disinformation spread like [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=303.24s)]
*  wildfire, even though this is the election process working exactly as it should. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=310.48s)]
*  Beyond the presidential race, today's election will be a critical test for abortion access [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=316.16s)]
*  across the U.S. Voters in 10 states are deciding whether to enshrine abortion rights in their [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  state constitutions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=338.04s)]
*  That includes several states where the procedure is currently restricted or banned. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=340.16s)]
*  Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=344.8s)]
*  Most of the ballot measures would allow abortion until about 24 weeks of pregnancy, effectively [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=349.76s)]
*  going back to what was allowed under Roe v. Wade. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe, voters have sided with abortion rights [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  in every state where the question has appeared on the ballot. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=364.3s)]
*  A survey earlier this year from the Pew Research Center found that 63% of Americans think abortion [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  should be legal in all or most cases. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=374.08s)]
*  And finally, for anyone voting today, that mostly means heading to a high school gym, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=383.12s)]
*  town hall, library. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=387.84s)]
*  The Times has been looking at some of the more unusual options. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  In Chicago, you can cast your vote and get your laundry done. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=394.08s)]
*  They've got polling booths set up at a laundromat. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=398.12s)]
*  In San Francisco, there's a bakery slash polling station that apparently sells a lot of almond [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=400.92s)]
*  croissants on Election Day. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=405.88s)]
*  And Ames, Iowa has a polling location in an arcade for a side of pinball with democracy. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  And for astronauts on the International Space Station, who are obviously a little far from [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=414.98s)]
*  their usual polling spots, they can still vote. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  They fill in their ballots and beam the encrypted data to an antenna in New Mexico. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  From there, their ballots are sent directly to the voting clerks in their hometowns. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=429.36s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=438.48s)]
*  Today on The Daily, The Times Chief Political Analyst Nate Cohn on how election night will [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  unfold state by state. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=445.24s)]
*  And throughout the day and into the night, The Times will have live coverage of every [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=448.24s)]
*  development, from what's happening in the battleground states to which party will take [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=452.6s)]
*  control of the House and Senate. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=457.12s)]
*  That's all at nytimes.com or in the NYT app. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=459.28s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=463.0s)]
*  The headlines will be back tomorrow with the latest on the election results. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9uXJ69ArSM&t=464.0s)]
