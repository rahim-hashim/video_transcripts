# Supreme Court Considers Trump’s Power, and Musk’s Team Wants Access to I.R.S. Records
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Monday, February 17. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=6.28s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=8.32s)]
*  President Trump is pushing forward with his plan for the U.S. to negotiate directly with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=14.52s)]
*  Russia over an end to the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=18.84s)]
*  This week, top American officials are set to have face-to-face meetings with Russian [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=22.28s)]
*  officials in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=26.42s)]
*  So far, it's not clear if Ukraine will be involved in the talks at all, even though [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=28.82s)]
*  it's said that it will not accept a peace deal that it doesn't help negotiate. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=33.8s)]
*  The plans for a U.S.-Russia meeting come after Trump shocked Ukraine and much of Europe by [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=38.86s)]
*  having a 90-minute call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the West had tried to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=45.22s)]
*  isolate for years ever since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=50.22s)]
*  Trump is rethinking the entire dynamic here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=54.44s)]
*  That has some people uncomfortable. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=57.86s)]
*  On Fox News yesterday, Mike Walz, Trump's national security adviser, defended the president's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=59.86s)]
*  approach to the war. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=65.28s)]
*  Look, the Ukrainian people have fought valiantly. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=66.62s)]
*  The United States and Europe have supported this effort, but the United States unquestionably [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=70.36s)]
*  has borne the brunt of that support over the years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=76.3s)]
*  Walz said the U.S. is open to supporting Ukraine going forward, but that it needs something [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=80.5s)]
*  in return. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=85.62s)]
*  He doubled down on a proposal by the administration to have Ukraine give the U.S. 50 percent of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=86.94s)]
*  its mineral rights, including for lithium, uranium and graphite, if it wants the U.S. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=92.42s)]
*  to keep sending military aid. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's presidents rejected that demand, but Walz suggested the U.S. will keep pushing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=100.82s)]
*  them to accept that kind of deal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=105.38s)]
*  The American people deserve to be recouped, deserve to have some type of payback for the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=107.68s)]
*  billions that they have invested in this war. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=114.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's direct outreach to Russia and sidelining of Ukraine have sent European [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  leaders scrambling. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=124.4s)]
*  In Paris, leaders from France, Germany, Britain, Italy and other countries are gathering for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=125.64000000000001s)]
*  an emergency meeting to discuss if Europe can continue to rely on the U.S. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  Today on The Daily, my colleague Anton Troianovsky explains how Trump has shaken the U.S.-European [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=136.64s)]
*  alliance. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=142.2s)]
*  They obviously knew that the Trump presidency was going to be different from Joe Biden, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=143.2s)]
*  but they were not expecting such a dramatic departure from American post-World War II [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=147.88s)]
*  consensus about foreign policy, which was America is committed to NATO, committed to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=155.44s)]
*  the defense of Europe and committed to protecting democracies that find themselves threatened. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=161.96s)]
*  The first legal case testing how President Trump has been trying to reshape the federal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=178.0s)]
*  government has reached the Supreme Court. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=182.82s)]
*  The case centers on how his administration fired the head of a watchdog agency that protects [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=186.08s)]
*  whistleblowers and enforces ethics rules. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=191.28s)]
*  The law says that the head of the agency, who was confirmed by Congress for a five-year [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=194.48s)]
*  term, can only be removed by the president for, quote, inefficiency, neglect of duty [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=199.36s)]
*  or malfeasance. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=205.46s)]
*  But the Trump administration fired him in a one-sentence email without giving any reason, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=207.16s)]
*  and he sued. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=211.58s)]
*  After legal challenges in lower courts, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=213.08s)]
*  which it's expected to do in the next few days. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=218.58s)]
*  The question will be whether Congress has the power to pass laws limiting who the president [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=221.58s)]
*  can fire. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=226.58s)]
*  Precedent says it does, based on a Supreme Court ruling from the 1930s. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=228.44s)]
*  But in recent years, the conservative justices on the court have called that an unconstitutional [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=233.24s)]
*  limit on the president's power and have already laid the groundwork for overturning it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=238.5s)]
*  The Times has learned that the Internal Revenue Service is preparing to give a member of Elon [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=248.58s)]
*  Musk's team access to millions of American-sensitive data. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  That includes tax returns, banking details, Social Security numbers, and other private [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=259.26s)]
*  information. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  The IRS is expected to let the employee, a young software engineer, have broad access [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  to the agency's systems. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=270.82s)]
*  A White House spokesman said it was part of an effort to root out waste, fraud, and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=272.94s)]
*  abuse, and that it, quote, takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=277.1s)]
*  It's the latest move by a member of Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=283.02s)]
*  team to get an unprecedented view into government systems. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=287.82s)]
*  They've been going beyond what is typical, including their recent push to dig into the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=291.82s)]
*  United States Treasury system that directs all payments across the federal government. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=296.34s)]
*  The effort has faced legal challenges. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=301.9s)]
*  The new move to access the IRS data could also end up in court. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=304.34s)]
*  This is one of the most serious weather events we've dealt with in at least a decade. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=319.46s)]
*  In Kentucky, severe rainstorms have flooded parts of the state, stranding residents and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=324.62s)]
*  leaving at least nine people dead. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=329.32s)]
*  Tens of thousands of residents have lost power, and Governor Andy Beshear said rescue efforts [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=331.96s)]
*  could last all week. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=336.84s)]
*  This may be a record, but portions of more than 300 state roads and federal roads are [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=338.48s)]
*  currently blocked due to flooding, slides, or damage. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=343.12s)]
*  Again, that means we have this type of damage and disruption statewide. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=347.0s)]
*  It's yet another severe weather event for a state that has been battered by storms, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=352.32s)]
*  mudslides, and numerous floods in recent years. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=356.52s)]
*  And as climate change drives up the risk of flooding, the state is trying to find long-term [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=360.0s)]
*  solutions. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=364.79999999999995s)]
*  In one effort, they've been trying to move entire communities up to higher ground. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=365.79999999999995s)]
*  The state has spent hundreds of millions of dollars reclaiming old mining sites on top [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=370.4s)]
*  of cleared mountains to build housing there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=375.2s)]
*  For now, people in Kentucky are already bracing for more intense weather. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=378.44s)]
*  In the coming days, another storm could dump up to six inches of snow. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=382.68s)]
*  And finally, if you have ever forgotten your password, your PIN number, your friend's [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=393.32s)]
*  birthday, this is not going to make you feel better about yourself. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=397.92s)]
*  This month, the Memory League World Championship crowned a new winner, Vijval Rajakumar, who [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=402.12s)]
*  was able to memorize a string of 80 random numbers after looking at them for only 13.5 [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=408.36s)]
*  seconds. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=415.16s)]
*  80 numbers, all of them in 13 and a half seconds. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=416.16s)]
*  Rajakumar is a 20-year-old college student from India. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=421.12s)]
*  He said he cried when he won. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=424.48s)]
*  And he shared his winning strategies with the Times. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  His big advice is to use the Memory Palace technique. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=430.0s)]
*  There's a lot of variations of that, but it generally involves visualizing a large [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=433.48s)]
*  house and then you assign different bits of information and memories to each room. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=437.44s)]
*  When you want to remember something, you mentally walk through the house and check the rooms. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  Rajakumar essentially stashed numbers in his mental kitchen and bedroom and bathroom and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=447.12s)]
*  then sprinted back through it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=451.48s)]
*  His other tip for memory is maybe easier to pull off, and that is hydration. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=453.56s)]
*  Just drink a lot of water. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=458.76s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=460.6s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=464.32000000000005s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-6OmSed-Mw&t=465.32000000000005s)]
