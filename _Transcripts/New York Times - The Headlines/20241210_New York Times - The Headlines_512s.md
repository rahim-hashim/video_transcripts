# C.E.O. Shooting Suspect Arrested, and Netanyahu’s Corruption Trial
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, December 10th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=8.0s)]
*  After a five-day long manhunt, a suspect has been arrested and charged in the murder of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=14.08s)]
*  UnitedHealthcare's CEO. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=18.84s)]
*  He has been identified as Luigi Nicolass Mangione. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=20.96s)]
*  He's a male, 26 years old. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=24.36s)]
*  He was born and raised in Maryland. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=26.44s)]
*  Luigi Mangione was arrested yesterday at a McDonald's in central Pennsylvania after an [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=28.52s)]
*  employee recognized him from photos and called in a tip. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=33.68s)]
*  We asked for the public's help in identifying this subject, and the public responded. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  The NYPD's chief of detectives, Joseph Kenney, said Mangione was sitting eating when local [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=42.0s)]
*  officers responded to the call. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=47.64s)]
*  He was found with a fake ID that matched the one used by the suspect. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=50.36s)]
*  He had a gun, potentially made with a 3D printer, a silencer, and a three-page handwritten manifesto [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=54.78s)]
*  condemning the healthcare industry for putting profits over patients. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=62.42s)]
*  We don't think that there's any specific threats to other people mentioned in that document, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=67.34s)]
*  but it does seem that he has some ill will toward corporate America. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=71.2s)]
*  Mangione's been charged with second-degree murder, as well as other crimes in both New [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  York and Pennsylvania. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=79.7s)]
*  The Times has been gathering more details about his background. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=82.14s)]
*  He was a high achiever growing up, valedictorian at a private high school in Baltimore, and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=85.5s)]
*  he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with degrees in engineering. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=90.66s)]
*  We don't know if he had a personal experience with the insurance company, but we do know [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=94.94s)]
*  that he had been in regular contact with his friends and his family until about six months ago. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=100.54s)]
*  My colleague Maria Kramer has been looking into Mangione's background. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  That's when he suddenly stopped communicating with them, and his friends have told us that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=110.62s)]
*  he had been suffering from a painful back injury at the time, and that's when communication [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=116.22s)]
*  went dark and his relatives and friends began to become very anxious about him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  Why hadn't anyone heard from him? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=126.5s)]
*  Maria walks through more of her reporting on today's episode of The Daily. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=128.86s)]
*  In Manhattan yesterday, a jury delivered a verdict in the Subway chokehold case that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=132.7s)]
*  became a flashpoint in the debate over mental health and public safety. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=145.26s)]
*  Daniel Penny was found not guilty in the death of Jordan Neely. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=149.62s)]
*  On May 1st of last year, Penny, who was white, restrained Neely, who was black, after Neely [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  got on the subway and began yelling. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  Some witnesses described Neely's behavior as frightening. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=162.7s)]
*  Penny told detectives he thought he was a threat. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=166.46s)]
*  But after his death, some held Neely up as an example of a person who needed help but [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=169.38s)]
*  fell through the cracks in the system. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=174.42s)]
*  Neely was homeless and had a history of mental health problems. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=176.82s)]
*  Leaders of the city council's Black, Latino, and Asian caucus said the verdict, quote, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=180.5s)]
*  effectively greenlights vigilante justice against the most vulnerable New Yorkers. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=185.22s)]
*  After the verdict was read, Neely's father lashed out at Penny's supporters in the courtroom [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=191.14s)]
*  and was asked to leave. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=195.77999999999997s)]
*  He spoke to reporters outside. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=197.33999999999997s)]
*  I miss my son. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=199.22s)]
*  My son didn't have to go through this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  I didn't have to go through this either. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=207.22s)]
*  Really, really hurts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=208.22s)]
*  It's a busy scene here at the Tel Aviv courthouse. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=221.33999999999997s)]
*  We've got protesters out front protesting against Netanyahu. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  We've got his supporters protesting on his behalf and scores of journalists, TV cameras, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=230.45999999999998s)]
*  all trying to squeeze into an underground courtroom that is being used specifically [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  for the prime minister's testimony. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=244.42s)]
*  My colleague Patrick Kingsley is in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=246.42s)]
*  is testifying today in his corruption trial that's been delayed multiple times, stretching [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=250.86s)]
*  on for years. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=256.74s)]
*  Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, fraud, and breach of trust for allegedly granting [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=258.74s)]
*  political and diplomatic favors in exchange for gifts and positive media coverage. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=263.7s)]
*  This trial began back in 2020, but it was temporarily paused because of the pandemic [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  and the war in Gaza. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=274.38s)]
*  Patrick said that if he's convicted, Netanyahu, who's denied any wrongdoing, could face several [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=276.3s)]
*  years in prison. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=281.74s)]
*  In some senses, it's a dramatic moment to have the country's sitting prime minister [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=283.5s)]
*  in the courthouse answering lawyers' questions in the middle of a war. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  On the other hand, it's also become slightly normalized in Israeli society. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=293.62s)]
*  The question of the prime minister's guilt has been preoccupying Israeli politics for [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=298.98s)]
*  years now. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=305.98s)]
*  Most Israelis have decided on what their position is on his guilt and what would have been unimaginable [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=308.1s)]
*  for a sitting prime minister to refuse to stand down, even as he's being invested for [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=316.3s)]
*  corruption has now been normalized. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=322.34s)]
*  TikTok is trying to fend off being banned in the U.S., but it's running out of time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=328.94s)]
*  The company asked a federal court yesterday to temporarily freeze a law that requires [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=340.5s)]
*  the app to be sold off by January 19th or face a ban. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=345.5s)]
*  The law was passed earlier this year, with lawmakers citing national security concerns [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=350.62s)]
*  about TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=355.46s)]
*  They raised questions about how Americans' data could be used or if the app's algorithm [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=358.97999999999996s)]
*  could be leveraged for propaganda purposes. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=363.73999999999995s)]
*  TikTok has denied any such concerns and said the ban will violate the First Amendment rights [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=366.85999999999996s)]
*  of the more than 170 million Americans who use the app. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=372.62s)]
*  The company's latest legal request comes after it just lost an attempt to overturn the law [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=377.06s)]
*  in appeals court last week. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=382.02s)]
*  Now it's asking that the law be frozen until either the Supreme Court can take up the case [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=384.38s)]
*  or until Donald Trump takes office. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=389.34s)]
*  Right now the law is set to kick in the day before Trump's inaugurated, but he has said [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=392.38s)]
*  he would rescue the app, so TikTok is trying to buy time. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=396.9s)]
*  Some TikTok influencers are getting nervous, though. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=401.86s)]
*  They've been asking fans to follow them on Instagram and YouTube instead, just in case. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=404.7s)]
*  And talent agents have been telling TikTok stars to hold off on any big purchases, like [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=409.82s)]
*  buying a house, until the future of the app is more clear. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=414.58s)]
*  And finally, this week, researchers at Google have announced they're one step closer to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  a revolution in computing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=430.38s)]
*  They unveiled their new quantum computer and said that in their experiments, it needed [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=432.86s)]
*  less than five minutes to finish a calculation that one of the world's most powerful supercomputers [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=437.9s)]
*  couldn't finish in 10 septillion years. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  That's longer than the age of the known universe. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=448.02s)]
*  The difference is in how the computers operate. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=451.34s)]
*  While traditional computers store information as ones and zeros, quantum computers are built [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=454.26s)]
*  around tiny particles that can hold a combination of ones and zeros at the same time. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=459.94s)]
*  That gives quantum computers exponentially more processing power. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=465.66s)]
*  And while scientists say it will take years to refine the technology enough to actually [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=469.42s)]
*  be useful, they'll eventually be able to do things like supercharge AI systems and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=473.78000000000003s)]
*  accelerate research into new medicines. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=478.82000000000005s)]
*  Google is just one of many companies racing toward that goal, and governments are pouring [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=481.74s)]
*  billions of dollars into the effort. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=486.54s)]
*  One expert told The Times that new developments in quantum computing mean the technology is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=489.3s)]
*  quote, no longer science fiction. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=493.82s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=500.5s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=502.18s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh8rOE741d0&t=503.42s)]
