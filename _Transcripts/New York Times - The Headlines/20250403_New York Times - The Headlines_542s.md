# A Global Backlash to Trump’s Tariffs, and Deep Cuts to Public Health
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=4.84s)]
*  Today's Thursday, April 3rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=5.84s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=7.76s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=13.92s)]
*  President Trump's announcement of universal tariffs is a major blow to the world economy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=16.2s)]
*  Across the globe this morning, there's shock, confusion and vows of retaliation as world [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=23.12s)]
*  leaders respond to President Trump's dramatic new tariffs. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=28.16s)]
*  Let's be clear-eyed about the immense consequences. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=31.88s)]
*  The global economy will massively suffer. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=35.84s)]
*  Uncertainty will spiral. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=39.56s)]
*  And the tariffs will also hurt consumers around the world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=41.8s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen, a top European Union official, didn't even wait for the sun to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=44.92s)]
*  come up before condemning the tariffs. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  At a 5 a.m. news conference, she said Europe is already preparing countermeasures. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  If you take on one of us, you take on all of us. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=57.56s)]
*  Trump announced the tariffs against the EU and nearly all of America's other trading [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  partners yesterday afternoon at the White House. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=66.8s)]
*  My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  He framed the issue as a national emergency, claiming America is being taken advantage [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  of. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=78.08s)]
*  Foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=79.2s)]
*  foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=85.04s)]
*  The tariffs will take effect starting this weekend. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=89.96s)]
*  There will be a baseline 10 percent surcharge on nearly all products imported into the U.S., [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=92.8s)]
*  though products from some countries will face rates closer to 50 percent. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=98.44s)]
*  While some economists say that Trump is fundamentally right that some of America's trade relationships [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=103.2s)]
*  have been uneven, many warn that these kinds of broad tariffs will mean higher costs for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=107.88s)]
*  American consumers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=113.76s)]
*  Everything from smartphones to sneakers to air conditioners could get more expensive [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=115.72000000000001s)]
*  as the tariffs kick in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=120.12s)]
*  There was also immediate fallout. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=121.84s)]
*  The value of the U.S. dollar slumped even as Trump was announcing his plan. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=124.04s)]
*  And this morning, the stock markets in Europe and Asia have dropped sharply over fears about [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  the disruption the tariffs will cause. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=133.8s)]
*  It's like complete shock. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=136.0s)]
*  Like the words that people have been using when I asked them are shell shock, madness. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=137.88s)]
*  Everyone's just trying to get their hands around it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=144.16s)]
*  Like there's just like a ton of emergency meetings that are happening at the government [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=145.68s)]
*  and corporate level. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=149.6s)]
*  My colleague, Damian Cave, covers global affairs for the Times. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=150.92s)]
*  Trump is basically trying to redraw the map of the global economy and he's pitching it [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=154.2s)]
*  as something that will basically bring the United States roaring back and all the jobs [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=159.72s)]
*  and all the manufacturing will flow back into the United States. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=164.0s)]
*  But it's just nowhere near that simple. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  What we know from the tariffs that Trump put in place in his first term, which hit China [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=169.55999999999997s)]
*  pretty hard and moved a lot of companies into other parts of Southeast Asia, is that jobs [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  don't necessarily come back to the United States. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=178.92s)]
*  In many cases, they just move elsewhere around the world where it's affordable and cheaper [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  than it is actually to produce them in the United States, even with tariffs applied. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=185.44s)]
*  So, you know, this is a moment of extreme global disruption that will play out for many, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  many years in ways that are likely to be very unpredictable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=194.36s)]
*  For more on the tariffs, listen to today's episode of The Daily. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=199.56s)]
*  This week, the Trump administration began carrying out the layoffs of 10,000 federal [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=207.96s)]
*  health workers from the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  More than 2,000 of those layoffs happened at the country's top public health agency, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=216.24s)]
*  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=221.56s)]
*  The CDC has been a target of many conservatives since the pandemic when they criticized its [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=224.4s)]
*  response to COVID. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  But the cuts have gone beyond that, hitting across the entire agency and gutting whole [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  offices dedicated to things like reproductive health or gun violence prevention. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=235.68s)]
*  They've also hit scientists who are studying the health effects of smoking, lead poisoning [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=240.52s)]
*  and sexually transmitted diseases, among many other issues. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  The experts that I've been talking to, some of whom actually led the CDC and were involved [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=248.44000000000003s)]
*  in senior leadership roles, say that this is really a dismantling of the public health [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=253.12s)]
*  system. This isn't just a reorganizing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=258.2s)]
*  A poor from Mandeville covers public health for the Times. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=260.48s)]
*  What's clear from looking at some of the cuts is that the people who will be most affected [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=263.32s)]
*  are people who are poor, who live in rural areas, who are people of color, because some [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=267.68s)]
*  of the units that were cut specifically help those populations with their health issues. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  For example, a part of the Division of Reproductive Health that was cut specifically helps [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=280.24s)]
*  minority populations deal with their maternal and child health issues. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=285.56s)]
*  You know, this is happening as we are already coping with multiple public health crises all [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=290.2s)]
*  over the country now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=294.48s)]
*  We have measles outbreaks. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=295.8s)]
*  We have a bird flu epidemic. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=297.68s)]
*  We have STDs that have been soaring and are really not showing big signs of coming down. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=299.8s)]
*  And so the CDC deals with all of those problems, and it's a bit difficult to imagine how [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=306.16s)]
*  it will do that work when it's been cut down so much. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=311.32s)]
*  The Times has learned that the Trump administration has also gutted the communications [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=316.68s)]
*  staff at multiple health agencies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=320.76s)]
*  Many of those employees made sure the public was aware of food and drug recalls, shared [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=323.56s)]
*  information about disease outbreaks, or helped explain complex scientific research in an [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=328.12s)]
*  accessible way. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=333.2s)]
*  The head of HHS, Robert F. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  Kennedy Jr., said he's cutting back on bloated bureaucracy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=336.44s)]
*  But an FDA spokeswoman who was laid off this week told the Times it's the complete opposite [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=340.64s)]
*  of the radical transparency that Kennedy promised when he took the job and that it's, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  quote, doing a disservice to the public. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=350.4s)]
*  A new study published this week in the journal Nature shows that getting vaccinated against [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=364.8s)]
*  shingles can reduce the risk of developing dementia. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  The research adds to the growing body of evidence that preventing some viral infections may [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=373.8s)]
*  help stave off cognitive decline. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=379.52s)]
*  Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox when you're a kid. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=382.68s)]
*  It can remain dormant in your nerve cells for years. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=387.24s)]
*  But as people age and their immune systems weaken, the virus can reactivate and cause [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=390.52s)]
*  symptoms like painful blisters. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  The study suggests shingles may also have lasting effects on brain function. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=398.12s)]
*  Researchers found that people who were vaccinated were 20 percent less likely to develop [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=403.12s)]
*  dementia over the next few years than people who were not vaccinated. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=408.4s)]
*  The findings could be relevant for millions of people. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=412.84s)]
*  In the U.S., about one in three adults gets shingles in their lifetime. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=415.76s)]
*  About a third of eligible adults have received the vaccine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=420.08s)]
*  And finally, here we go. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  A record shop owner in Canada had an old reel to reel tape sitting on his shelf for [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=433.76s)]
*  years collecting dust until he finally played it last month. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=438.68s)]
*  And out of the speakers came the Beatles. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=446.56s)]
*  Very Young Beatles. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=450.08s)]
*  The label on the cardboard box had said it was a Beatles demo tape, but the shop owner [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=455.64s)]
*  hadn't really believed it until he heard it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=460.44s)]
*  The tape had 15 songs on it, most of which were covers. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  It appears to be a rare recording from the Beatles' infamous audition for DECA Records [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  back in 1962, when basically no one knew who they were yet. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  Ringo wasn't even in the band. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=474.91999999999996s)]
*  The record label turned them down. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=477.12s)]
*  The top executive supposedly told them, quote, Guitar groups are on the way out. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=480.56s)]
*  Bootleg copies of their audition have popped up over the years, and the Beatles themselves [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=485.64s)]
*  released a few of the songs back in the 90s. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=489.76s)]
*  It's unclear exactly how the tape ended up at the shop. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=492.68s)]
*  The owner said before he listened to it, he would have happily sold it for 20 bucks. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  Now he's a little more attached to it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=500.44s)]
*  The news of the resurfaced tape comes on the heels of another big Beatles development. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  Director Sam Mendes is going to start filming four movies on the band, one from each [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  member's perspective. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=512.96s)]
*  And he announced the casting this week. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=514.4399999999999s)]
*  The biggest name, Paul Meskell, most recently of the Gladiator sequel, will play Paul [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVaWI4WciiE&t=516.92s)]
