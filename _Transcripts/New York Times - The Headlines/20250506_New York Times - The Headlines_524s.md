# Israel’s ‘Intensive’ Escalation, an Air Traffic Control Crisis, Inside the Met Gala | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=4.8s)]
*  Today is Tuesday, May 6th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=5.8s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=7.8s)]
*  In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is on the brink of an intensive [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=19.76s)]
*  escalation of the war in Gaza. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=25.04s)]
*  Yesterday, as military reservists across the country were called up, Netanyahu said a, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=27.48s)]
*  quote, forceful entry to Gaza would happen soon and that Gaza's entire population would [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=33.44s)]
*  be pushed into the southern part of the territory. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=38.6s)]
*  Over the course of the 18-month long war, many Gazans have already been forced to evacuate [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=41.56s)]
*  multiple times and 50,000 Palestinians have been killed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=46.08s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu described the escalation as an attempt to achieve the two objectives [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=50.32s)]
*  of the war, bringing home the remaining hostages and eradicating Hamas in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=56.68s)]
*  But here in Israel, there is significant concern about the plan and some skepticism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=63.92s)]
*  My colleague Michael Shear is reporting from Jerusalem. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=69.52s)]
*  He says that some see Netanyahu's announcement as a political move designed to appease far-right [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=72.2s)]
*  Israelis who've wanted the country to take more aggressive action in Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=77.6s)]
*  Beyond that, critics of Mr. Netanyahu question the entire premise of the operation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=82.0s)]
*  The Israeli government has not provided many details of exactly how the military operation [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=87.48s)]
*  would work and what it would look like. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=92.28s)]
*  But the critics say that the fact that there has already been an 18-month long war that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=94.54s)]
*  hasn't achieved the prime minister's goals makes them question why sending additional [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=100.12s)]
*  troops in now would make any difference. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  They argue it would be better to negotiate a final end to the war with Hamas that brings [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=109.4s)]
*  the hostages home and ends the hostilities for good. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=114.42s)]
*  Today in Washington, President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=122.64s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who's forcefully pushed back on President Trump's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=129.96s)]
*  threats toward Canada, will now meet with him. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=134.36s)]
*  He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=137.64s)]
*  It will be their first in-person meeting at the White House. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=141.76s)]
*  We didn't ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Carney was elected last week after running on a largely anti-Trump platform, defending [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=150.64s)]
*  Canada's economy and sovereignty after Trump imposed tariffs on the country and repeatedly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=155.56s)]
*  threatened to make Canada the 51st state. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Carney will now attempt a juggling act of keeping up that aggressive stance, trying [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=164.04s)]
*  to defuse the trade war that could undermine his country's economy, and not setting off [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=168.32s)]
*  Trump, who's lashed out at other world leaders. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=172.88s)]
*  How do you avoid an Oval Office ambush like we saw happen to President Zelensky? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=176.12s)]
*  Look, I go there with the expectation of constructive, difficult but constructive discussions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  That's the spirit of the conversation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, two more updates on the Trump administration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=195.0s)]
*  The Justice Department weighed in on a federal lawsuit that's aiming to limit access to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=198.76s)]
*  abortion pills yesterday and asked the judge to dismiss the case. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=203.2s)]
*  The dismissal request caught some by surprise, given that Trump and a number of his officials [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=208.32s)]
*  have forcefully opposed abortion rights. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=212.84s)]
*  The lawsuit was brought by several conservative attorneys general, who object to how the FDA's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=215.92s)]
*  made it easier in recent years to get the medication Mifepristone. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=220.96s)]
*  The government's dismissal request didn't get into the merits of that argument. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=225.0s)]
*  Instead, the filing just said the case had been brought in the wrong venue. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  One abortion law expert told the Times that the administration could just be buying time [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=233.24s)]
*  to figure out what their strategy on Mifepristone will be, or it could indicate that they're [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  trying to be politically cautious on abortion, potentially with the 2026 midterms in mind. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  And... [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=249.84s)]
*  What we thought we'd do is a self-deport, where we're going to pay each one a certain [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=250.64s)]
*  amount of money and we're going to get them a beautiful flight back to where they came from. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=254.84s)]
*  President Trump said his administration is offering $1,000 and a flight home to undocumented [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=260.96s)]
*  immigrants who willingly leave the United States. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=266.36s)]
*  Administration officials say it will save the government money by avoiding the costs [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=269.76s)]
*  of arresting and detaining people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=274.0s)]
*  They say one migrant already took them up on the offer and flew from Chicago back to Honduras. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=276.2s)]
*  The administration says it's deported around 140,000 migrants since January, so far far [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=281.52s)]
*  short of Trump's campaign promise to remove millions. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=287.2s)]
*  At one of the busiest airports in the U.S., Newark Liberty International, a chaotic mix [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=299.48s)]
*  of factors has caused widespread disruptions and prompted safety concerns. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=304.52s)]
*  The issues began last Monday when air traffic controllers temporarily lost all radar contact [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  and communications with planes there, reportedly for 90 seconds. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  The situation was so stressful that some of the controllers then took time off of work [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  under a law allowing federal employees who've experienced a traumatic event on the job to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=325.28s)]
*  take leave. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said that, quote, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our workforce. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=334.6s)]
*  With the air traffic control center understaffed, United Airlines, Newark's largest carrier, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  then said it was cutting 35 flights per day from its schedule there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=345.32000000000005s)]
*  That's added to the headaches for travelers, with the airport already under strain from [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  bad weather this week and construction on one of its runways. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=353.36s)]
*  The staffing shortages hitting Newark are part of a nationwide crisis. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=357.08s)]
*  More than 90% of the country's air traffic control facilities are operating below recommended [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=361.56s)]
*  levels. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=366.76s)]
*  Last week, the transportation department started promoting $5,000 hiring bonuses to try and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  fill those gaps. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=372.64s)]
*  Speaking of air travel, starting tomorrow, for anyone flying in the U.S., just pulling [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=378.24s)]
*  out your old driver's license might not do it anymore. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  You will need a real ID, the enhanced identification, or you'll need a passport or other federal [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=386.32s)]
*  document. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=391.96s)]
*  Yes, you heard this two years ago, and a few years before that, and a few years before [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=392.96s)]
*  that, going back almost two decades. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=398.0s)]
*  But after repeatedly extending the deadline, the government is now firm. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=400.12s)]
*  Tomorrow is it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=404.0s)]
*  So if you haven't done it yet, you might want to get in line now. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=405.24s)]
*  People have been flooding into their local DMVs to try and get their real IDs. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=408.48s)]
*  And finally. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=417.28s)]
*  I am currently standing inside the Met for one of the biggest nights in style and fashion. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=418.28s)]
*  Everyone is here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=425.08s)]
*  Spike Lee, Meg Thee Stallion, Serena Williams. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=426.28s)]
*  My colleague, Sandra Garcia, was at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last night covering the Met [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=429.56s)]
*  Gala. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=433.4s)]
*  Andre 3000 just walked in with a piano attached to his back. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=434.4s)]
*  The annual fundraiser that gets likened to the Super Bowl of Fashion. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=437.84s)]
*  The scene this year is super fine. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=441.96s)]
*  Black fashion. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=445.08s)]
*  It focuses on dandyism or the art of using your clothes to assert your dignity, using [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=447.56s)]
*  your clothes as armor, especially for Black people, and how that has created style and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=455.24s)]
*  fashion. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=462.84s)]
*  The event raised a record $31 million for the museum, though, as always, it was the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=464.32s)]
*  outfits getting all the attention. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=470.0s)]
*  It's not just a night for a gown or a tux, but for going all out with sculptural sky-high [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=472.4s)]
*  headpieces or an 18-foot long feathered train like disco queen Diana Ross was rocking last [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  night. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=485.23999999999995s)]
*  The Times has collected the 15 most distinctive looks from the Gala. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=486.23999999999995s)]
*  There are snakes, pearls, a bowling bag, big, big, big bows, and what's being called the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=490.08s)]
*  color of spring, butter yellow. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtzVcHsWGJ4&t=497.47999999999996s)]
