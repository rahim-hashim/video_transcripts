# Elon Musk’s Drug Use, Uncertainty on Trump’s Tariffs, and Our Friday News Quiz | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Friday, May 30th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=7.76s)]
*  Today President Trump said he's going to hold a press conference at the White House [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=14.36s)]
*  to say goodbye to Elon Musk. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=17.96s)]
*  Musk's been talking about his departure from the administration for weeks, wrapping up [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=21.04s)]
*  his role that's been unlike any in the history of American government. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=25.28s)]
*  The world's richest man, Musk wielded a huge amount of influence in the White House, though [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=29.92s)]
*  he was never confirmed by the Senate to any official cabinet position. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=35.440000000000005s)]
*  He was the face of Trump's federal spending cuts with his Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=39.84s)]
*  gleefully talking about feeding programs into the woodchipper, and he faced backlash from [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=45.24s)]
*  the public for it, too. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=50.56s)]
*  Marking his exit, Trump wrote, quote, This will be his last day, but not really, because [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=52.72s)]
*  he will always be with us, helping all the way. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=57.64s)]
*  Elon is terrific. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=60.68s)]
*  As Musk leaves Washington, the Times has learned new details about his drug use when he first [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=62.84s)]
*  joined President Trump on the campaign trail. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=68.64s)]
*  While Musk was stumping for Trump, jumping around on stage at rallies and donating about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  $275 million to the campaign, he was doing drugs far more intensely than previously known. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=78.2s)]
*  As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm Dark MAGA. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=86.16s)]
*  He took ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=89.44s)]
*  He told people he was having health issues that matched side effects associated with [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  chronic ketamine use, and he traveled with a daily medication box that held about 20 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=96.46s)]
*  pills, including ones with the markings of the stimulant Adderall. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=102.28s)]
*  It's unclear whether Musk continued taking drugs when he started working at the White [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=106.24s)]
*  House and was given the authority to reshape the federal government, but he did exhibit [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=109.97999999999999s)]
*  erratic and troubling behavior, insulting cabinet members, garbling his answers in an [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=115.2s)]
*  interview and gesturing like a Nazi. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=120.34s)]
*  Musk has previously said he takes ketamine for depression, though he didn't respond [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=123.84s)]
*  to requests from the Times for comment. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  The White House also didn't respond when asked if Musk had to take drug tests as part [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=130.46s)]
*  of his role. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=135.18s)]
*  Now three more updates on the Trump administration. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=143.36s)]
*  A court ruling blocking President Trump's steep tariffs was in place for less than 24 [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  hours before a separate court paused that decision yesterday, sowing even more confusion [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=151.72000000000003s)]
*  for American consumers and the global economy. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=157.56s)]
*  The tariffs will remain in effect while a panel of judges now decides whether the president [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=160.96s)]
*  had the power to single-handedly impose the surcharges. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  In the meantime, Trump officials have been intensifying their attacks on judges who rule [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=169.52s)]
*  against the administration's policies. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=174.28s)]
*  White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said America cannot function if the president [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=183.8s)]
*  is being, quote, railroaded by activist judges. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=188.88s)]
*  Two of the trade court judges who originally found the tariffs were illegal are Republican [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  appointees. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=197.76s)]
*  One was named to the bench by Trump himself. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=199.2s)]
*  Also, when the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again commission released [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=202.64s)]
*  a report last week on children's health issues, it called this generation the sickest [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=208.2s)]
*  in American history and said its findings were, quote, evidence-based foundation for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  taking action. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=218.84s)]
*  But it's now become clear the report cited studies that do not exist. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=220.6s)]
*  That included fictitious research about drug advertising, mental illness, and medications [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=225.32s)]
*  for children with asthma. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=230.04s)]
*  One expert on medical journalism said the errors were characteristic of what happens [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  when you use artificial intelligence, though it's unclear if the commission relied on [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=236.5s)]
*  that technology. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=240.88s)]
*  The report has since been reposted with corrections. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=241.88s)]
*  And, at the Department of Homeland Security... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=245.72s)]
*  I have not been satisfied with the numbers. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  Christine Noem, Steve Miller, myself, we all want more numbers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=251.8s)]
*  So we expect a fast increase in number of arrests every day. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  Several top officials have left their jobs, part of a shakeup in leadership as the Trump [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=258.68s)]
*  administration pressures the department to ramp up deportations. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=263.04s)]
*  The White House says immigration authorities have been arresting about 700 people a day, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  but it's aiming to get that number up to 3,000. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=272.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, The Times has been reporting on how the administration's aggressive crackdown [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  is affecting immigrant communities, in particular farm workers, many of whom are undocumented. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=281.2s)]
*  My colleague Anna Lei recently traveled to rural upstate New York to talk with some of them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  There's been a lot of anxiety these past few months. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=292.4s)]
*  People have been staying home a lot more than they would otherwise. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=295.9s)]
*  They have been avoiding going to the grocery store. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=300.56s)]
*  They've been avoiding going to church. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=304.2s)]
*  They told me they won't even sometimes get ice cream with their children. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=306.66s)]
*  This fear that people have is heightened by the fact that they are living in a place where [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  a lot of voters are Trump supporters. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=317.86s)]
*  And a lot of people there seem to want these deportations to happen. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=321.5s)]
*  There is this fear that people are going to get turned in by their neighbors. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=327.18s)]
*  And there is evidence that this happened. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=331.26000000000005s)]
*  I spoke with a man whose wife hit a deer while she was driving in a snowstorm. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=334.14s)]
*  She knocked on a neighbor's door for help. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=340.06s)]
*  And instead of getting help, the neighbor called the authorities and reported her for [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=342.94s)]
*  suspicious activity. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=349.4s)]
*  And she was taken away by ice. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=351.2s)]
*  What's happening in upstate New York is happening in farming communities all across the country. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=355.46s)]
*  It's happening in California. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=360.78s)]
*  It's happening in Texas. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=362.58s)]
*  Farm workers will hear about people getting picked up by the authorities. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=364.53999999999996s)]
*  So they'll go into hiding. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=367.7s)]
*  And then they come out when they're ready to live their lives again. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=369.96s)]
*  Then they'll hear about more activity involving law enforcement. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=373.0s)]
*  So a lot of them told me they're caught in this cycle of fear and anxiety. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=376.67999999999995s)]
*  This Sunday is the start of Pride Month, which will be marked by parades and festivals in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=380.54s)]
*  cities around the country celebrating the LGBTQ community. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=395.38s)]
*  In years past, companies big and small had jumped on board to sponsor these events, clamoring [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=399.58000000000004s)]
*  to have their logos splashed on t-shirts and banners. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=404.82000000000005s)]
*  But this year, many companies have backed away. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  New York Pride has had a quarter of its sponsors drop out or scale back, including Garnier, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=411.62s)]
*  SkyVodka and MasterCard, which were all platinum sponsors last year. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=417.06s)]
*  Target is still participating, but asked for that to go unpublicized. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=421.94s)]
*  And in San Francisco, Anheuser-Busch, which had been one of the largest sponsors of Pride [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=426.66s)]
*  there, told the executive director earlier this year it would not be providing funding. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=431.42s)]
*  The company said it was no longer in their budget. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=435.94s)]
*  Other companies have also cited economic uncertainty. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=438.66s)]
*  But Pride organizers see another factor. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=441.82s)]
*  The Trump administration's crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion programs. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=444.9s)]
*  The head of Milwaukee Pride said corporations he talked to worried they might be penalized [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=450.22s)]
*  or punished by the government, saying, quote, everyone's afraid. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=454.98s)]
*  One specialist in LGBTQ marketing told the Times, corporations have actually been getting [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=459.6s)]
*  nervous for a few years, as there's been growing backlash to the increased visibility [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=464.46s)]
*  of LGBTQ Americans. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=469.46s)]
*  But this year's drop in sponsorship has added fuel to criticism that corporations only support [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=471.9s)]
*  the LGBTQ community when there's a financial benefit, a practice some dismiss as rainbow [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=477.74s)]
*  capitalism. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=484.29999999999995s)]
*  And finally. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=490.78s)]
*  Whose boss? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=491.78s)]
*  It's Houshou Ryu versus Onosato. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=492.78s)]
*  This week, the world of sumo wrestling named a new Yokosuna or grand champion, the highest [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=496.85999999999996s)]
*  title awarded in the sport. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=502.61999999999995s)]
*  Onosato, as he's known, is a 24 year old who weighs in at 420 pounds. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=504.78s)]
*  And his ascension is a huge win for Japan, which despite inventing sumo has lost its [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=512.26s)]
*  dominance in the last few decades. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=518.22s)]
*  Until the 90s, all Yokosuna were Japanese before Mongolian wrestlers started to rule [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=520.74s)]
*  the ring. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=526.22s)]
*  Onosato is just the second Japanese Yokosuna this century. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=527.22s)]
*  In Japan, sumo wrestling's been losing popularity. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=531.34s)]
*  It's gotten a reputation for being kind of old fashioned. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=534.82s)]
*  The rituals before a match, like bowing and foot stomping, actually last far longer than [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=537.98s)]
*  the match itself, which is over in just seconds. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=543.32s)]
*  Many younger Japanese people have turned to other sports instead, particularly soccer. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=546.94s)]
*  But some sumo fans are hoping Onosato can change that, dubbing him the savior of Japanese sumo. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=551.6s)]
*  Those are the headlines, but stick around, we've got the Friday news quiz for you after [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=561.9000000000001s)]

*  downfall of Trump's tariffs. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=571.82s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=573.9s)]

*  Now for the quiz. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=597.6999999999999s)]
*  All May, we have been giving you a chance to test your news knowledge on Fridays, and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=598.98s)]
*  we are going to keep it going into June as well. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=602.98s)]
*  So we've got questions about three stories the Times has covered this week. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=605.54s)]
*  Can you answer them all? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=610.1800000000001s)]
*  First up, the stock market surged earlier this week after President Trump pushed back [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=613.4200000000001s)]
*  the 50% tariffs he said he'd put on Europe. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=619.34s)]
*  It's a trend economists have taken note of. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=623.02s)]
*  Trump threatens high tariffs only to lower or delay them, sometimes within days. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=626.1s)]
*  That pattern has now even been given its own nickname. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=631.34s)]
*  Mr. President, Wall Street analysts have coined a new term called the taco trade. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=634.7s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=638.7800000000001s)]
*  The term taco trade is an acronym. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=640.2800000000001s)]
*  So your question, what does the taco in that stand for? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=643.1800000000001s)]
*  I'll give you a hint. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=651.94s)]
*  The T stands for Trump. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=652.94s)]
*  The answer is Trump always chickens out. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=661.46s)]
*  The phrase was first used by a columnist at the Financial Times. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=666.02s)]
*  OK, next question. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=670.5s)]
*  A team of British men set off a wave of controversy in the world of mountain climbing when they [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=674.38s)]
*  tested out a new way to summit Mount Everest this month. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=679.7s)]
*  I'm going to play you a clip of the organizer of the expedition describing the climb. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  You'll need to fill in what their key and very divisive innovation was. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=688.46s)]
*  The only reason why we are working with and why we are using this to make the climb safer. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=693.74s)]
*  We can see people dying on Everest every year and maybe one step to improve this situation [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=701.22s)]
*  and to make climbing high altitude mountains safer. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=709.0s)]
*  Can you tell me what the secret sauce was for their experiment? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=712.7800000000001s)]
*  The answer is xenon gas. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=718.46s)]
*  Leading up to the climb, about two weeks out, the team inhaled the gas, which effectively [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  tricked their bodies into thinking they were already at high altitude. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=732.9000000000001s)]
*  They were then able to get to the top of the world's highest mountain in less than three [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=736.9000000000001s)]
*  days without needing to acclimate, a process that would normally take weeks. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=740.5s)]
*  Interestingly, while very fast, three days is not the record. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=745.62s)]
*  According to the government of Nepal, the fastest climb of Everest ever was done in [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=749.6999999999999s)]
*  2003 by Lakpa Galu, a Sherpa who reached the summit in just under 11 hours. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=754.4599999999999s)]
*  Okay last question. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=764.14s)]
*  Your word is éclair-ci-small. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=765.98s)]
*  Last night was the final round of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, just celebrating its [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=769.9s)]
*  100th anniversary. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=774.86s)]
*  Eclair-ci-small. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=776.5s)]
*  E-C-L-A-I-R-C-I-S-S-E-M-E-N-T. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=777.5s)]
*  That is correct! [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=787.5s)]
*  The winner was 13-year-old Faisanzaki from Texas who won the competition and its prize [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=789.38s)]
*  of $50,000. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=794.7s)]
*  Now we're going to test your spelling skills. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=795.7s)]
*  We're going to back up a few rounds to do that since you already know how to spell éclair-ci-small. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=799.34s)]
*  So I will give you a word from the semi-finals. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=804.98s)]
*  Your word is quern. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=807.4200000000001s)]
*  Quern is a noun. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=810.74s)]
*  This word is originally English. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=812.02s)]
*  Quern means a simple mill for grinding grain consisting of two circular stones with the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=814.02s)]
*  upper one being turned by hand. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=818.1s)]
*  Okay can you spell quern? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=821.3000000000001s)]
*  I feel like your brow may be furrowing. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=824.54s)]
*  Okay time is up. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=832.66s)]
*  I'm going to let fifth grader Sarv Dharavne who came in third give you the answer. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=833.66s)]
*  Quern. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=839.74s)]
*  Q-U-E-R-N. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=840.74s)]
*  Quern. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=841.74s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq-3WPqg3c&t=842.74s)]
