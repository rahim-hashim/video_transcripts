# A Showdown on Ukraine, and a Judge Says DOGE Might Be Unconstitutional
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Today is Tuesday, February 25th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=5.84s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=8.0s)]
*  The way we answer to the Russian aggression today, it will define our common future, the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=14.0s)]
*  future of the entire democratic world and the future of the UN. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=21.44s)]
*  At the United Nations yesterday, there was a diplomatic showdown between the US and some [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=25.34s)]
*  of its closest allies over the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=29.56s)]
*  Delegates were meeting on the third anniversary of Russia's invasion, and Ukraine put forward [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=33.68s)]
*  a resolution condemning Russia's actions and calling on it to pull back its troops. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=38.4s)]
*  It had the backing of countries like Britain and France, but the US refused to support [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=43.4s)]
*  it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=49.08s)]
*  Multiple resolutions of the General Assembly have failed to stop the war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=50.08s)]
*  It has now dragged on for far too long. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=54.84s)]
*  Instead, American representatives pushed through a short resolution of their own that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=57.92s)]
*  called for an end to the war without assigning blame and mourned the loss of life on both [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  sides of the conflict. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=67.44s)]
*  European diplomats said they were furious that the US, their longtime ally, had sided [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=69.92s)]
*  against them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  And as the US and Europe split played out at the UN, their growing rift was also on [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=76.92s)]
*  display at the White House. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=82.08000000000001s)]
*  French President Emmanuel Macron met one-on-one with President Trump. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=86.0s)]
*  There were hugs and handshakes and compliments, but Macron also pushed back on Trump's framing [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=90.32s)]
*  of the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=95.6s)]
*  Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=97.0s)]
*  They get their money back. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=99.72s)]
*  No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=100.72s)]
*  We paid 60 percent of the total default. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=104.2s)]
*  In one exchange, Macron cut Trump off to fact-check his false claim that European countries were [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=106.68s)]
*  only helping Ukraine because they expected to be reimbursed. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=111.88s)]
*  Macron's team had scrambled to organize the D.C. visit amid Trump's increasingly hostile [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=116.04s)]
*  stance towards Europe. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=121.04s)]
*  It came as other leaders are also rushing to Washington. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=122.96s)]
*  Over the weekend, the Polish president attended the conservative convention CPAC to try and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=126.52s)]
*  influence the new administration. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=130.84s)]
*  The prime minister of Britain will visit the White House this Thursday. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=133.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Times has learned that the U.S. and Ukraine are pushing forward on a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=136.84s)]
*  massive new economic deal. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=146.0s)]
*  It would give the U.S. a large share of the profits from Ukraine's natural resources [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=148.68s)]
*  like lithium. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=153.16s)]
*  It was originally Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's idea. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=154.7s)]
*  He wanted to trade the country's valuable natural resources for future U.S. military [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=158.36s)]
*  support. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=163.12s)]
*  Trump is pushing a very different deal. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=164.24s)]
*  Essentially, Donald Trump has turned the concept on its head and said that he wants the minerals [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=166.88s)]
*  and other natural resources such as oil and gas as compensation for past American aid [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=174.16s)]
*  with no thing in return for Ukraine. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=180.76s)]
*  Constant Meillet covers Ukraine for the Times and has gotten access to drafts of the agreement. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=184.56s)]
*  He says right now the sticking point will be what kind of security guarantee, if any, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=189.72s)]
*  the U.S. is willing to provide. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=195.04s)]
*  And so the Ukrainians and the Americans have been haggling over what Ukraine could get [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=197.32s)]
*  in return. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=203.7s)]
*  The argument at the White House has been that the mere presence of American economic interest [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=204.82s)]
*  in Ukraine would deter future Russian aggression. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=210.18s)]
*  The idea is that if you have American businesses on the ground, the Russians will not dare [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=214.16s)]
*  to attack. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=219.32s)]
*  But President Zelensky has countered that there were American businesses on the ground [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=220.32s)]
*  prior to the Russian full-scale invasion, and that did not deter the Russians' attack. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=225.04s)]
*  Yesterday, a federal judge said that the way Elon Musk's cost-cutting team, the Department [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=237.48s)]
*  of Government Efficiency, was set up may be unconstitutional. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=242.28s)]
*  The judge said she was concerned that Doge violates a clause in the Constitution that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=246.84s)]
*  requires leaders of federal agencies to be confirmed by the Senate, which Musk has not [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=251.56s)]
*  been. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=256.44s)]
*  She also indicated she has serious concerns about how Doge is being run and who is technically [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=257.44s)]
*  in charge. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=262.2s)]
*  A lawyer for the government told her he was unable to identify who's actually running [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=263.48s)]
*  it and said he didn't have any details about Musk's specific role. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=267.42s)]
*  The judge said, quote, if you have people that are not authorized to carry out some [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  of these functions that they're carrying out, that does raise an issue. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=275.98s)]
*  Her remarks came as part of a case challenging Doge's attempts to access sensitive data [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=280.3s)]
*  at the Treasury Department. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=284.74s)]
*  They're not part of any binding ruling, but they suggest there could be legal problems [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=286.5s)]
*  ahead for Musk's team. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=290.22s)]
*  A new report reveals how North Korea has been sending its own citizens overseas as forced [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=298.62s)]
*  labor to bring in money for the regime. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=304.46s)]
*  The report from the Environmental Justice Foundation found that North Koreans have been [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=307.46s)]
*  forced to work on Chinese fishing boats thousands of miles from home. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=311.53999999999996s)]
*  Some of the workers have been effectively trapped on the ocean for almost a decade. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  They've had their passports confiscated, they have no cell phones, and most of their [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  salaries go directly to North Korea's government. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=324.02s)]
*  The boats catch tuna, which is sold to markets across Asia and even as far away as Europe [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=327.34s)]
*  and the United Kingdom. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=332.5s)]
*  It's part of a shadowy labor practice in which dozens of countries around the world [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=334.14s)]
*  benefit from forced North Korean labor. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=338.12s)]
*  North Korea has sent people to work in factories and restaurants in China. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=341.3s)]
*  Others work in Russian logging and construction. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=345.22s)]
*  And there are laborers in the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=348.18s)]
*  In all, the UN estimates that more than 100,000 North Koreans are working abroad for the regime. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=351.9s)]
*  And finally, Roberta Flack, the virtuoso singer and pianist, has died at 88 years old. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=364.5s)]
*  She was best known for her powerful performances of achingly slow songs. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=383.98s)]
*  Though she started playing the piano from the time she was small, she didn't hit it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=389.34s)]
*  big until much later. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=392.9s)]
*  She worked as a teacher into her 30s. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=394.5s)]
*  At one point I was teaching physical education and I taught math classes, I taught English [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  classes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=402.17999999999995s)]
*  Which is waste, I guess. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=403.17999999999995s)]
*  No, not a waste, but not music. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=404.17999999999995s)]
*  Flack played her early gigs around Washington, D.C. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=406.78s)]
*  I decided to stop teaching school after I had worked for the summer as a singer at a [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=409.78s)]
*  little club on Capitol Hill where a lot of senators came with their families on Sundays [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=416.34s)]
*  and it was also a gay bar. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=421.94s)]
*  Her regular performances at a club called Mr. Henry's caught the attention of everyone [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=424.54s)]
*  from Liberace to record executives. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=428.5s)]
*  And she became a superstar after Clint Eastwood featured her music in one of his movies. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=431.34s)]
*  But it was her next big hit in 1973 that made her the most listened to artist of the era. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=436.3s)]
*  Killing Me Softly became her signature song, which she performed for decades, including [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=441.3s)]
*  with the Fugees on their 90s remix of it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=454.74s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=471.74s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Time's tech reporter Cashmere Hill on the story of how one woman [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=473.02000000000004s)]
*  fell in love, deeply romantically in love, with a chatbot. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=477.46000000000004s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=481.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=485.90000000000003s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfJlqHfaTs&t=486.90000000000003s)]
