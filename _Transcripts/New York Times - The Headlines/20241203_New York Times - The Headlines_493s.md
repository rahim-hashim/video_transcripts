# White House Defends Pardon, and Israel and Hezbollah Trade Fire
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, December 3rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=7.76s)]
*  One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because it didn't seem like his political [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=10.16s)]
*  opponents would let go of it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  It didn't seem like they would move on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  And so this is why this president took this action. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=23.64s)]
*  The White House is on defense, fielding questions about why President Biden pardoned his son [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=26.52s)]
*  Hunter after repeatedly promising not to do so. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Hunter Biden was singled out because his dad is the president. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=35.6s)]
*  That's what we're talking about here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=40.08s)]
*  On Air Force One yesterday, White House press secretary, Kareen Jean-Pierre, repeated Biden's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=42.0s)]
*  explanation that he felt the cases against his son were politically motivated. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=46.86s)]
*  Read the president's statement. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=51.72s)]
*  Seriously, read the president's statement. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=52.72s)]
*  But Biden's statement has raised questions about the standing of the Justice Department. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=55.28s)]
*  What does it mean for the president to openly criticize its process? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=60.28s)]
*  He believes in the Justice Department. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=64.04s)]
*  He believes that there was... [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=65.76s)]
*  After saying all that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=66.76s)]
*  He believes in the Justice Department? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=67.76s)]
*  This is his words. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=68.76s)]
*  He said this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=69.76s)]
*  This is the president saying this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=70.76s)]
*  He just said it's infected with politics. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=71.76s)]
*  Biden's continued explanation for the pardon in some ways echoes claims that Donald Trump [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=74.76s)]
*  has made, that federal investigations were weaponized against him, and that the justice [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=80.84s)]
*  system is unfair. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=85.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, some legal experts have been noting how broad the pardon is for Hunter Biden. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=88.84s)]
*  It covers not just the tax charges that he pleaded guilty to and the gun charges he [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=98.12s)]
*  was convicted of, but also any crimes he might have committed in the past 11 years. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=102.28s)]
*  Notably, that range covers the time when Hunter Biden was conducting business overseas with [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  a Ukrainian gas company, a Chinese energy company, and more. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=113.6s)]
*  Our reporting shows that this is something that prosecutors did look into, that is Hunter [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  Biden's foreign business and the possibility that it may have violated foreign lobbying [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=122.1s)]
*  laws. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=127.24s)]
*  And they actually indicated that they had evidence that could potentially support a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=128.24s)]
*  charge of violation of foreign lobbying laws, but they did not bring those charges. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=132.96s)]
*  Ken Bogle covers politics for the Times. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=139.52s)]
*  Yet the possibility that that evidence and that investigation could be revived was clearly [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  something that the Bidens, Hunter Biden, his lawyers, as well as the president, were acutely [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=149.0s)]
*  and may have been wanting to short circuit the possibility of through this pardon. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=156.16s)]
*  The Supreme Court is a very secretive institution, and there is a lot we don't know about how [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  the justices debate and what they say to one another. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  But my colleague, Abby Van Sickle, and I, we uncovered a very unusual debate that the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=183.72s)]
*  justices had recently about their own conduct. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=189.68s)]
*  Times investigative reporter Jody Cantor has gotten new details about how the Supreme Court [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=194.56s)]
*  struggled behind closed doors to put an ethics code in place. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=199.48s)]
*  The court didn't have a code until revelations that Justice Clarence Thomas had accepted undisclosed [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=204.48s)]
*  gifts and luxury travel sparked outrage. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=209.88s)]
*  Interest to other justices came to light too, raising concerns about potential conflicts [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=213.2s)]
*  of interest. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  And so, under growing pressure, the nine justices started writing their own guidelines last [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  year. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=223.6s)]
*  Jody says the topic was so sensitive that they debated it on paper, passing envelopes [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=224.6s)]
*  back and forth instead of using email. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=229.01999999999998s)]
*  The Times has learned that their sharpest disagreements were about whether there should [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=231.72s)]
*  be a way to enforce the code. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=235.7s)]
*  The three liberal justices really believed that the rules needed to be more than symbolic [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=238.28s)]
*  and more than just promises. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=243.96s)]
*  Justice Elena Kagan even proposed a kind of starter version of enforcement in which federal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  judges would provide the justices with advice. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=253.72s)]
*  But her proposal really went nowhere. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=257.48s)]
*  Several justices, led by Justice Neil Gorsuch, were really worried that any kind of ethics [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=260.72s)]
*  enforcement, anybody essentially policing the judges, could undermine the independence [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=267.82s)]
*  of the court. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=274.7s)]
*  Ultimately, the justices unanimously signed an ethics code with no enforcement mechanism. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  They essentially policed themselves, and only they can decide if they need to step back [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=282.6s)]
*  from a case. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=287.06s)]
*  Since then, Jody says that the justices' heated debate about enforcement has spilled [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=288.98s)]
*  out into the open, and those public disagreements outside the courtroom are raising new concerns [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=293.3s)]
*  about public trust in the court. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=299.06s)]
*  Her full investigation is at nytimes.com. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=300.98s)]
*  In the Middle East, Israel and Hezbollah have both been pushing the limits of the ceasefire [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=309.26s)]
*  they agreed to less than a week ago. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=313.94s)]
*  Both sides have carried out strikes and accused the other of violating the truce. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  Israel has repeatedly bombed sites in Lebanon and Hezbollah hit back yesterday with its [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=322.14s)]
*  first strikes against Israeli-controlled territory. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=327.34s)]
*  Despite the flare-ups, analysts say that both sides have been keeping their attacks limited, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=330.9s)]
*  as they still think it's in their best interest to avoid spiraling back into an all-out war. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  One former Middle East negotiator at the State Department told the Times that this kind of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=341.26s)]
*  smaller back-and-forth is not unusual, saying, quote, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  I've been around Lebanon's ceasefire agreements for decades, and there was no ceasefire agreement [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=349.58s)]
*  that wasn't initially broken. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=354.74s)]
*  And finally, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=366.38s)]
*  What kind of reaction have you gotten from people along your route? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=367.38s)]
*  Oh, people love it. They love it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=371.38s)]
*  You know, it looks funny, but it's cool. It's real cool looking. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=374.38s)]
*  The United States Postal Service is rolling out its new fleet of mail trucks, and they are turning heads. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=378.38s)]
*  The classic boxy mail truck is out, and the new look is, it's a little hard to describe. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=385.38s)]
*  It's a little cartoony, touch goofy. It's got some golf cart elements. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=391.38s)]
*  It's got a gigantic windshield and a long low hood. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=395.38s)]
*  I know a lot of people say it looks funny. It looks like a Doug or a Platypus. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=398.38s)]
*  It does, but I tell them to get the job done. It works for me. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=403.38s)]
*  Richard Burton, a mail carrier in Athens, Georgia, said, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=407.38s)]
*  Platypus comparisons aside, the best thing about the new trucks is the air conditioning, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=410.38s)]
*  an absolute must in the South. He was surviving before with just a fan. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=415.38s)]
*  There's also a lot more space in the back for packages, which online shopping has made essential. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=421.38s)]
*  The Postal Service has ordered 50,000 of the new trucks, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=427.38s)]
*  and they are a long overdue relief for mail carriers who haven't had an upgrade in the fleet since the 1980s. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=430.38s)]
*  The new model is also electric. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=437.38s)]
*  Another mail carrier in Georgia, Wykelar Barnes, told my colleague Michael Levinson, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=439.38s)]
*  she couldn't even tell that her truck was running because it was so quiet. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=443.38s)]
*  But she said on the street, the truck is hard to miss. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=447.38s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=470.38s)]
*  Today on The Daily, White House correspondent Peter Baker with the inside story of how Biden made the decision to pardon his son. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=472.38s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=480.38s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbikpF4JLQ&t=485.38s)]
