# A Fragile Israel-Hezbollah Truce, and a Push to Make You Love Plastic
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=4.88s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, November 27th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=8.52s)]
*  Just after 4 a.m. this morning, the skies above the Lebanese capital Beirut basically [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=15.6s)]
*  erupted in celebratory gunfire. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=20.68s)]
*  In fact, I can still hear it now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=23.28s)]
*  These people took to the streets to celebrate what was an end to a bloody year-long conflict [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=26.8s)]
*  and a brutal bombardment in and around the Lebanese capital. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=32.24s)]
*  My colleague Ewan Ward is in Beirut, where the ceasefire between Israel and the militant [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=36.9s)]
*  group Hezbollah went into effect early this morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=41.36s)]
*  Lebanese lawmakers still have to formally approve the deal today, but the fighting has [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=45.08s)]
*  already stopped. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  The truce is supposed to last for 60 days. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  The terms of the ceasefire call for Israel to pull its troops out of Lebanon over the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=53.8s)]
*  next two months, while Hezbollah is supposed to move its forces north, away from the Israeli [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  border. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=63.48s)]
*  There's bumper-to-bumper traffic heading south. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  There's thousands make their way back to their home villages, which they've been displaced [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=67.8s)]
*  from. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  This comes despite warnings by both the Lebanese military and Israeli military that they should [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=73.0s)]
*  wait. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=78.36s)]
*  The troops are obviously still deployed in the south, and it remains unclear exactly [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=79.36s)]
*  when they will withdraw and how long that might take. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=83.84s)]
*  Over the course of the fighting, nearly 4,000 people were killed and more than a million [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=86.76s)]
*  were displaced. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=91.48s)]
*  A vast majority of the casualties and displacements were on the Lebanese side. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=92.48s)]
*  Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=97.6s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=103.2s)]
*  They too deserve an end to the fighting and displacement. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=104.64s)]
*  While marking the start of this ceasefire, President Biden and other world leaders have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=108.36s)]
*  expressed hope the deal will build momentum toward a ceasefire in Gaza as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=112.96s)]
*  But The Times Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley says that analysts are skeptical [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=118.32s)]
*  of that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=122.6s)]
*  The Hezbollah deal was possible because the Lebanese militia was weakened by months of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=123.6s)]
*  assassinations of its leaders and battlefield losses, and it had essentially lost its leverage [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=131.48s)]
*  at the negotiating table. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=136.36s)]
*  These dynamics are not the case in Gaza, where a breakthrough is a lot harder because Hamas [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=138.52s)]
*  still has quite a strong negotiating position. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  Hamas has held out for 14 months, largely because it holds 100 hostages. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=147.8s)]
*  So that means it can hold out for its maximalist aims, which are to survive the war intact [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=154.12s)]
*  as the dominant power in Gaza and for Israel to withdraw from Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=161.3s)]
*  And on the Israeli side, Netanyahu has vowed to completely remove Hamas from power. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=166.62s)]
*  So striking any kind of deal with them would look like a failure to much of the Israeli [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=172.8s)]
*  electorate and in particular to his base and to his far-right governing allies and potentially [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=178.7s)]
*  threaten his grip on power. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=186.88s)]
*  Donald Trump has continued to fill out the public health leadership for his next administration, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=191.22s)]
*  naming Dr. J. Bhattacharya to be the director of the National Institutes of Health. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=203.74s)]
*  Bhattacharya is a physician and economist at Stanford who co-authored a controversial [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=208.74s)]
*  manifesto in 2020 arguing against COVID lockdowns. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=213.3s)]
*  He said the virus should be allowed to spread among young, healthy people and that prevention [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=217.98s)]
*  efforts should be targeted to older people and the vulnerable. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=222.34s)]
*  He and his co-authors' ideas have been dismissed as fringe by the public health establishment, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=226.22s)]
*  though some gave the arguments a second look as the economic and mental health impacts [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=231.56s)]
*  caused by the lockdowns became clear. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=236.1s)]
*  Bhattacharya is the latest in a series of Trump health picks, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  who gained prominence during the pandemic by sharing views outside the mainstream and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=243.98s)]
*  are now poised to potentially upend the government's public health efforts. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  Today we're going to the park to have a little picnic, so I put some drinks in our cooler [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=252.22s)]
*  and packed the car for our adventure. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=262.42s)]
*  There have been a stream of videos across social media over the past few years. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=264.7s)]
*  And keeping the dogs hydrated is so important on days like this, so I packed plenty of water. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=268.9s)]
*  I always opt for PET plastics because they feature cheery influencers going about their [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=273.46s)]
*  days while casually talking up the benefits of certain plastic bottles. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=278.34s)]
*  Did you know that PET plastic bottles are a closed loop, zero waste system? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  Now the Times has obtained documents that show that those videos were part of a million [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=287.2s)]
*  dollar campaign by a trade group that represents some of the world's largest plastics and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=291.58s)]
*  petrochemical companies. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  The businesses behind the group, known as NAPCOR, make everything from Coke bottles [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=299.1s)]
*  to solo cups, and they've been trying to reverse what their internal files describe [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  as a quote, tide of anti-plastic sentiment. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=308.5s)]
*  There's been growing awareness in recent years that the vast majority of plastic doesn't [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=312.54s)]
*  ever get recycled, creating millions of tons of waste a year. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=316.24s)]
*  So we got these documents from a group called Fuel Notes, which is a watchdog group that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  focuses on the oil and gas sector. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=325.34s)]
*  And basically what interested me was just the very frank way in which this plastics [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  industry group was discussing, A, how to kind of win over hearts and minds, but also how [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=334.5s)]
*  they were saying, we need to get this messaging out in a way that kind of hides the fact that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=341.85999999999996s)]
*  this messaging was coming out of the plastics industry. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=346.41999999999996s)]
*  Hiroko Tabuchi covers the environment for the Times. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  She says NAPCOR hired half a dozen influencers to promote their products on TikTok, Instagram, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=352.18s)]
*  and Facebook. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  And while many of the ads did note that they were part of a campaign, the ad campaign's [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=358.58s)]
*  social media pages never mentioned NAPCOR. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=363.14s)]
*  The group also partnered with the actor Dennis Quaid to make a pro plastics episode of his [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=366.62s)]
*  TV show. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=371.42s)]
*  And they ran a social media campaign pushing back when the Paris Olympics banned single [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=372.94s)]
*  use plastics. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=377.34000000000003s)]
*  In the documents, we see the industry group really saying that they're pleased with how [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  these influencer campaigns turned out. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=382.38s)]
*  They say surveys show that people who saw the content had a much better view of the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=384.82s)]
*  plastics industry, for example. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=390.94s)]
*  And this is part of a wider battle that's being waged over the future of plastics. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=392.98s)]
*  There are global talks right now going on in South Korea where nations are trying to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=397.78000000000003s)]
*  hammer out a treaty that would tackle the plastic pollution problem once and for all. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=402.98s)]
*  And one of the options on the table is a measure that would restrict plastic production [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=408.16s)]
*  so that we are just using less plastic. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  That's something that the plastic industry would like to avoid. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=415.48s)]
*  They're arguing that plastics has a place in modern life as long as we are making sure [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=418.56s)]
*  it doesn't end up in the environment. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=422.76000000000005s)]
*  This week around Thanksgiving is always one of the busiest times to travel. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  And this year is shaping up to be record breaking. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=436.68s)]
*  More than 18 million Americans are expected to travel by air this week. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  And AAA says more than 70 million Americans will hit the road. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=444.06s)]
*  That would put the number of Thanksgiving travelers on track to beat out even pre-pandemic [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=447.92s)]
*  peaks. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=452.16s)]
*  Travel patterns are also changing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=453.72s)]
*  Since many people can now work remotely for a day or two, they're extending the holiday. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=456.16s)]
*  A lot of Americans already left Monday or Tuesday, and they may not come home until [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=460.52s)]
*  next week. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=464.6s)]
*  And some people are skipping the big family meal altogether. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=466.35999999999996s)]
*  There's been a surge in solo travel at this time of year. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  Travel experts say the stigma of spending the holidays alone has been fading, and the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=473.96s)]
*  appeal of a little self-care vacation has grown. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=478.32s)]
*  That's given people the green light to head to the beach or to Vegas instead of having [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=481.96s)]
*  to sleep back in their childhood bedroom or trying to make small talk with the uncle they [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=486.14s)]
*  haven't seen since last year. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=489.79999999999995s)]
*  And finally, phone scams have reached mind-boggling levels with tens of millions of scam calls [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=496.28s)]
*  a day. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=508.44s)]
*  The scammers dial people up looking for banking details, passwords, personal information, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=509.52s)]
*  which they have then used to steal billions of dollars. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=514.6s)]
*  Older adults in particular are seen as easy prey. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=518.72s)]
*  And now one British phone company, O2, has recruited a senior citizen of its own to fight [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=522.28s)]
*  back. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlLDu9m2oCM&t=528.0s)]
