# Inside Musk's Latest Political Donations, and Greenpeace Takes a Hit
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, March [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=0.0s)]
*  20th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=7.32s)]
*  As the clash between the Trump administration and the courts intensifies, Elon Musk has [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=13.86s)]
*  now stepped into the fray with his checkbook. Yesterday, Musk made the maximum allowable [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=19.22s)]
*  donation to seven Republican lawmakers who have all either called for judges who've [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=25.38s)]
*  ruled against the administration to be impeached or endorsed other actions in that vein. He [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=30.58s)]
*  gave each of them $6,600. The drumbeat to aggressively challenge the judiciary has been [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=35.86s)]
*  growing louder in recent days as the White House has been facing off with a federal judge [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=42.42s)]
*  over deportation flights. The judge has been pressing the government's lawyers about whether [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  the administration ignored his order to stop the flights. In response, Trump, Musk, and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=52.14s)]
*  some Republican lawmakers have been framing the judge as a liberal activist who needs [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=58.38s)]
*  to be thrown out. Musk now putting his money behind that effort shows how ready he is to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=62.82s)]
*  use his resources to back lawmakers who support the president's most radical moves. The attacks [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=68.9s)]
*  by Trump and his allies on the judiciary, which is supposed to have equal power to the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=75.78s)]
*  executive branch, have raised fears that the country's system of checks and balances is cracking. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=79.98s)]
*  The standoff between the Trump administration and the courts also appears to be raising the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=85.38000000000001s)]
*  threat of violence against judges. After Trump's calls to impeach the federal judge in the deportation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=92.9s)]
*  case, social media lit up with threats, taunts, and images of judges being handcuffed. And in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=98.42s)]
*  recent weeks, there have been a flurry of attempts to intimidate judges across the country, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  including bomb threats and swatting attacks, where heavily armed police storm people's homes [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=108.42s)]
*  after false 911 calls. The US Marshals Service even put out a bulletin warning of a new tactic [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=114.14s)]
*  seemingly designed to intimidate judges. People are sending Domino's Pizza deliveries to their [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=121.22s)]
*  houses as a way of showing that they know where they live. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=126.58s)]
*  Now, two updates on the education front. Later today, President Trump is expected to sign an [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=138.38s)]
*  executive order aimed at dismantling the Department of Education. The administration has already made [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=145.22s)]
*  deep cuts to it, but now Trump will instruct the Secretary of Education to shut down the agency [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=150.66s)]
*  altogether. It's not clear how that would happen. By law, only Congress has the authority to close [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  it, and no modern president has ever tried to unilaterally eliminate a department. Many of the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=162.1s)]
*  programs the department runs support low-income students and students with disabilities, and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=168.26s)]
*  multiple polls show closing the department is unpopular. About two-thirds of Americans oppose [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=173.82s)]
*  the idea. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is ramping up its targeting of universities. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  Yesterday, the White House said on social media that it's suspending $175 million in federal [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=188.42s)]
*  funding for the University of Pennsylvania because the school allowed a transgender woman to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=194.62s)]
*  compete on its women's swim team three years ago. The university said it hadn't received any [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=199.70000000000002s)]
*  official notification from the government, but the cuts would be the latest in the Trump [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=205.10000000000002s)]
*  administration's efforts to punish colleges for policies that don't align with the president's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=209.34s)]
*  agenda. It previously paused a large amount of funding for Columbia over how the university [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  handled what it said were anti-Semitic protests on campus. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=219.58s)]
*  Forecasting is always very, very hard. And in the current situation, I just think it's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=224.58s)]
*  uncertainty is remarkably high. At the Federal Reserve, Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=231.38000000000002s)]
*  President Trump's on-again, off-again, on-again tariffs could be taking a toll on the economy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=237.3s)]
*  Powell said the tariffs may be undermining their efforts to get inflation back down to the Fed's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  goal of 2%. You know, I think we were getting closer and closer to the goal of $1.5 billion [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=248.5s)]
*  to $1.5 billion. I wouldn't say we were at that. I do think with the arrival of the tariff [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=254.82s)]
*  inflation, further progress may be delayed. Against the backdrop of Trump's new trade [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=260.42s)]
*  policies, the Fed's now predicting higher inflation and slower growth for the U.S. economy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=265.86s)]
*  And Powell announced the Fed is holding interest rates steady for now. Investors seem to welcome [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=271.46s)]
*  that decision. Stocks ended the day higher than they started after several recent nosedives. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=277.14s)]
*  In North Dakota, a jury has ordered the environmental group Greenpeace to pay more than $660 million [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=284.5s)]
*  for its role in oil pipeline protests nearly a decade ago. The case centers on the Dakota [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=297.14s)]
*  Access Pipeline. In 2016, concerns about its potential environmental effects set off high [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=303.22s)]
*  profile protests on and around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Thousands of demonstrators set [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=309.62s)]
*  up camp there. At times, some protesters turned to vandalism or violence, and the pipeline company [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=315.62s)]
*  Energy Transfer sued Greenpeace over it, accusing the group of funding and supporting efforts that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=322.18s)]
*  delayed construction and harmed the company's reputation. Greenpeace denied that, but jurors [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=327.94s)]
*  sided against the group. It was a pretty full courtroom. There were a lot of Greenpeace staff [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=334.42s)]
*  members and supporters. There were a number of activists who had been involved in Standing Rock [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=339.14s)]
*  protests who had also come to watch the verdict. Karen's rake has been covering the trial for the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=345.06s)]
*  times. She says the verdict wasn't unexpected. The jury pool pulled from an area where a lot of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=350.18s)]
*  people have connections to the oil industry. The large financial penalty will primarily affect [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=356.02s)]
*  one specific arm of Greenpeace, Greenpeace Inc., which organizes public campaigns and protests. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=361.78s)]
*  The group has warned it could now go bankrupt. But Karen says the verdict is an alarm bell for [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=368.34s)]
*  activists in all kinds of fields because it feeds into a growing trend of tougher penalties for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=373.53999999999996s)]
*  protests. One of the people watching in the courtroom was Martin Garbus, who's a noted First [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=379.46s)]
*  Amendment lawyer. He's been working on these issues for many decades. I spoke to him afterwards, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=386.58s)]
*  and he told me that this was the worst First Amendment case decision he had ever seen. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  He said that it could really have a chilling effect on any protest group because the risks [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=398.34s)]
*  would just be too high, that any group involved in a protest could be blamed for anything that happened there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=403.61999999999995s)]
*  And finally, I'm Caroline Hopkins-Lagaspi. I'm a reporter on the Well Desk at The Times. And one of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=417.94s)]
*  the things we do is keep an eye out for nutrition trends that we see popping up all over the place. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  Then we'll turn to experts and ask, you know, whether there's any truth behind these health claims. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=428.34s)]
*  My favorite cooking fat is, drum roll please, tallow. Lately, I've been taking a closer look at beef tallow. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=432.9s)]
*  Beef tallow is rendered beef fat. It's basically just fat that's taken from the tissue that surrounds a cow's organs. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=440.9s)]
*  Just plain potatoes, salt, and beef tallow. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=447.7s)]
*  I'd started to see it advertised on bags of tortilla chips, potato chips. I also saw restaurants [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=452.73999999999995s)]
*  advertising their switch to frying in beef tallow. This steakhouse is called meat. I got my fingers [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=457.94s)]
*  crossed they don't use seed oils for the steak. Let's go find out. A big part of the reason people [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=463.3s)]
*  have been embracing beef tallow is that there's been growing criticism about the alternative, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=466.98s)]
*  which is seed oils. Seed oils include, you know, canola oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil. Seed oil is one of the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=472.9s)]
*  components of processed foods. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, he is [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=480.42s)]
*  claiming that they're poisoning Americans, that they're causing chronic disease. You taste these. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=486.9s)]
*  It's a completely different experience. Last week, R.F.K. Jr. went on Fox News, sat down at a steak [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=492.5s)]
*  and shake restaurant, and celebrated that steak and shake had begun to fry its french fries in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=498.9s)]
*  beef tallow instead of seed oil. We're very grateful for them for R.F.K. and the french fries. They turned me into a verb. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=505.14s)]
*  But I spoke to a number of cardiologists, dieticians, nutrition experts, and what I [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=511.7s)]
*  overwhelmingly heard across the board is that there's no health benefits of beef tallow. You're [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=517.46s)]
*  raising the amount of saturated fat you're eating, which in turn can cause high cholesterol and heart [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=522.58s)]
*  disease. And beef tallow is not something that people should be embracing as a health food. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=527.86s)]
*  But even more than that, what I heard from these experts I spoke with is that embracing beef tallow [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=532.74s)]
*  is kind of a misguided health trend. Ultimately, instead of arguing over the best cooking oil to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=537.7s)]
*  use when we fry our food, the healthier trend might be actually limiting fried food altogether. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=542.4200000000001s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, five years after the beginning of COVID, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=552.5s)]
*  a new book argues that there's no clear evidence pandemic lockdowns in the US [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=557.7s)]
*  saved lives. An interview with the book's authors. That's next in the New York Times [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=562.82s)]
*  audio app where you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjayWaEuY9A&t=567.86s)]
