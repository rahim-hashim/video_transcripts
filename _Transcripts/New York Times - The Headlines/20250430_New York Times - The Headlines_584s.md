# Trump Says He’s ‘Just Gotten Started,’ and Anti-Tourism Tactics in Europe
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=4.96s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, April 30th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=7.68s)]
*  We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=10.68s)]
*  100 days of any administration in the history of our country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=19.8s)]
*  And that's according to many, many people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=25.48s)]
*  President Trump took to the stage at a rally in Michigan last night to mark his first 100 [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=28.68s)]
*  days in office. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=33.24s)]
*  We've just gotten started. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=34.24s)]
*  You haven't even seen anything yet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=36.04s)]
*  It's all just kicking in. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=37.96s)]
*  In front of a crowd of 3,000, Trump seemed to return to campaign mode, falling back on [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=39.92s)]
*  his false claims the 2020 election was stolen and going off on tangents about President [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=44.92s)]
*  Biden. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=50.6s)]
*  Somebody convinced him that he looks great in a bathing suit. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=51.6s)]
*  He's 82 years old. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=54.4s)]
*  Terry Grant didn't look great in a bathing suit when he was 82. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=57.12s)]
*  The rally was intended to be a showcase of Trump's commitment to American manufacturing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=61.68s)]
*  He held it near Detroit, the center of the country's auto industry. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=66.84s)]
*  But Trump spent much of his speech talking about his border crackdown and deportation [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  numbers. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  We tried to get it higher, but the courts are giving us a hard time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  The president also dismissed poll numbers that show his approval rating has been dropping [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=79.6s)]
*  since he introduced aggressive new tariffs. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=84.72s)]
*  Trump's approval rating currently sits at 42 percent, according to the most recent Time [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  Sienna poll, historically low for a president this early in his term. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=92.28s)]
*  Also yesterday, in a concession that his tariffs have been weighing on the economy, the president [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=99.28s)]
*  moved to give American carmakers a bit of relief. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=107.0s)]
*  He's walking back some tariffs for the companies, though analysts say even with the tweaks, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=110.64s)]
*  the cost for car buyers is still expected to go up by thousands of dollars. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=116.08s)]
*  And Trump said the changes are only temporary. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=120.88s)]
*  He's still insisting that automakers move all of their production fully to the U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=123.62s)]
*  We give them a little time before we slaughter them if they don't do this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=129.26s)]
*  We're now seeing the early signs of Trump trying to figure out how to get himself out [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=134.36s)]
*  of the mess that he's put himself in through his trade war. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=138.82s)]
*  My colleague Jonathan Swan covers the Trump administration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=142.98s)]
*  Donald Trump testing out his theory of tariffs, his theory that he can use tariffs as this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  weapon against everyone at once and that everyone will bow down to him. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  That has run up against reality. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=157.26s)]
*  The trade situation is self-induced. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  He's basically started these wars, which he now will be looking for peace deals effectively. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=161.84s)]
*  And the economy right now is in a very, very wobbly place. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=167.5s)]
*  Some of the early indicators about business confidence and investment confidence, consumer [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=171.12s)]
*  confidence, these are all warning signs that the White House is looking at and that Trump [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=177.22s)]
*  himself is very aware of. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=182.36s)]
*  So I think for the next 100 days, everything is riding on the economy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=184.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, in an interview with ABC News that aired last night. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=197.62s)]
*  You could get him back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=201.58s)]
*  There's a phone on this desk. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=202.58s)]
*  I could. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=203.78s)]
*  You could pick it up and with all the power of the presidency, you could call up the president [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=204.78s)]
*  of El Salvador and say, send him back right now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=207.94s)]
*  And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=210.24s)]
*  But the court has ordered you to... [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=213.5s)]
*  President Trump said he could free Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the man his administration [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=215.34s)]
*  mistakenly deported to El Salvador, but he will not. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  The president's comments undermined previous statements from his administration in which [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=224.94s)]
*  they've claimed there's nothing they can do despite a Supreme Court order requiring [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=229.2s)]
*  them to take steps to bring him back to the U.S. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=233.9s)]
*  The judge overseeing the case has accused the administration of willful and bad faith [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=237.04s)]
*  stonewalling. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=241.78s)]
*  In Los Angeles. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=250.7s)]
*  We are tired of asking and it's time to demand what we want at the bargaining table. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  More than 50,000 county workers are in the middle of a two day strike that has ground [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=261.82s)]
*  some public services to a halt. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  Libraries across the county have closed, ambulances have been diverted from a hospital where workers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  walked out and wildfire debris cleanup has slowed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=274.48s)]
*  The union representing the workers called for the strike after contract negotiations [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=279.0s)]
*  with the county stalled. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=282.92s)]
*  The union is pushing for pay increases and it's accused government officials of retaliating [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=284.76s)]
*  against workers involved in union activity. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=289.76s)]
*  For its part, Los Angeles County says it's been trying to negotiate and has been warning [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=292.98s)]
*  that it's facing a growing budget crisis on multiple fronts that could throw the biggest [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=297.8s)]
*  county in the country into financial disarray. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=303.16s)]
*  It expects cleanup and recovery costs from this year's fires to approach $2 billion. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=306.58s)]
*  It's been hit hard by the Trump administration's cuts to federal funding. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=312.76s)]
*  And earlier this month, the county agreed to pay $4 billion to settle thousands of sex [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=316.85999999999996s)]
*  abuse claims dating back decades from kids in its juvenile detention and foster care [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=322.46s)]
*  systems. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  For millions of American high school students, tomorrow is decision day, the deadline for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=329.54s)]
*  them to confirm which college they'll enroll in this fall. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=338.84000000000003s)]
*  And the Times has been looking at the ongoing effects for schools and students of the Supreme [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  Court's landmark decision ending affirmative action. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=347.98s)]
*  Since the 2023 ruling, which barred colleges from considering students' race and admissions, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=351.86s)]
*  Black and Hispanic enrollment has dropped off nationwide and it's hit some schools particularly [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=357.8s)]
*  hard. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=363.44s)]
*  That includes Amherst College in Massachusetts, which had been a leader in racial diversity. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=364.44s)]
*  A lot of the Black and Hispanic students up there feel a bit of a sense of isolation now, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=369.68s)]
*  and there aren't as many Black and Hispanic students as they were expecting there to be [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=375.76s)]
*  in the freshman class. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=382.64s)]
*  New York Times education reporter Stephanie Saul recently went to Amherst, where Black [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=385.04s)]
*  enrollment plunged from 11% overall before the Supreme Court's ruling to just 3% of this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=388.88s)]
*  year's class. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=395.0s)]
*  There was one student from Washington Heights, New York who identifies as Afro-Latina, and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=396.36s)]
*  she said that only one other Black student was in her chemistry class. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=403.88s)]
*  She had been the only Black student in what's known as the freshman seminar. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=409.14s)]
*  And some students said that at activities, Black Student Union meetings, etc., that the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=415.04s)]
*  turnout has been affected and they feel a little sense of disappointment and worry that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=421.96000000000004s)]
*  maybe this will cause a vicious cycle, that the next group of students who are being recruited [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=430.22s)]
*  will pick up on this and fewer Black and Hispanic students will want to come next year. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=437.26s)]
*  So they're kind of in a waiting game to see the outcome. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=444.48s)]
*  Stephanie says that Amherst and other schools have been trying to figure out ways to keep [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=449.8s)]
*  diversifying their classes, even if they can't consider students' race anymore. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=454.0s)]
*  That includes expanding financial aid and boosting efforts to bring in first-generation [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=459.12s)]
*  college students. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=463.76s)]
*  This year, Amherst says that about a quarter of students they've offered admission to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=465.6s)]
*  would be the first in their family to attend college, a record for the school. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=470.0s)]
*  And finally, travelers may love a European summer vacation, eating tapas in Barcelona, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=479.04s)]
*  island hopping in Greece, or taking a gondola ride in Venice, but many Europeans are over [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=485.16s)]
*  it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=491.16s)]
*  The number of tourists from the U.S. and elsewhere has broken records, overwhelming some cities [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=492.16s)]
*  to the point that they've been putting in measures to keep people away. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=497.74s)]
*  For example, Venice started charging an admission fee, Dubrovnik and Croatia cut back the number [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=501.34000000000003s)]
*  of taxis and outdoor dining spaces, and cities like Amsterdam have banned the construction [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=506.86s)]
*  of new hotels. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=512.82s)]
*  Now, anti-tourism activists are planning to confront tourists directly, to bring attention [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=514.3000000000001s)]
*  to housing shortages, overcrowding, and other issues that they say the tourism boom has [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=520.4200000000001s)]
*  fueled. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=524.74s)]
*  The activists met this past weekend to workshop strategies that include blockading tour buses, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=525.98s)]
*  picketing outside airports, and obstructing historic sites. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  But the main symbol of their resistance is the humble water gun. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=536.1800000000001s)]
*  Last summer, anti-tourism protesters used the water guns to squirt tourists along one [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=543.7s)]
*  of Barcelona's most famous streets, chanting, go home. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF_0PBREoK8&t=548.86s)]
