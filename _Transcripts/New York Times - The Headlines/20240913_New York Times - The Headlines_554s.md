# U.S. May Approve Ukrainian Strikes Deep in Russia, and Early Voting Begins
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Friday, September 13th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=6.44s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=8.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris's campaign announced that it's seen a huge post-debate jump in donations, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=14.56s)]
*  bringing in almost $50 million in the 24 hours after her debate with Donald Trump. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=19.72s)]
*  And she's eager to debate again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=25.38s)]
*  At a rally in North Carolina yesterday, she told her supporters that she and Trump, quote, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=27.84s)]
*  owe it to the voters to debate a second time. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=32.6s)]
*  But Trump disagrees. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=35.2s)]
*  When a prize fighter loses a fight, you've seen a lot of fights, right? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=37.28s)]
*  The first words out of that fighter's mouth is, I want to rematch. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=41.74s)]
*  I want to rematch. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=46.44s)]
*  And that's what she said. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=47.92s)]
*  I want to rematch. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=48.92s)]
*  At a rally of his own in Arizona, Trump said his debates this year, first with Biden, then [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=50.2s)]
*  with Harris, were so successful, there doesn't need to be another one. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=54.96s)]
*  It's too late anyway. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=58.32s)]
*  The voting's already begun. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=59.4s)]
*  You got to go out and vote. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=60.72s)]
*  We got to vote. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=62.8s)]
*  Meanwhile, early voting is getting underway. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=63.8s)]
*  Mail-in ballots are now being sent out in some states, the first of the election. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=67.48s)]
*  Alabama and North Carolina started this week. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=72.28s)]
*  The swing states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania will start in the next few days. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=74.68s)]
*  Nationwide, Americans have been increasingly turning to mail-in voting instead of going [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=79.0s)]
*  to vote in person. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=83.3s)]
*  More than 60 million people mailed in ballots in the last presidential election. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=84.88s)]
*  But there's been a noticeable split by party. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=89.3s)]
*  A lot of this dates back to the 2020 election, when former President Trump was casting lots [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=92.0s)]
*  of aspersions on vote by mail, saying you need to vote in person, while Democrats were [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=98.56s)]
*  much more aligned with a lot of COVID policies and therefore were also embracing vote by [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=103.44s)]
*  mail in record numbers. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=108.6s)]
*  Nick Kourosanidi covers voting for the Times. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=111.32s)]
*  He says in 2020, Democrats were almost twice as likely to vote by mail than Republicans. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=113.44s)]
*  This election, the GOP is trying to narrow that gap. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=119.32s)]
*  In the 2024 election, we've seen Republicans at both the national and state level start [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=123.16s)]
*  to make a concerted effort to convince their voters that vote by mail is safe and a method [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  that they should embrace. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=133.88s)]
*  Groups like Turning Point have run a multi-state chase the vote program. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=135.72s)]
*  The Trump campaign has started their own program known as Swamp the Vote, trying to get voters [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=140.04s)]
*  to embrace voting by mail and bank their vote early. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=144.64s)]
*  But Republican voters might be hearing a bit of a mixed message from Mr. Trump himself. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=148.42s)]
*  While he's been out there in videos and on the campaign trail saying, you know, we need [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=153.92s)]
*  to vote by mail, he's also regularly very critical of it, saying we need to go back [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=157.14s)]
*  to one-day voting and paper ballots and calling mail voting rigged at times. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=161.88s)]
*  So it's sending a bit of a conflicting message of embrace this, but we also need to get rid [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=167.04s)]
*  of it that, you know, might have some Republican voters still hesitant to cast their mail ballot. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=172.1s)]
*  The Times has learned that President Biden is on the verge of clearing the way for Ukraine [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  to use long-range Western weapons to attack Russia. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=189.16s)]
*  The weapons wouldn't be American-made. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=193.68s)]
*  They're missiles from Britain and France. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=195.6s)]
*  But the go-ahead would be crossing what has been a red line for Biden. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Britain's already signaled that it's eager to give Ukraine the green light, and it wants [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  explicit permission from the U.S. to show that Ukraine's allies have a coordinated strategy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=206.44s)]
*  Ukraine has been increasingly insistent that it needs to use the weapons to hit Russia [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  far behind the front lines to take out Russian airfields, weapons depots, and other targets. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=216.28s)]
*  The long-range missiles would also let Ukraine continue to pressure Vladimir Putin by taking [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=222.72s)]
*  the fight into Russia. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=227.6s)]
*  In recent weeks, Ukraine's been holding Russian territory and attacking Russian cities with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=229.78s)]
*  hundreds of drones. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=233.92s)]
*  The question of whether Biden will say yes to Ukraine's requests has played out repeatedly [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=236.04s)]
*  during the war, as he's tried to balance supporting Ukraine with not provoking a major [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=240.28s)]
*  escalation from Putin. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=245.24s)]
*  On Thursday, Putin issued an unusually specific warning to the West about allowing Ukraine [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=247.36s)]
*  to use the long-range weapons. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=252.68s)]
*  He said that because they require Western technical help and satellite guidance, it [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=254.94000000000003s)]
*  would change the, quote, essence of the conflict, and that NATO countries, including the U.S., [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=259.32s)]
*  would be at war with Russia. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  White House officials say that Biden hasn't made up his mind yet, but that he'll discuss [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=269.6s)]
*  the issue with Britain's new Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, who's making his first official [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=273.44s)]
*  visit to Washington today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  At midnight in Seattle, thousands of union workers at Boeing walked off the job after [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=288.44s)]
*  they rejected a contract offer and voted to authorize a strike. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=293.55999999999995s)]
*  The walkout is expected to shut down most of the company's commercial plane manufacturing, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=298.08s)]
*  resulting production of the Boeing 737 MAX. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=303.04s)]
*  The union has been at odds with the company over pay and retirement benefits. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=306.48s)]
*  Union leaders say the proposed contract was the best they'd ever negotiated, but 96 percent [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=311.22s)]
*  of union members still voted to strike, potentially sensing that they have the upper hand as Boeing's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=316.72s)]
*  been struggling. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  The company's been veering from one crisis to another, and federal regulators already [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=324.0s)]
*  of the 737 MAX earlier this year after a door panel blew out mid-flight, exposing safety [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=329.32s)]
*  and quality issues at the company. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=335.12s)]
*  The strike could be a huge financial blow to Boeing, which plays a substantial role [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=337.88s)]
*  in the U.S. economy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=342.44s)]
*  The last strike by its workers in 2008 went on for almost two months. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=344.32s)]
*  If this walkout goes on that long, one estimate says it could cost the company more than $3 [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=348.68s)]
*  billion. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=354.0s)]
*  This spring on many college campuses, the sound of protest was nearly constant. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=360.67999999999995s)]
*  Students angered by the war in Gaza set up tent encampments, and thousands of demonstrators [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  were arrested across the country. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=372.91999999999996s)]
*  Now as the fall semester gets underway, many schools have rolled out new restrictions on [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=376.4s)]
*  campus protests. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  Emory, Rutgers, and the University of California system have banned encampments on their campuses. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=382.56s)]
*  Students at other schools like Case Western and Carnegie Mellon now have to get permission [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=388.8s)]
*  for large-scale protests. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  And some schools have basically put in place curfews or even time limits for demonstrations. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=395.2s)]
*  One college in Pennsylvania says protests and rallies can now only last two hours. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=400.96s)]
*  At Ohio State, all campus events must now end by 10 p.m. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=406.96s)]
*  Attorneys the Times spoke with say the restrictions don't seem to violate constitutional protections [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=411.92s)]
*  for free speech, though the ACLU of Indiana has already brought a lawsuit against a university [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=417.28s)]
*  there over its new policies. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=422.6s)]
*  And finally, this season of theater on and off-Broadway is going to be so packed with [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=429.56s)]
*  celebrities you're going to be tripping over them in the aisles. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=434.12s)]
*  It's not new for big Hollywood names to take a turn on stage, but this slate is unusually star-studded. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=437.6s)]

*  slump in the pandemic, from which they have not recovered. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=477.40000000000003s)]
*  For the actors, it's a different calculation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  TV networks and streaming companies have been slashing the number of new series, and Hollywood's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5aNNl5dEj4&t=484.16s)]
