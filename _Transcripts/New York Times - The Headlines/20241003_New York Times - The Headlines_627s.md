# Biden Deploys Troops in Helene Aid Effort, and Trump’s Jan. 6 Case
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=5.2s)]
*  Today's Thursday, October 3rd. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=8.6s)]
*  You can see homes that have moved from clearly from one side of the river down the river [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=13.96s)]
*  to another side of the river. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=18.44s)]
*  And I can only imagine what it's like to have been in one of those homes. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=20.52s)]
*  President Biden flew over Asheville and the mountains of North Carolina yesterday to survey [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=24.92s)]
*  the damage from Hurricane Helene, which turned creeks into rivers and flattened whole towns. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=29.68s)]
*  Massive trees uprooted. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=36.8s)]
*  Homes literally swept off their foundations, swept down rivers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=38.8s)]
*  You know, families are heartbroken. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=42.76s)]
*  The death toll from the storm has now risen to at least 180 people across six states. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=45.04s)]
*  Biden ordered the Pentagon to send 1,000 active duty troops to help in North Carolina, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=51.32s)]
*  where rescue workers are still trying to reach remote communities, where people have been cut off by floodwaters, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=57.08s)]
*  downed trees and washed out highways. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=62.92s)]
*  Biden also called on lawmakers to ensure the Federal Emergency Management Agency gets more resources. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=66.36s)]
*  The Homeland Security Secretary, who oversees FEMA, has warned that the agency doesn't [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=73.48s)]
*  have enough funding to make it through the rest of this hurricane season. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=78.4s)]
*  The sheer amount of rain that poured down in North Carolina was so intense that no amount [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=84.12s)]
*  of preparation could have entirely prevented the destruction there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=89.2s)]
*  But the Times has been looking at how decisions by state officials likely made some of that damage worse. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  Over the last 15 years, Republican lawmakers in North Carolina repeatedly blocked rules [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=100.2s)]
*  that experts say could have prevented some of the storm damage, like limiting construction [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=105.92s)]
*  on steep slopes or requiring homes to be built above expected flood levels. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=110.92s)]
*  The argument in favor of easing regulations or not adding new regulations has a certain logic to it, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=116.8s)]
*  Proponents make the point that every new requirement or regulation on homebuilders [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=124.28s)]
*  tends to increase the upfront cost of a home. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=131.12s)]
*  And so their sort of argument, their explanation for this is they want to keep homes as affordable [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=134.44s)]
*  as possible. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=140.64s)]
*  Christopher Flavell reports on the effects of climate change for the Times. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=142.0s)]
*  The counter argument, the point that was made to me by engineers and safety officials and Democrats was, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=146.11999999999998s)]
*  sure, but over the lifetime of a home, if it's more vulnerable to storms or to flooding, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  the cost will only increase, as well as the danger people face as these events become more frequent and severe. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=159.48s)]
*  Christopher says North Carolina now faces a major question as the state recovers. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=167.23999999999998s)]
*  Should it rebuild to a higher standard, implementing some of the preparedness measures that Republicans have resisted? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=172.32s)]
*  That would mean higher upfront costs now, but it would mean people are better protected down the road. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=179.32s)]
*  So this question of building codes kind of feels wonky and nerdy, but actually is hugely consequential [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=184.35999999999999s)]
*  as the state tries to recover from this storm. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=192.48s)]
*  On Wednesday, we got the fullest picture yet of the evidence that the special counsel Jack Smith has collected [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=197.2s)]
*  about Donald Trump and his efforts to stay in power. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=214.16s)]
*  Times reporter Alan Foyer has been covering the twists and turns in the federal election case against Donald Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  In the latest development, the judge in the case just unsealed a document from the prosecution [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=223.84s)]
*  that outlines their argument for why Trump should not be immune from charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=229.24s)]
*  Jack Smith essentially presented all of the facts that he has collected over the last two years of investigating Donald Trump. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=237.08s)]
*  Some of the highlights were the following. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  When Trump was told by one of his advisors that his own vice president, Mike Pence, was in danger during the riot at the Capitol on January 6, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=249.56s)]
*  Donald Trump said, so what? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=261.48s)]
*  When one of Trump's lawyers told him that his false claims that the election had been marred by fraud were probably not going to hold up in court, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump's response? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=272.96s)]
*  The details don't matter. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=274.36s)]
*  And on a flight that Trump and his family were taking after the election, an Oval Office assistant overheard Trump saying, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=276.52s)]
*  it doesn't matter if you won or lost the election, you still have to fight like hell. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=285.32s)]
*  Alan says the prosecution is aiming to show that Trump's actions surrounding the election were the actions of a losing candidate, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=291.44s)]
*  not the official acts of a president, which the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year are covered by immunity. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=299.32s)]
*  Trump's legal team is expected to submit their own arguments to the judge in the next two weeks. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=305.88s)]
*  Last night, the former president railed against Smith's filing in a TV interview, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=311.12s)]
*  repeating without evidence that it's part of a government conspiracy against him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=316.6s)]
*  This was a weaponization of government, and that's why it was released 30 days before the election. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=321.2s)]
*  And it's nothing new in there, by the way, nothing new. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=326.64s)]
*  They rigged the election. I didn't rig the election. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=329.4s)]
*  They rigged the election. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=331.92s)]
*  Any decision the judge makes on whether the case against Trump can move forward is likely to be appealed back up to the Supreme Court. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=333.68s)]
*  The Times has learned that Israel is still weighing how it will retaliate against Iran for the latest missile strike, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=346.72s)]
*  but that whatever action it takes will likely be far more forceful than how it's responded before. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=353.72s)]
*  There's a growing sense that Israel is willing to risk a violent counterattack, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=360.32s)]
*  with one former senior security official saying, quote, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  Many in Israel see this as an opportunity to do more to inflict pain on Iran. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=368.35999999999996s)]
*  Israeli officials tell the Times that they might target Iranian oil production sites or military bases, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=374.76s)]
*  but that the exact nature of the plan might not become clear until after the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, which runs until tomorrow night. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=381.55999999999995s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Israeli offensives in Lebanon and Gaza have continued. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=389.68s)]
*  Loud explosions were heard in Beirut overnight as Israel said it conducted a strike there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=394.48s)]
*  In the south of Lebanon, where Israel invaded, the Israeli military clashed at close range with Hezbollah fighters. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  The United Nations says that more than a million people in Lebanon have now been displaced by the fighting. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=406.6s)]
*  And in Gaza, dozens of people have been killed in Israeli attacks in the last two days. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=412.8s)]
*  At least 50 were killed in Hanunis during strikes on several homes and schools being used as shelters. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=418.36s)]
*  The Israeli military said they were Hamas command centers, though it didn't provide evidence. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  And in northern Gaza, at least eight people were killed when Israel bombed an orphanage building. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=430.24s)]
*  The owner of the building says hundreds of civilians were staying there, mostly women and children. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=436.0s)]
*  Russia's President Vladimir Putin is doubling down on efforts to pull more everyday Russians into what he sees as a broad fight against the West. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=440.92s)]
*  For men, he wants them to enlist. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=457.8s)]
*  The Russian military has an urgent need for troops. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  According to some estimates, about 1,000 soldiers a day are being killed or injured in its war in Ukraine. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=463.6s)]
*  The government has now doubled signing bonuses and is allowing criminal suspects to avoid a trial if they enlist. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  For women, Putin wants them to have more children, not just for future military recruits, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=478.2s)]
*  but also to keep Russia's workforce up as the country's economy becomes increasingly isolated from the West. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=484.76s)]
*  Russian women can now get nearly $7,000 for having their first child. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=492.24s)]
*  And lawmakers have proposed a new ban on advocating a child-free lifestyle. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=497.68s)]
*  Anyone who breaks the law could face up to $50,000 in fines. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=503.64s)]
*  The number of children born in Russia in the first half of this year was the lowest in a quarter century. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  That's in part because there are far fewer women of childbearing age due to the poverty and chaos one generation ago when the Soviet Union collapsed. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=514.28s)]
*  And finally, it is fully fall, whether you are ready to admit that or not, and the leaves are turning. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=528.16s)]
*  That means it's leaf-peeping season, when millions of people fan out to catch the changing reds, yellows, and golds of the forest. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=534.96s)]
*  But for people who are red-green colorblind, that stunning fall landscape often looks kind of muted, not a lot of difference between the shades. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=543.08s)]
*  Now, the Virginia State Park System is trying to change that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=553.24s)]
*  This year, it says it was the first park system in the country to install new viewfinders at all of its locations that give colorblind visitors the full effect. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=556.24s)]
*  The viewfinders use special lenses to expand the range of visible colors. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=565.8399999999999s)]
*  The initiative is led by a Virginia park ranger who's colorblind himself. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=570.8399999999999s)]
*  He told the Times the response has been overwhelming. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  One visitor told him it was, quote, like a highlighter had been taken to the world. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=578.84s)]
*  About 13 million people in the U.S. are colorblind to some degree. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=583.64s)]
*  Problems distinguishing between shades with red and green in them is the most common. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=587.64s)]
*  You can see an example of how fall leaves look with and without that colorblind view at NYTimes.com. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=592.64s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=603.64s)]
*  Today on The Daily, the Times reporters covering Iran and Israel explain how each country is weighing what to do next. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  Listen in the New York Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiSgQ81jS8o&t=614.4399999999999s)]
