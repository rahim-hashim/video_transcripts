# Protests Over Immigration Raids, Austria Reels From School Shooting, a BTS Reunion | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, June 11th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=8.28s)]
*  The protests over President Trump's immigration crackdown have expanded. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=20.12s)]
*  Demonstrators in at least two dozen cities across the country are pushing back against [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=24.96s)]
*  raids from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=28.96s)]
*  From New York to Chicago to Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=37.08s)]
*  And in Los Angeles, after days of protests, local officials declared a curfew for downtown. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=48.24s)]
*  If you do not live or work in downtown L.A., avoid the area. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=53.56s)]
*  Law enforcement will arrest individuals who break the curfew and you will be prosecuted. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=58.8s)]
*  The protests around the country have been largely peaceful and contained to small sections [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=64.48s)]
*  of cities. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=68.8s)]
*  But since Friday, at least 350 demonstrators have been arrested across five cities. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=69.94s)]
*  Many were charged with failing to disperse, though some have been accused of looting, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=75.56s)]
*  harassment and throwing Molotov cocktails. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=79.44s)]
*  These are insurrectionists, they're agitators or troublemakers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  At a minimum, they're troublemakers. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=86.36s)]
*  Trump has promised a harsh response to the demonstrations and deployed almost 5,000 federal [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=88.8s)]
*  troops to Los Angeles. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=93.64s)]
*  California sued the administration over those deployments, arguing that they're illegal. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=95.52s)]
*  And officials there, including Governor Gavin Newsom, say the president has only inflamed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=100.28s)]
*  tensions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=104.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's government isn't protecting our communities, they're traumatizing our [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=105.6s)]
*  communities. And that seems to be the entire point. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=109.76s)]
*  And as protests escalate around the country, one U.S. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  official told the Times the administration is considering deploying troops to other cities. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=116.64s)]
*  That could force more clashes with Democratic governors. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=121.6s)]
*  But at least one state leader is on board. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=124.68s)]
*  In Texas, Republican Governor Greg Abbott announced he would deploy National Guard troops [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=127.44s)]
*  to quell protests himself. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=131.92s)]
*  Just over a dozen demonstrators in Texas have been arrested in the protests. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=134.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, the ICE raids at the heart of the protests have continued this week. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=139.88s)]
*  And last night, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that in Los Angeles, members [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=144.2s)]
*  of the National Guard are assisting ICE in those efforts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=148.8s)]
*  ICE posted images on social media of its officers detaining people as armed National Guard troops [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=152.48s)]
*  stood by. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=157.92s)]
*  Today, 700 Marines are expected to join the National Guard in protecting ICE agents and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=159.2s)]
*  federal buildings in Los Angeles. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=164.56s)]
*  The Times has been looking into a growing number of Washington lawmakers who've held [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=170.68s)]
*  onto their seats despite showing signs of physical and cognitive decline. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=175.16s)]
*  This current Congress has the most members above the age of 70 in modern history. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=179.88s)]
*  When this session of Congress was convened in January, there were nearly 120 members [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  who were 70 or older. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=189.52s)]
*  Three of them, all House Democrats, have died this year. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=191.16s)]
*  And the House's oldest member, Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, D.C., turns 88 [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=194.56s)]
*  this week. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=199.68s)]
*  The civil rights leader said on Tuesday that she would run for re-election, only to slightly [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=200.8s)]
*  walk back the comment hours later. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=205.08s)]
*  Questions about her political future come as sources tell the Times that in recent years, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=208.16s)]
*  Norton has become frail and has struggled to do her job. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  I even have some lawmakers on the record being willing to say with all respect to her legacy [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=215.8s)]
*  and her achievements, it's time for a new generation at this critical moment to take [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=222.72s)]
*  over. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=227.68s)]
*  My colleague Annie Carney covers Congress. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=228.88s)]
*  What I heard was just across the board, concerned about her ability to do the job at this point. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  She sometimes doesn't recognize people she's known for years. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=235.88s)]
*  She needs staff to remind her where she is sometimes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=239.2s)]
*  And someone I spoke to who recently met with her described themselves as shell shocked [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=242.12s)]
*  at how much her staff had to fill in the blanks for her. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=246.64s)]
*  This is not an original story at all on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we've seen just in the past few years, the exact playbook play out with Senator Dianne [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=254.72000000000003s)]
*  Feinstein, a lion in her prime, like a really forceful lawmaker who refused to let go of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=260.56s)]
*  her seat, even when it was clear she could not function in that job. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  And she eventually died in office in 2023 at the age of 90. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=272.68s)]
*  So it is a problem with aging lawmakers who cannot see their own condition and who do [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=277.76s)]
*  not want to leave. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=284.36s)]
*  The Southern Baptist Convention, one of the country's most powerful evangelical organizations, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=290.76s)]
*  has officially declared one of its next political targets, same-sex marriage. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=295.88s)]
*  The denomination has long opposed gay marriage, but on Tuesday, its members voted for the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=301.4s)]
*  first time as an official body to work towards legally ending it in the U.S. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=306.04s)]
*  The decision was heavily influenced by the decades-long campaign against abortion. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  Conservative Christians spent years on lobbying, messaging, and advocating for anti-abortion [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=316.92s)]
*  judges. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=321.44s)]
*  And after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago, Southern Baptist [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=322.56s)]
*  strategists saw a potential blueprint for gay marriage. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=326.56s)]
*  Many Southern Baptists acknowledged that gay marriage has widespread support across the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  country and that for many Americans, the issue is effectively settled. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=334.32s)]
*  But the vote shows that evangelicals have long-term ambitions and are willing to put [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=338.64s)]
*  in the time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=342.68s)]
*  As Denny Burke, the president of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, put it, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=343.92s)]
*  quote, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=348.48s)]
*  We know that we're in a minority in the culture right now, but we want to be a prophetic [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=349.48s)]
*  minority. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=353.2s)]
*  Austria suffered one of its deadliest attacks in modern history on Tuesday, when a gunman [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=354.2s)]
*  opened fire in a high school in the city of Graz, killing 10 people. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  The gunman was then found dead in a school bathroom in what authorities are calling an [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  apparent suicide. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=375.36s)]
*  So far, Austrian police aren't releasing much information about either the victims or the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  shooter. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=381.88s)]
*  But it's been said that the gunman was a 21-year-old former student at the school who [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=382.88s)]
*  they say never graduated. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=386.32s)]
*  He had two guns with him during the shooting, both of which were obtained legally. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=388.12s)]
*  It's one of Europe's worst school shootings in years. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=392.28s)]
*  Mass shootings of any kind are rare in Europe, likely due to the low prevalence of guns. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=395.92s)]
*  Though Austria is one of the most heavily armed countries in the world, its civilian [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=401.2s)]
*  firearm rate is just a quarter of that of the United States, where shootings like these [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=405.28s)]
*  are far more common. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=409.96s)]
*  And finally, K-pop fans rejoice because two of its biggest stars, singers RM and V, both [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=412.88s)]
*  members of the wildly popular boy band BTS, have been discharged from South Korea's mandatory [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=432.44s)]
*  military service. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=438.04s)]
*  This means the band's three-year-long hiatus is one step closer to ending. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=439.72s)]
*  The two singers emerged from a military base to cheering fans, despite their record label [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=447.16s)]
*  pleading with people to stay home and not make a spectacle out of it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=451.66s)]
*  V carried a bouquet of flowers, while RM came out with a saxophone that he used to give [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  an impromptu performance. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=459.78000000000003s)]
*  Four of BTS' seven members have now concluded their national service. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=467.52s)]
*  Two more, Jimin and Jungkook, will be discharged later today. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  The final member, Suga, is scheduled to end his service at the end of next week. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=475.76s)]
*  After their time in service, members of the band will soon head back to the studio to [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=480.96s)]
*  make music once again for the other ARMY, their rabid online fan base. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=497.52s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look inside an ICE operation as the Trump administration tries to boost [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=505.35999999999996s)]
*  its deportation numbers. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=510.52s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_AOrqFHYbA&t=512.3199999999999s)]
