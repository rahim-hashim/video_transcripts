# Texas Floods, a Misleading Social Security Email, What Your TV Knows About You | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, July 7th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=7.72s)]
*  The scene was just out of a war zone. The river was swollen. They had taken entire neighborhoods. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=13.64s)]
*  Entire houses were gone. There were smashed trees everywhere. And it was difficult to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=20.88s)]
*  navigate. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=26.16s)]
*  My colleague Edgar Sandoval has been in Kerr County, Texas all weekend, where torrential [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=27.44s)]
*  rains on the 4th of July triggered one of the deadliest floods in the U.S. in the past [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=31.76s)]
*  century. The Guadalupe River, lined in part with RV parks and summer camps, burst its [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=36.04s)]
*  banks Friday, rising as much as 20 feet in two hours, while many were still sleeping. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=41.92s)]
*  As of this morning, at least 81 people are dead and at least 40 remain missing. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=47.92s)]
*  Rains are pretty common here. The residents tell me that this is the first time they've [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  seen the water reach the houses. And this is just something that no one has experienced [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=56.68s)]
*  before and they weren't ready for. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=62.0s)]
*  By Sunday, people from around the region had poured into the county northwest of San Antonio, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=64.72s)]
*  trying to find their loved ones. Edgar spoke with a woman who was waiting to hear about [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=69.64s)]
*  five of her family members who were swept away from their campsite. One of the group, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=73.62s)]
*  her cousin, was found alive, desperately clinging to a tree after being carried more than 15 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=78.36s)]
*  miles in the floodwaters. But the rest are still missing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=83.28s)]
*  Camp Mystic looking for our kids and then we're looking for places that they're going [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=86.4s)]
*  to potentially be alive. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  Among the hardest hit places was Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian camp where several [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=93.76s)]
*  kids were killed and where at least 10 campers are still unaccounted for. One camper told [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Fox News about what it was like to watch the water rise higher and higher. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=104.2s)]
*  I put on my name tag because I was scared that our cabin might be next. In my head I [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=108.72s)]
*  If something does happen and I do get swept away, at least I'll have my name on my body. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  It's been a tough three days for Texans and I can assure you here at this table today [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  that everything that can be done is being done. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, officials say search and rescue efforts are ongoing even as the window for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=131.8s)]
*  finding survivors is closing. They say they're also reviewing the county's emergency notification [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  system amid growing criticism. Authorities urged people to seek higher ground at about [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=141.68s)]
*  4 a.m. Friday, but at that point many people say they were already trapped. The county [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=147.4s)]
*  considered installing a flood warning system back in 2017. It was rejected at the time [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=152.84s)]
*  as too expensive. There have also been questions about whether the National Weather Service [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=158.18s)]
*  was sufficiently staffed ahead of the storms. Some of the central Texas offices had job [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=162.98s)]
*  vacancies for crucial positions with twice as many openings in the offices as there [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=168.52s)]
*  were in January when President Trump started cutting the federal workforce. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=173.44s)]
*  In Washington this holiday weekend, Republicans gathered at the White House for a Fourth of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  July celebration centered on watching President Trump sign his sweeping domestic policy bill [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=189.36s)]
*  into law. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=194.88s)]
*  This is the gavel we use to enact the big beautiful bill and I want you to have that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=195.88s)]
*  Even before Trump officially signed the bill, the Social Security Administration sent out [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=201.14s)]
*  a celebratory email to people across the country highlighting some of the tax cuts in the legislation. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  But the Times found that the email was misleading. It claimed that the new law eliminates federal [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=211.7s)]
*  income tax on most retirees' benefits. In fact, it does not include a specific tax cut [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=217.38s)]
*  on Social Security payments, only on overall income. And the savings for people receiving [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  Social Security will be limited since more than half of them have income that's already [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=228.8s)]
*  too low to be taxed anyway. The email also claimed that the legislation will protect [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=232.86s)]
*  Social Security, though experts say the tax cuts will actually weaken the program's finances, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=237.68s)]
*  which could lead to millions of Americans facing reductions to their benefits by the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=243.66s)]
*  year 2033. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=247.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Times has been looking into other provisions of the new law and when Americans [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=250.72s)]
*  will begin to feel the effects. The Republicans seem to have made a key political calculation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=255.52s)]
*  on the timing. They front-loaded popular moves like new generous tax cuts that people could [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=261.16s)]
*  see as soon as next year. At the same time, they put off some of the most unpopular provisions [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=266.76s)]
*  like steep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. Those cuts won't kick in until after the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=272.88s)]
*  2026 midterm elections. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=278.2s)]
*  Now, three other updates on the Trump administration. The group of migrants that U.S. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=287.28s)]
*  officials have been trying to deport to South Sudan was finally flown there late Friday [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=292.26s)]
*  after weeks of legal limbo. Most of the eight men have no connection to the country, and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=297.12s)]
*  their lawyers had tried to stop the deportations, arguing that they hadn't received adequate [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=302.64s)]
*  due process and were at risk of being tortured there. As their case worked its way through [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=307.2s)]
*  the courts, the men had been held in a converted shipping container at a U.S. army base in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=312.36s)]
*  nearby Djibouti. The Supreme Court ultimately gave the administration the green light to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=316.94s)]
*  move forward with the deportations. It's not clear if the men were taken into custody [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=321.38s)]
*  by South Sudanese authorities once they landed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=325.74s)]
*  Also, let's talk about tariffs. What happens on Wednesday? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  We'll see. I'm not going to give away the playbook because we're going to be very busy [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=333.64s)]
*  over the next 72 hours. Treasury Secretary Scott Besson said he's confident the U.S. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=339.52s)]
*  will be able to reach agreements with more of its trading partners before President Trump's [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=344.76s)]
*  aggressive tariffs are scheduled to kick back in. The tariffs have been abruptly paused [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=349.74s)]
*  for 90 days after Trump's plans set off a global financial panic. Since then, the administration [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=354.52s)]
*  has only reached two preliminary trade deals with Vietnam and the U.K., far short of the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=360.92s)]
*  90 deals it promised it would make during the pause. It's not clear how seriously the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=366.48s)]
*  administration will take its own Wednesday deadline. Besson and Trump have recently said [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=371.44s)]
*  the tariffs may not actually kick back in until August 1st. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  And today at the White House, President Trump will welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=381.24s)]
*  Netanyahu for his third visit since Trump returned to office. Leading up to the meeting, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  President Trump has doubled down on his calls for Israel to reach a ceasefire agreement [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=390.52s)]
*  with Hamas, writing on social media, quote, Make the deal in Gaza. Get the hostages back. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=395.24s)]
*  Negotiators from both sides are currently considering a proposal that would pause fighting [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=401.4s)]
*  in Gaza for 60 days. But hardliners in Netanyahu's government have opposed an end to the war [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=405.68s)]
*  and want Israel to remain in control of the territory. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=412.08s)]
*  And finally, it is not a conspiracy theory. If you've ever wondered if your devices, your [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=420.52s)]
*  smart devices all around your home are paying attention to what you do all day. Yeah, it's true. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=428.96s)]
*  John Chase and our colleagues at Wirecutter, the Times product review site, have been taking [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  a new look at all those smart internet connected devices in our homes. The same qualities that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=438.44s)]
*  make them super useful, like how they know where you are, who you are, what you like, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  have also raised concerns about data privacy. John says that of all the devices they looked at, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=448.52s)]
*  speakers and cameras and doorbells, they were most surprised by what smart TVs are up to with a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=454.52s)]
*  system called ACR, Automatic Content Recognition. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=460.55999999999995s)]
*  These devices are collecting data on anything that appears on your screen. It could be Love [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=464.55999999999995s)]
*  Island reruns. It could be home photos that you've beamed to your TV, anything. Your TV takes [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=470.0s)]
*  screenshots of that stuff, sends it up to the internet where the data is harvested from it and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=476.32s)]
*  a profile is made of you. And then the TV maker has the ability to sell that profile to anyone. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=481.55999999999995s)]
*  It could be to advertisers, it could be to insurance agents. There's an entire data brokering [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  industry that loves to collect data on people and sell it to the highest bidder. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=491.96s)]
*  Understandably, most people probably don't like that idea. The good news is there are a few steps [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=497.76s)]
*  you can take to protect yourself. If a TV has ACR built in, by regulation, they have to allow [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=502.04s)]
*  device owners to turn it off. So buried somewhere in your TV settings, there will be an opt out [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=507.84s)]
*  option. The hard part may be finding exactly where it is. The best step is to go right into your TV [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=514.52s)]
*  settings and look for privacy. But sometimes it may be located somewhere else. If you aren't able [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=520.4s)]
*  to find it easily, you can go to the TV maker's website and ask for directions. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=525.44s)]
*  This is a good reminder in general that you should take precautions when you're using smart devices. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=529.96s)]
*  You might want to consider whether you want to share your location or what kind of settings and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  what kind of data the devices are asking for. And not just click yes blindly on every little check [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=538.52s)]
*  box. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=543.6800000000001s)]

*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. Inside Paramount's multi-million dollar settlement with [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=552.48s)]
*  President Trump. That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Urfjw2964&t=558.0400000000001s)]
