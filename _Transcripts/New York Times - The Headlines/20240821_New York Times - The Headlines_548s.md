# The Obamas' Back-to-Back Speeches, and a Secret U.S. Nuclear Defense Plan
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw)
*  I'm Julian Barnes. I'm an intelligence reporter at the New York Times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=0.0s)]
*  I try to find out what the US government is keeping secret. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=4.0s)]
*  It takes a lot of time to find people willing to talk about those secrets. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=7.0s)]
*  It requires talking to a lot of people to make sure that we're not misled [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=12.0s)]
*  and that we give a complete story to our readers. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=16.0s)]
*  If the New York Times was not reporting these stories, some of them might never come to light. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=19.0s)]
*  If you want to support this kind of work, you can do that by subscribing to the New York Times. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=26.0s)]
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=33.0s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, August 21st. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah, so just wanted to get your thoughts on the convention. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=44.0s)]
*  How are you feeling going into November? What's your mood? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=48.0s)]
*  A lot better than it was a month ago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah, oh my god, yeah. Definitely motivated to like volunteer a little bit more. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=53.0s)]
*  In Chicago, the Democratic National Convention is rolling on with a packed hall and enthusiastic crowds. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=58.0s)]
*  Somebody actually described it, they said they weren't expecting this many people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=65.0s)]
*  because they were really planning for more of a week. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=70.0s)]
*  And then the amount of enthusiasm and attendance that they've seen has just been so off the charts [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=73.0s)]
*  that it's more of a celebration. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=78.0s)]
*  The party's been riding a wave of enthusiasm since President Biden stepped aside [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=81.0s)]
*  for Kamala Harris to become the nominee. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=86.0s)]
*  And the energy has been on full display at the convention. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=89.0s)]
*  Hope is making a comeback. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=92.0s)]
*  Last night, the headliners were Michelle and Barack Obama, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=96.0s)]
*  who took the stage for back-to-back speeches where they praised Harris and zeroed in on Donald Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=99.0s)]
*  For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=106.0s)]
*  See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=114.0s)]
*  two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who happen to be Black. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=120.0s)]
*  The former first lady called Trump out for, quote, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=126.0s)]
*  doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=129.0s)]
*  tying Trump's attacks on her husband's background to his recent questioning of Harris's identity. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=133.0s)]
*  And she brought people to their feet as she urged the crowd to make sure everyone they know [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=139.0s)]
*  has a plan to vote in November. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=144.0s)]
*  I am feeling ready to go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=147.0s)]
*  I am ready to go. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=150.0s)]
*  Even if, even if I am the only person stupid enough to speak after Michelle Obama. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=156.0s)]
*  The former president, meanwhile, credited Harris with rekindling the energy that carried him [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=164.0s)]
*  to the White House 16 years ago. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=169.0s)]
*  And he denounced Trump as whiny and selfish. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=171.0s)]
*  We do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=175.0s)]
*  We have seen that movie before, and we all know that the sequel is usually worse. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=182.0s)]
*  America's ready for a new chapter. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=194.0s)]
*  America's ready for a better story. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=197.0s)]
*  We are ready for a president, Kamala Harris. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=201.0s)]
*  Tonight, Harris's running mate, Tim Walz, will speak for the third night of the convention. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=207.0s)]
*  The Times has learned new details about how the U.S. government is preparing for a nuclear threat [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=219.0s)]
*  and where they think the threat might come from. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=225.0s)]
*  For decades, the U.S. had been mainly preparing for an attack by Russia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=228.0s)]
*  But in a new top-secret nuclear deterrence plan that President Biden approved earlier this year, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=232.0s)]
*  the government has shifted its strategy toward a broader range of threats, which now includes China. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=238.0s)]
*  The new nuclear strategy is what's called a nuclear employment guidance. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=245.0s)]
*  And every president revises one. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=250.0s)]
*  But since the last one was written, the U.S. has seen the nuclear world change considerably. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=254.0s)]
*  David Sanger covers national security for the Times, and he learned about the changes to the plan, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=260.0s)]
*  which is so highly classified that it only exists on paper. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=266.0s)]
*  There are no digital copies of it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=270.0s)]
*  China has undergone the biggest change. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=272.0s)]
*  It has been rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=275.0s)]
*  Russia has threatened the use of nuclear weapons, particularly small battlefield weapons, against Ukraine [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=279.0s)]
*  while developing new, novel nuclear weapons that could be aimed at the United States. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=287.0s)]
*  And even North Korea, which a few years ago had just a few nuclear weapons that it was beginning to test, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=293.0s)]
*  now has a stockpile of 60 or more, and the capacity to expand that dramatically. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=300.0s)]
*  That gives the North far greater strategic capability to strike at the U.S. or coordinate with Beijing and Moscow. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=307.0s)]
*  The big question is, can the U.S. handle multiple nuclear crises? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=317.0s)]
*  No one is certain. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=323.0s)]
*  Imagine, for example, that Russia is threatening to use a weapon against Ukraine or a NATO member, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=325.0s)]
*  and that China or North Korea exploit that crisis to make similar threats against Taiwan or South Korea. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=333.0s)]
*  David says that in response to the growing threats, the U.S. has moved to deploy more conventional weapons in places like Germany and Japan. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=341.0s)]
*  He said there have also been attempts to use diplomatic efforts to lower the temperature, but so far those have mostly gone nowhere. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=351.0s)]
*  The Biden administration's effort to ban non-compete agreements hit a wall yesterday [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=363.0s)]
*  when a federal judge in Texas blocked the ban from going into effect. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=368.0s)]
*  Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission issued a rule prohibiting most companies from mandating that their employees sign non-competes, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=373.0s)]
*  contracts that limit their ability to go work for rival companies. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=381.0s)]
*  The contracts have become incredibly common in recent years. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=385.0s)]
*  The FTC estimated that one in five Americans deal with them, including everyone from hairdressers to computer engineers to company executives. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=389.0s)]
*  FTC chair Lena Kahn argued getting rid of non-competes would lead to more innovation and new startups [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=398.0s)]
*  and could increase workers' earnings by $400 billion over the next decade. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=405.0s)]
*  But the judge's decision, which upholds a ruling from earlier this summer, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=411.0s)]
*  says that the FTC lacks the authority to put this kind of rule in place. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=415.0s)]
*  A spokesman for the commission said that it is, quote, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=420.0s)]
*  A new study has found a link between diabetes and eating meat, specifically red meat like steak or processed meat like sausage or bacon. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=431.0s)]
*  The study, published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology this week, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=440.0s)]
*  looked at research data for two million adults across 20 countries, including the U.S. and parts of Europe and Asia. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=444.0s)]
*  After adjusting for risk factors like smoking or physical inactivity, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=451.0s)]
*  they found that for every three and a half ounces of red meat someone ate each day, like a small steak, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=456.0s)]
*  their risk of getting type 2 diabetes increased by 10 percent. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=462.0s)]
*  And for roughly every two ounces of processed meat that someone ate each day, like a sausage or a couple slices of bacon, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=467.0s)]
*  their risk increased by 15 percent. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=474.0s)]
*  The data also suggested consuming poultry was associated with increased risk, but the finding was less consistent. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=477.0s)]
*  A researcher who led the study said there are a couple of possible explanations. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=484.0s)]
*  People who eat more meat may also be eating fewer fruits and vegetables. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=488.0s)]
*  Another is that cooking meat at high temperatures like frying and grilling can form compounds that can damage cells and contribute to type 2 diabetes. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=493.0s)]
*  There are also other proposed explanations related to saturated fat levels and a specific iron compound. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=502.0s)]
*  A medical professor and cardiologist not involved with the study told the Times, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=508.0s)]
*  this does not mean you should never eat processed meat, if that's your thing, but to instead think of it as an occasional treat. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=513.0s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=521.0s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at the strategy behind Ukraine's surprise attacks into Russia [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=524.0s)]
*  and how Russian President Vladimir Putin may respond. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=530.0s)]
*  You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=534.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2uacFGlyw&t=538.0s)]
