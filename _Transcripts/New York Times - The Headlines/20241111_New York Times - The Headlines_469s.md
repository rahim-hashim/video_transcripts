# Trump Transition Stalls Over Ethics Code, and a New Russian Offensive
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, November [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=0.0s)]
*  11th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=7.44s)]
*  Donald Trump, who promised a broad crackdown on immigration while running for president, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=13.8s)]
*  has now named a border czar to carry out his policies. The president-elect made the announcement [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=18.72s)]
*  in a social media post last night, just before midnight, saying Thomas Homan will be in charge [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  of the country's borders. Homan has worked in law enforcement for over 30 years, including [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=29.62s)]
*  as a border patrol agent, and he served as a senior immigration official in Trump's last [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=35.14s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=40.22s)]
*  President Trump is going to end the Biden-Harris open border madness. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=41.22s)]
*  At this summer's Republican National Convention, Homan vigorously endorsed Trump's calls for [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  mass deportations. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=50.78s)]
*  I got a message to the millions of illegal immigrants that Joe Biden's released in our [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=51.78s)]
*  country in violation of federal law. You better start packing now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=56.54s)]
*  Homan also defended some of Trump's most controversial immigration policies from his first term, including [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=62.1s)]
*  the separation of thousands of migrant families at the border. The policy details for Trump's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=67.78s)]
*  next administration aren't yet clear, but Homan suggested in an interview on 60 Minutes [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=73.42s)]
*  that the government could resume large-scale raids on work sites to arrest unauthorized [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=78.98s)]
*  workers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=84.38s)]
*  I don't use the term raids, but you're probably talking about worksite enforcement operations, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=85.38s)]
*  which this administration pretty much stopped. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=90.1s)]
*  Workplace enforcement, that's a roundup. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=92.74s)]
*  And that's going to be necessary. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=94.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, over the weekend, Arizona was called for Trump, giving him a victory in all seven [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=97.58s)]
*  swing states. President Biden has invited Trump to the White House this week for a meeting, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=106.82s)]
*  a traditional part of the handover of power. But there's an issue holding up the transition [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=112.58s)]
*  process. Trump has not yet submitted a legally required ethics pledge that states he will [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=117.66s)]
*  avoid conflicts of interest while in office. Congress added that requirement in 2019, in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=123.7s)]
*  part because of ethics concerns during Trump's first administration. One watchdog group identified [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=129.98s)]
*  more than 3,400 conflicts of interest during that time. Trump's transition team was supposed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=136.02s)]
*  to submit the ethics plan by October 1st, and until they do, the Biden administration [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=142.06s)]
*  legally cannot share classified intelligence or give Trump's team early access to the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=147.46s)]
*  federal agencies they'll soon control. Without that prep, Trump's team will basically be [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=152.94s)]
*  forced to come in cold when they take over in January, which experts say could leave [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=158.54s)]
*  the country vulnerable as the new administration comes in. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=163.2s)]
*  When world leaders arrive today for COP29, the top thing on everyone's mind is the election [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=172.06s)]
*  of Donald J. Trump in the United States. What it means is that the world's largest emitter [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=180.82s)]
*  of carbon dioxide in history will soon no longer participate in the fight against climate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=185.74s)]
*  change. Times climate reporter Lisa Friedman is covering [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=192.94s)]
*  COP29, the global climate talks that kick off today in Azerbaijan. She says that the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=196.54s)]
*  U.S. is basically set to make a 180 as Trump, who's called climate change a hoax and promised [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  to make it easier to burn coal, prepares to take office. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  Right now, with the beginning of these negotiations, countries are hoping to unlock billions or [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=212.89999999999998s)]
*  even trillions of dollars to help transition the world to clean energy and protect the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  most vulnerable countries from the ravages of climate change. Because the Biden administration [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=224.14s)]
*  is essentially a lame duck, those discussions are now viewed as harder to achieve an agreement [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=229.5s)]
*  on. So that's the short term. But in the long term, and not even that long, if the United [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=236.05999999999997s)]
*  States is not working at a national level to cut emissions and encouraging other countries [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=241.33999999999997s)]
*  to do the same, there's a real question of whether the world can avoid busting through [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  what's considered the safe limits of climate change. Scientists are telling us that for [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=252.26s)]
*  every fraction of a degree of warming, the severity of dangers will rise. Flooding, droughts, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=256.9s)]
*  heat waves, wildfires. Look at this past year alone. There was massive flooding in Brazil, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=263.9s)]
*  disastrous flooding in Spain. In the United States, we had back to back hurricanes, Helene [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  and Milton. If emissions don't go down, disasters like these will continue and will get worse. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=276.7s)]
*  In Russia, 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, are preparing to launch a major [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=291.74s)]
*  offensive against Ukrainian forces. Their goal? To take back the Russian territory that Ukraine [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=298.06s)]
*  managed to seize earlier this year. The attack is expected to begin in the next few days. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=304.46s)]
*  The Ukrainians had hoped that their push into Russia this summer would force Moscow to pull [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  troops away from the front lines to defend its own territory. Instead, US officials tell the Times [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=315.18s)]
*  that Russia has been able to prepare the coming assault without weakening its other positions, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=321.34s)]
*  in part thanks to the thousands of North Korean soldiers who've been called up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=326.46s)]
*  North Korea's army hasn't been involved in ground combat in decades, but Russia's given them machine [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  guns, anti-tank missiles and other weapons, and trained them in basic infantry tactics and trench [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  clearing. If they manage to push the Ukrainians back, it's not clear if the North Korean troops [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=342.94s)]
*  will stop at the border or if the North Korean government has authorized them to fight in Ukraine [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=348.86s)]
*  itself. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=354.62s)]
*  This weekend, the Women's Tennis Association Finals played out in the capital of Saudi Arabia [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=372.62s)]
*  in a sold-out match. But the location of the tournament came with controversy. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=377.98s)]
*  The women were playing in a country where progress on women's rights is still stop and go. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=388.14000000000004s)]
*  Saudi women have been pouring into the workforce in record numbers recently, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=394.06s)]
*  and they got the right to drive a few years ago. But they still need the permission of a male [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=398.3s)]
*  guardian to marry, and prominent women's rights activists have been jailed. In recent years, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=402.94s)]
*  critics have accused Saudi Arabia of trying to sportswash its human rights record, investing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=408.3s)]
*  billions of dollars in golf, soccer, boxing, car racing, and now tennis as a distraction. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=413.66s)]
*  The kingdom struck a deal to host the WTA Finals, in part by promising some $15 million [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=420.46s)]
*  in overall prize money, the highest winnings in the history of women's tennis. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=426.3s)]
*  Coco Goff, who ultimately won, weighed the pros and cons of playing in Saudi Arabia before she [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=431.97999999999996s)]
*  arrived, saying she had reservations about the country's record on women's rights as well as [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=437.18s)]
*  LGBTQ rights. But she said she also looked forward to promoting the sport to young girls in a new place. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=442.38s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, how Democrats are now arguing over the party's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=451.18s)]
*  direction after the sweeping losses of last week. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQIpZu8kcc&t=456.54s)]
