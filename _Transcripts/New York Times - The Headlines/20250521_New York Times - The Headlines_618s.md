# Trump Scolds Party Over Bill, Judge Warns on Deportations, George Wendt Dies at 76 | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today is Wednesday, May [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=0.0s)]
*  21st. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=7.2s)]
*  In the House of Representatives, Republican leadership is trying everything they can to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=14.24s)]
*  push through the spending legislation that's key to President Trump's policy agenda. It's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=18.56s)]
*  supposed to deliver on a lot of Trump's campaign promises, like tax cuts, including eliminating [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  taxes on tips and overtime pay. It also raises spending on military and immigration enforcement [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=29.24s)]
*  while cutting funds for Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy initiatives. But even after [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=35.32s)]
*  days of negotiations, there's still a small but significant number of Republican holdouts, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=40.8s)]
*  most of whom want to see deeper cuts. The GOP can't afford not to have their support [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=46.56s)]
*  with the narrow margin in the House. So yesterday, the president himself went to Capitol Hill [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=51.72s)]
*  to try and bring the pressure. And in a closed door meeting with Republicans, Trump made [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=56.4s)]
*  clear he sees the package as a loyalty test to him, saying anyone who won't get on board, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  quote, wouldn't be a Republican much longer. We're told from people who were in the meeting [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=73.64s)]
*  that the president didn't mince words and didn't hold back. But the question is, did [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=78.0s)]
*  the pressure from the president and this face to face conversation have any impact? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=82.32s)]
*  Robert Jemison covers Congress for the Times. President Trump does have a successful history [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=87.44s)]
*  of swaying Republicans in the House when it comes to pieces of legislation. But this time, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=92.44s)]
*  it's a little bit different because the stakes are much higher. This is probably one of the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=97.3s)]
*  best chances Republicans may have during his entire administration to enact so many of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=101.56s)]
*  these policy agendas. And it comes with a significantly large price tag. And some Republicans [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=107.32s)]
*  say that they won't budge until they can scale some of those pieces back and enact more savings. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  One of the biggest points of debate about the bill is what it will mean for Medicaid. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  Ten million Americans are expected to lose their insurance if it passes as written. And [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=122.88s)]
*  some of the GOP holdouts want even more Medicaid changes, while more moderate Republicans have [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  been fighting that. The president seems to be on their side. One lawmaker in the meeting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=132.76s)]
*  said Trump told the holdouts, quote, don't cut Medicaid, just shut up about it. At the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  Capitol, the Rules Committee met all night to try and hash out potential compromises [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=143.84s)]
*  around the bill. House Speaker Mike Johnson has insisted that it get a full vote this [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=148.06s)]
*  week before Memorial Day. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=152.72s)]
*  In federal court in Boston yesterday, a judge ordered the Trump administration to stop what [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=159.5s)]
*  migrants lawyers said was another attempt to deport people to countries they are not [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=164.54s)]
*  from. His order came as an unknown number of migrants were being flown to an unknown [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=169.48s)]
*  destination. Immigration lawyers at the hearing said at least two migrants had been told they [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=175.14s)]
*  were being sent to South Sudan, where neither is from, a country the State Department advises [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=180.04s)]
*  people not to travel to due to violence. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=185.16s)]
*  This was a pretty chaotic hearing. The judge asked repeatedly where the plane was. The [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=187.94s)]
*  government at one point said that that information was classified. Then there was a break. They [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=194.3s)]
*  brought in the general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, who said he didn't know [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  if the information was classified, but that it didn't really matter for the purposes of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=204.3s)]
*  the hearing because he didn't know where the plane was. So the judge had a lot of questions [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=208.46s)]
*  and the government did not have the answers he wanted. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=213.94s)]
*  My colleague, Mathathai Schwartz, was covering the hearing. He says that last month, the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  same judge, Brian Murphy, ordered the government not to deport people to third party countries [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  like El Salvador, where they'd sent some flights without giving migrants enough time to challenge [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=226.82000000000002s)]
*  that. The judge warned the latest flight may have violated his order, saying, quote, based [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=232.02s)]
*  on what had been told, this seems like it may be contempt. He did not order the plane [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  to turn around, but he did say any migrants in Department of Homeland Security custody [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=241.98s)]
*  must not leave U.S. control once the plane landed, at least until a hearing today to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=247.57999999999998s)]
*  determine if they received adequate due process. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=253.1s)]
*  Secretary Noem, the White House deputy chief of staff recently said that the Trump administration [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=258.18s)]
*  is actively looking at suspending habeas corpus. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=263.74s)]
*  Kristi Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, faced questions yesterday [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=267.94s)]
*  from senators about the administration's efforts to speed up deportations, and she [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=272.3s)]
*  misstated a key legal principle. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=277.54s)]
*  So, Secretary Noem, what is habeas corpus? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=280.14s)]
*  Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=283.18s)]
*  people from this country and suspend their right to suspend their right to suspend their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=289.18s)]
*  Noem incorrectly described habeas corpus as a presidential authority to remove people [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=293.18s)]
*  from the U.S. It's actually a foundational principle of the Constitution that protects [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=298.14000000000004s)]
*  people from unlawful detention. Only Congress has the power to suspend it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  Now, three more quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=318.62s)]
*  Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles, even [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=322.1s)]
*  if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=327.06s)]
*  In the Oval Office yesterday, President Trump unveiled plans for a nationwide air defense [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  system dubbed the Golden Dome. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=337.74s)]
*  He said the project would get an initial $25 billion from the spending bill that's currently [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=340.58000000000004s)]
*  in front of Congress and that he's confident the system will be operational by the end [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=345.26000000000005s)]
*  of his term. But federal officials have estimated it could cost upwards of half a trillion dollars [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=349.58s)]
*  to get it fully up and running. And while it's modeled off of Israel's so-called Iron Dome, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=355.26s)]
*  covering the U.S., which is 400 times larger, will present major technical challenges. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=360.85999999999996s)]
*  Also, in terms of political spending, I'm going to do a lot less in the future. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=367.9s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=373.02s)]
*  I think I've done enough. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  In the latest sign that Elon Musk is taking a step back from politics, he said in interviews [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=377.18s)]
*  on Tuesday that he's planning to wind down his campaign contributions and spend less [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=382.3s)]
*  time in Washington, D.C. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=387.14s)]
*  Musk was the biggest donor of the 2024 election and was a fixture of Trump's first months [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  in office. But the slash and burn campaign that his Department of Government efficiency [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=395.18s)]
*  carried out has generated intense political backlash that has threatened the profits of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=399.54s)]
*  some of his companies. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=404.26s)]
*  And for the first time in the U.S., federal officials have approved an effort to ban [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=407.18s)]
*  people from using food stamps to buy soda and energy drinks. Starting next year, Nebraska [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=411.74s)]
*  plans to put the new limitations on residents who get government food assistance, and at [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=417.62s)]
*  least eight other states are also considering similar restrictions. This kind of ban on [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=422.14s)]
*  sugary drinks failed to get traction for decades because of pushback from food industry trade [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=426.9s)]
*  groups and people who argued that the government shouldn't get to tell people what they can [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=432.42s)]
*  drink. Under the Trump administration, though, with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=436.46s)]
*  and others saying they want to target processed foods and tackle obesity, the effort now seems [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=441.02s)]
*  to be gaining new momentum. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=446.06s)]
*  In Mountain View, California yesterday, I'm excited to share that AI mode is coming to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=453.97999999999996s)]
*  everyone in the U.S. It's a total reimagining of search. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=458.9s)]
*  Google announced it's making a major new update to its iconic search engine as it tries to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  keep up in Silicon Valley's AI arms race. The classic list of blue links that it serves [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=468.46s)]
*  up isn't going away, but now users in the U.S. will see a new tab called AI mode that's, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  well, a lot like chat GPT, where you can basically have a conversation with the search engine. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=480.53999999999996s)]
*  When chat GPT launched a few years ago, Google declared code red, warning that the rise of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=486.38s)]
*  chat bots could upend its search business, which brings in almost $200 billion a year. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=491.74s)]
*  It's been trying to figure out how to compete. Over the years, it's introduced some AI features [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=497.78000000000003s)]
*  of its own, like those little AI summaries that pop up at the top of searches. The company [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=503.02s)]
*  said that's been a success. It's actually led to people using the site more. Still, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=507.94s)]
*  there have been a lot of questions swirling about Google's turn to AI, even within the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=512.9s)]
*  company, including how they'll monetize the new features and the fact that AI chat bots [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=517.06s)]
*  often kick out answers that are just wrong. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=522.54s)]
*  And finally, the actor George went, who played a beloved beer chugging bar regular on Cheers [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=532.9799999999999s)]
*  for over a decade, has died at 76. As Norm, he arrived at the bar day after day without [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=542.08s)]
*  fail as Cheers went on to become the most popular show on television in the late 80s [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=553.44s)]
*  and early 90s. Norm was the regular guy, the everyman. Went once said, quote, he was the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=558.9200000000001s)]
*  prototypical slacker. That's why he was so popular. The actor was born and raised in [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=564.62s)]
*  Chicago, one of nine kids. He went to Notre Dame for a few years before he had to drop out with a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=570.88s)]
*  0.0 GPA. He got a start in entertainment at Second City, the improv comedy club in Chicago [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=575.64s)]
*  that's launched the careers of John Belushi, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler. But Went wasn't on stage [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=582.68s)]
*  originally. His job was sweeping the floors. Asked how he ended up in TV, Went once said, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=588.16s)]
*  I knew that I didn't want to do something that I hated. It was a process of elimination. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=595.0s)]
*  Salesman, no. Doctor, no. Lawyer, no. Acting sounded pretty good. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=599.24s)]
*  Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwGkDNsKUzo&t=608.44s)]
