# Trump Blames Ukraine, and More Americans Identify as L.G.B.T.Q.
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Thursday, February 20th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=8.0s)]
*  A dictator without elections, Zelensky better move faster. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=13.64s)]
*  He's not going to have a country left. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=17.56s)]
*  Got to move, got to move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=19.2s)]
*  Tensions are flaring between Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky over how to end the war [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=24.12s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=28.84s)]
*  On Wednesday, President Trump mocked the Ukrainian leader, called him a dictator, and repeated [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=30.28s)]
*  his false claim that Ukraine started the war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=35.62s)]
*  He also suggested that Zelensky is effectively ripping off the U.S. by asking for military [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=39.2s)]
*  aid. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=43.96s)]
*  Europe has failed to bring peace, and Zelensky probably wants to, maybe he wants to keep [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=44.96s)]
*  the gravy train going. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=48.84s)]
*  I don't know what's the problem, but he has a... [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Zelensky, meanwhile, said Trump is caught in a web of Russian disinformation about [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=56.04s)]
*  the war and said that he would, quote, like to have more truth with the Trump team. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  It was some of Zelensky's most open criticism yet of Trump, and it came on the heels of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=66.24s)]
*  Trump sidelining Ukraine while he pushes forward on negotiations directly with Russia. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=71.36s)]
*  I've been talking to Ukrainians about this remarkable about face that the American government [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=77.36s)]
*  has had on its position on Ukraine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=83.68s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is shock, anger, outrage. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  My colleague Kim Barker is based in Ukraine. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=91.0s)]
*  She's been reporting from the town of Buche, which became a symbol of Russia's brutality [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=93.2s)]
*  during the invasion. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  Buche was the site of one of the most shocking massacres by Russian troops in the early days [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=98.84s)]
*  of the war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=104.98s)]
*  They seemed to use Ukrainians walking by almost for target practice, and then they just left [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=106.14000000000001s)]
*  the bodies on the streets. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  I met a guy on Wednesday afternoon and he was really angry that Trump would sit down [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=113.86s)]
*  with the Russians and that the Americans would actually negotiate with a high level Russian [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=119.18s)]
*  team when the country that was actually invaded, Ukraine, wasn't even at the table. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  Mixed in with that anger about the pivot of America is this fear of like, what is going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=130.06s)]
*  to happen next if America, which has been Ukraine's biggest ally since Russia invaded [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=136.58s)]
*  three years ago, what happens if America actually stops the support? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=142.38000000000002s)]
*  Where will Ukraine be left then? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=148.94s)]
*  And I talked to one woman who said, if America abandons us, we're screwed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=151.46s)]
*  You talk to soldiers on the front line, though, and they're going to say, we're going to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=156.46s)]
*  keep fighting no matter what. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=160.26000000000002s)]
*  Also yesterday, President Trump continued to test the bounds of federal power as he [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=166.58s)]
*  moved to end New York City's congestion pricing program. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=176.46s)]
*  Since January, drivers have been charged a $9 toll to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=180.9s)]
*  It's designed to limit congestion and raise billions for repairs to the subway and other [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=186.62s)]
*  projects. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  The data showed it's working. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=192.48s)]
*  Traffic's been down since the program started. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=194.64s)]
*  But Trump has repeatedly criticized it, calling it a burden on working class drivers and saying [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=197.28s)]
*  it will hurt tourism and business in the city. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=202.76s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump's Secretary of Transportation said approval for the program will be revoked. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=205.6s)]
*  And Trump wrote on social media, quote, congestion pricing is dead. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=211.12s)]
*  Manhattan and all of New York is saved. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=216.12s)]
*  He signed his message, long live the king. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=218.66s)]
*  The White House doubled down on that, recirculating his post with an illustration of Trump wearing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=221.72s)]
*  a crown. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=226.74s)]
*  I'm here to say New York hasn't labored under a king in over 250 years. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=228.02s)]
*  New York's Governor Kathy Hochul was quick to respond. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=235.2s)]
*  I don't care if you love congestion pricing or hate it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=237.92s)]
*  This is an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=241.76s)]
*  In Trump's first month in office, he's repeatedly gotten involved in state and local issues, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=248.0s)]
*  some of which may be out of federal reach. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=253.84s)]
*  In addition to New York's tolls, he's also weighed in on California's water management [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=256.44s)]
*  policies over ruling officials there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=260.68s)]
*  And he signed an executive order calling for patriotic education in schools, when curriculum's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  generally been handled at a local level. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=269.64s)]
*  Last night, he even suggested the federal government should run the District of Columbia, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=272.48s)]
*  saying there was too much crime. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=277.6s)]
*  The district's governed itself since the 1970s. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  But Trump said, quote, I think we should take over Washington, D.C. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  New data released this morning by Gallup shows a sharp rise in the number of American adults [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=291.92s)]
*  who identify as LGBTQ. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  Nearly one in 10 Americans now say that's how they identify, almost triple the number [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=299.84s)]
*  from 2012 when Gallup began tracking it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  The increase has been driven in large part by young people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=308.52s)]
*  Nearly a quarter of Gen Z adults aged 18 to 27 identify as LGBTQ. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=312.0s)]
*  It's also been driven by a jump in people who say they're bisexual. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=318.12s)]
*  The survey also showed that 1.3% of people say they are transgender. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=321.88s)]
*  That's doubled in the last few years. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  The data comes as the Trump administration has moved to restrict transgender rights, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=329.72s)]
*  banning transgender girls from school sports teams and banning transgender people from [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=334.72s)]
*  the military. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump's new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  announced the government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, saying the administration [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  is, quote, restoring biological truth to the federal government. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=351.24s)]
*  But many medical experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, say that not everyone [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  fits into neat categories of male and female. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=360.52s)]
*  Now, three updates on stories from this week. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=366.64s)]
*  In the Middle East this morning, Hamas returned the bodies of four Israeli hostages who were [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=370.03999999999996s)]
*  taken on October 7. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  They include an elderly man and a mother and her two young children. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=376.55999999999995s)]
*  It's not clear how they died, though Hamas says they were killed in Israeli airstrikes [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=380.23999999999995s)]
*  while being held in Gaza. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=384.35999999999996s)]
*  In exchange, Israel's releasing a group of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=386.4s)]
*  It's part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=390.23999999999995s)]
*  This weekend, Hamas is expected to return six hostages who are still alive. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  In Panama, nearly 100 migrants who were recently deported from the U.S. have been moved to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=400.4s)]
*  a detention camp on the outskirts of the jungle. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=406.08s)]
*  The migrants are from countries like Iran and China, and some had arrived in the U.S. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=409.11999999999995s)]
*  hoping to seek asylum. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=413.48s)]
*  Instead, they were put on a plane to Panama City after Panama struck a deal with the U.S. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=415.44s)]
*  to take in deportees. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=420.0s)]
*  They spent days locked in a hotel before being transferred to the remote camp. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=422.16s)]
*  One migrant told the Times it felt like being in a zoo with detainees kept in cages, claimed [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=426.56s)]
*  that Panama's foreign minister denied. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=432.52s)]
*  And in an update on the plane crash in Toronto, Delta Airlines says it will offer [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=437.84s)]
*  $30,000 to every passenger on the flight, which flipped upside down and burst into [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=442.64s)]
*  flames upon landing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  Delta said the offer came with, quote, no strings attached. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=449.56s)]
*  No one was killed in the crash. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=453.32s)]
*  And as of yesterday morning, all but one passenger had been released from the hospital. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=454.68s)]
*  The investigation into the cause of the crash is still ongoing. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=459.08s)]
*  And finally, Mount Etna in Sicily has been erupting for the last two weeks. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=462.04s)]
*  This is something that happens regularly. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=473.16s)]
*  Tourists have flocked to the Italian island for decades to see the volcano in action. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  This time, though, there has been a flood of people, so many that cars are blocking the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=479.8s)]
*  roads and emergency vehicles haven't been able to get through. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  Also, the visitors just won't stay away from the lava. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=487.76s)]
*  Woo! [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=492.04s)]
*  Italian authorities have been warning that while it's an extremely beautiful sight, the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=493.56s)]
*  lava sizzling on the snowy mountain slopes, it's dangerous. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=497.76000000000005s)]
*  This week, they tried to ban people from approaching it. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=502.08000000000004s)]
*  But people keep uploading photos and videos of the eruption from places that are supposed [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLTH8hrpaAg&t=505.24s)]
