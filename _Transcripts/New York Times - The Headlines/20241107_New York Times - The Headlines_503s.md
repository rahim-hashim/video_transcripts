# Democrats Begin the Blame Game, and What Happens to Trump’s Legal Woes
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Thursday, November 7th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=8.2s)]
*  The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=13.92s)]
*  voted for. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=21.68s)]
*  But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=23.76s)]
*  burn bright. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=33.84s)]
*  In Washington, D.C. yesterday, Kamala Harris came out to address the nation after losing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  the election to Donald Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=41.64s)]
*  She spoke from the same stage at Howard University, where she'd hoped to celebrate a victory. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=43.88s)]
*  While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=49.68s)]
*  Many people in the crowd were in tears as Harris called on her supporters to continue [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=58.72s)]
*  what she framed as an ongoing fight for democracy, justice and the rule of law. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  And so to everyone who is watching, do not despair. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=69.48s)]
*  This is not a time to throw up our hands. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=74.16s)]
*  This is a time to roll up our sleeves. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=77.36s)]
*  What Harris was trying to do was to gracefully leave the stage and end her campaign. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=81.76s)]
*  But what she left behind is a party beginning to point fingers and launch recriminations [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=88.48s)]
*  against different wings and aspects of the party over who is to blame for Trump's sweeping [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  victory. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=99.24s)]
*  My colleague Reid Epstein covered Harris's campaign, and he spent the last 24 hours talking [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=100.4s)]
*  to Democratic lawmakers and party officials who each have their own theory about why Harris [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=105.64s)]
*  lost. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=111.16s)]
*  Among the conversations that I've had were Bernie Sanders complaining that the Democratic [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=112.36s)]
*  Party has become increasingly a party of identity politics, really talking about how the party [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=118.16s)]
*  needs to recalibrate around an economic focus. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=122.3s)]
*  Coming to the same type of conclusion is Seth Moulton, a congressman from Massachusetts, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=125.8s)]
*  who said that Democrats are out of touch with the American people, needs to do less preaching [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=130.12s)]
*  and more listening. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=134.68s)]
*  And one of the things that he said was that, quote, I have two little girls. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=135.68s)]
*  I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=140.88s)]
*  But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that, unquote, a really striking indictment [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  and something that had been sort of whispered in Democratic circles during this campaign, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=150.9s)]
*  but not really addressed head on, particularly when Trump ran tens of millions of dollars [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  in anti-trans messaging attacking Kamala Harris. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=161.32s)]
*  Reed says other Democrats he talked to had other explanations. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=166.4s)]
*  Some placed the blame on President Biden, saying he stayed in the race too long. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=170.46s)]
*  Others pointed to voters' frustration over the war in Gaza. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  And he says that with no immediate consensus about what went wrong for Democrats, the party [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=178.2s)]
*  is just starting what will be a difficult, months-long conversation about how to move [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=183.72s)]
*  forward. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=188.9s)]
*  Meanwhile, the transition back to a Trump White House has begun. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=191.16s)]
*  Yesterday, Kamala Harris called Trump directly to concede. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  His communications director said, quote, both leaders agreed on the importance of unifying [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=203.26s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=208.38s)]
*  He also took a call from President Biden, who proposed a meeting about the transition [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=209.88s)]
*  of power. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=214.06s)]
*  Trump has a transition leadership team in place, but they've been working largely out [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=215.7s)]
*  of his sight until now because Trump was superstitious about planning ahead. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=220.06s)]
*  Trump's broader transition operation is expected to include a mix of Wall Street executives, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=225.38s)]
*  traditional conservatives, and right-wing populists, along with other Trump allies like [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=230.34s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=235.62s)]
*  In the wake of Donald Trump's win, the Times has learned that special counsel Jack Smith, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=243.34s)]
*  who brought the two federal cases against Trump, has now begun discussions about how [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=248.24s)]
*  to wind them down. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=253.12s)]
*  The cases centered on Trump's alleged attempts to obstruct the results of the 2020 election [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=255.08s)]
*  and the mishandling of classified documents after he left office. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=259.8s)]
*  There is a longstanding Justice Department policy that prosecutors are not supposed to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=264.24s)]
*  pursue prosecutions against a sitting president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=270.68s)]
*  That's just simply for the reason that these prosecutions, while they might be meritorious, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=274.94s)]
*  would obviously interrupt and disrupt a president's ability to run the country. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  Times reporter Alan Foyer, who's been following the federal cases against Trump, says his [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=285.18s)]
*  presidential victory will almost inevitably affect his state-level cases as well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=289.82s)]
*  In Georgia, where he's also charged with trying to overturn the 2020 election, Trump's lawyers [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=295.42s)]
*  will likely push for that case to be dropped on the same logic as the Justice Department's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=300.38s)]
*  policy. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=304.92s)]
*  And Alan says a big thing to watch for will be what happens in New York, where Trump was [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=306.24s)]
*  convicted of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=310.76s)]
*  His sentencing is scheduled for later this month. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=316.36s)]
*  So Trump's lawyers are essentially going to argue that Trump should not face an immediate [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=319.0s)]
*  sentence in Manhattan because he's preparing to enter the White House. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=325.16s)]
*  And if indeed there is jail time that is imposed, well, how is he going to serve it while he's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=330.72s)]
*  running the country? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=336.72s)]
*  And so his lawyers will seek to sort of indefinitely put off the sentence being issued at all. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=337.72s)]
*  And you know, we'll just have to see how the judge handles that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  Today at the Federal Reserve, officials are widely expected to cut interest rates, which [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=347.16s)]
*  could give Americans some relief down the line on their credit cards and other loan [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=359.16s)]
*  costs. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=363.04s)]
*  It'll be the second cut in just a few months after the Fed kept rates high for years to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=364.04s)]
*  try and tame inflation, which has now been slowing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=369.16s)]
*  The last time the Fed cut rates in September, stocks hit a record high and any potential [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=372.5s)]
*  new boost from today's cut will come on top of the market surge from yesterday. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=378.34s)]
*  It's normal for Wall Street to rally after a presidential election when the uncertainty [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=383.9s)]
*  of a race is over. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=388.18s)]
*  But analysts say that yesterday may have been particularly high as investors look forward [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=390.02s)]
*  to factors like lighter regulation that may come under the new Trump administration. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=394.7s)]
*  And finally, in the suburbs of Dallas this week, a fierce competition has been playing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=402.5s)]
*  out that has absolutely nothing to do with politics. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=411.18s)]
*  It's the Pickleball World Championships, basically the Super Bowl of pickleball. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=414.94s)]
*  The sport, which is like a cousin of tennis, is the fastest growing sport in America and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=428.74s)]
*  it's trying to prove its pro status. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=436.18s)]
*  Most people just think of it as a hobby or a very loud nuisance, depending on how close [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=439.6s)]
*  you live to a court and those nonstop paddle smacks. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=443.82s)]
*  At this week's tournament, it is mostly amateur players, but there are top ranked pros too. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=447.54s)]
*  Some of them are walking proof you can make a living at pickleball. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=454.1s)]
*  One player, Ben Johns, will be paid two and a half million dollars for playing at the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  championships this week. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=462.42s)]
*  It's less clear if the organizers will make money though, which the president of the professional [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=464.54s)]
*  pickleball association admitted. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=468.82000000000005s)]
*  But he said that was not the point. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=470.98s)]
*  Quote, this is where we see pickleball going and what it can become. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=472.78000000000003s)]
*  And this is us standing behind it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=476.46000000000004s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=482.98s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a deep dive into who Donald Trump won over to win the election. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=484.5s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=490.38s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=495.26s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD_JY0kkB2o&t=496.26s)]
