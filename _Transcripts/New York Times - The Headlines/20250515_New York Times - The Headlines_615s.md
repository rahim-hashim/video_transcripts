# Birthright Citizenship Challenge, Testimony in Diddy Case, How to Win at Eurovision | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, May [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=0.0s)]
*  15th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=7.0s)]
*  At the Supreme Court today, the justices will take up a case involving one of President [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Trump's most controversial policies, his executive order seeking to end birthright [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=18.28s)]
*  citizenship. Since the 14th Amendment was passed more than a century ago, it's been [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=23.8s)]
*  broadly accepted that everyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, regardless of their parents' [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=28.96s)]
*  immigration status. But Trump has almost single-handedly elevated what was considered a fringe theory [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=34.52s)]
*  that the children of undocumented immigrants don't qualify. It's something that had been [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=41.64s)]
*  quietly batted around by a conservative think tank in California for years before Trump [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=46.36s)]
*  brought it up on Fox News during his first campaign. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=52.0s)]
*  I don't think you're right about that. I think it's going to be proven that you're wrong. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=54.96s)]
*  I can quote it. You want me to quote you the amendment? If you were born here, you're an American. Period. Period. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=58.96s)]
*  But there are many lawyers, many lawyers are saying that's not the way it is. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=63.72s)]
*  While Trump didn't challenge birthright citizenship in his first term, on day one of this term, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=67.68s)]
*  he signed his executive order, setting off a tsunami of legal pushback. In three separate [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=72.8s)]
*  cases, federal judges quickly blocked the order using what are known as nationwide injunctions, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=78.4s)]
*  keying up a legal fight that will now go before the justices. Today's arguments won't tackle [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=84.44s)]
*  Trump's theory about citizenship head on. They'll be centered instead on whether the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=89.8s)]
*  federal judges had the right to block the order. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=94.2s)]
*  The question for the court today is, does one federal judge have the power to freeze [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  a policy for the entire country? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  My colleague Abby Van Sickle covers the Supreme Court. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=105.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is arguing that these nationwide injunctions are an overreach, that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=107.8s)]
*  they are too much power for one single federal judge to be able to block the executive branch's [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=112.84s)]
*  policies. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=119.76s)]
*  On the other side, lawyers for attorneys general offices and immigrant advocacy groups are [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=122.5s)]
*  expected to argue that this is an appropriate use of such a nationwide pause. Because if [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=128.52s)]
*  a federal judge were to only block this for part of the country, that you would have a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=136.12s)]
*  patchwork of policies, in this case a patchwork of birthright citizenship policies throughout [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  the country. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=148.72s)]
*  Abby says that the outcome of this case could have profound consequences for any legal efforts [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=152.52s)]
*  to push back on President Trump's stream of executive orders. The court's decision on [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=157.44s)]
*  the reach of judges power will likely come next month. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=162.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, other cases challenging Trump's birthright citizenship policy are still working [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=166.0s)]
*  their way through lower courts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Now a few quick updates on Congress. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  The American people are counting on us to get this done and get it done quickly and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=180.56s)]
*  we are on target to do it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  House Republicans pulled an all-nighter this week to push forward a major domestic policy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=186.36s)]
*  package that President Trump has labeled the big beautiful bill. The bill would extend [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=191.6s)]
*  and expand certain tax breaks and pay for that in part by making cuts to Medicaid, food [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=197.24s)]
*  stamps and subsidies for clean energy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=203.44s)]
*  The Medicaid overhaul in particular has drawn intense criticism from Democratic lawmakers [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=206.48s)]
*  and even some Republicans like Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri since it would force an [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=211.6s)]
*  estimated 8 million Americans off their insurance. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=216.28s)]
*  These are working people and their children who need health care and it's just wrong [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=219.76s)]
*  to go and cut their health care when they're trying to make ends meet, trying to make sure [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  that they're able to provide for their families. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=228.32s)]
*  The legislation will now go to the full House where GOP leaders are hoping to get it passed [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=230.76s)]
*  by the end of next week, though they'll need the support of almost every Republican to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=235.32s)]
*  do so. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=239.76s)]
*  Also on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=242.72s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, how many employees have been let go so far? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=243.72s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=247.56s)]
*  How many employees have been let go so far from your... [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=248.56s)]
*  About 10,000 took the fork in the road. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=251.4s)]
*  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced fierce questions from [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  House and Senate committees yesterday about his drastic revamp of the department. Kennedy's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=259.2s)]
*  plans have included cutting 20,000 jobs, which is one quarter of the workforce, and collapsing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=264.48s)]
*  entire agencies. Democratic lawmakers accused him of undermining health programs Congress [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=270.48s)]
*  had already funded. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=276.48s)]
*  If you appropriate me the funds, I'm going to spend them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=278.08s)]
*  We have. We have. In the bill, you are cutting the NIH by $18 billion. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=281.56s)]
*  Kennedy defended the cuts, saying they were painful but necessary to address the federal [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  deficit. He also tried to claim he had not fired, quote, any working scientists, even [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=292.4s)]
*  though hundreds of scientists from the National Institutes of Health, the FDA and the CDC [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  have lost their jobs. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=302.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kennedy's testimony came the same day that the CDC released new data on [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=304.67999999999995s)]
*  drug overdose deaths in the U.S. It shows deaths plummeted by nearly 30,000 last year. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  Addiction specialists say some of that is due to changes in the illicit drug supply. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=316.08s)]
*  For example, some fentanyl on the street is getting weaker. But they also point to greater [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  access to drug treatment and overdose reversal medication. Some of Kennedy's proposed cuts [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  affect programs many believe contributed to the drop in overdoses. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=330.12s)]
*  In Manhattan this morning, the sex trafficking trial of Sean Combs, the music mogul known [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=345.16s)]
*  as Diddy and Puff Daddy, will resume with the cross-examination of the prosecution's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=350.04s)]
*  star witness. The singer Cassandra Ventura, known as Cassie, has spent the last two days [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=354.76s)]
*  describing often violent and graphic details from her years-long relationship with Combs. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=359.92s)]
*  She recounted wrenching descriptions of physical abuse, bruises on her body from that abuse, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=365.71999999999997s)]
*  and emotional descriptions about how she felt after the sexual encounters at the heart of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=372.88s)]
*  the government's case. She used words like disgusting, humiliated. She said she felt [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=378.12s)]
*  empty after them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=384.52s)]
*  My colleague Julia Jacobs is covering the trial. She says Cassie's been testifying [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=386.64s)]
*  about the drug-fueled episodes that Combs called freak-offs. Cassie claims that Combs [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  also blackmailed her with videos of the encounters to keep her quiet. Combs has pleaded not guilty [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=396.56s)]
*  to the charges against him and claimed the encounters were consensual. His lawyers have [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=402.48s)]
*  suggested that, in the past, Cassie's tried to use her accounts of violence to get money [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=407.16s)]
*  from Combs. She revealed yesterday on The Stand she'd received a $20 million settlement [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=411.88000000000005s)]
*  from him in a civil case in which she alleged abuse. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=416.8s)]
*  And finally. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=427.8s)]
*  Eurovision is the, how can I put it, Eurovision is probably the most ridiculous television [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=428.8s)]
*  spectacle in the world. It's an event held every year where dozens of countries submit [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  a singer to represent them on the world stage. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=446.48s)]
*  Times culture reporter Alex Marshall is covering Eurovision this year, the highly campy singing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=451.48s)]
*  competition that is also the most watched cultural event on the planet. It's got a [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=456.38s)]
*  long and storied history. Back in the 70s, it helped launch the Swedish pop sensation [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=461.7s)]
*  ABBA. It's also highlighted some lesser-known acts like the heavy metal dance act from Croatia [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=467.1s)]
*  known as Baby Lasagna. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=472.78s)]
*  Tonight there's a semi-final ahead of Eurovision's grand finale this Saturday in Switzerland. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=479.7s)]
*  I'm heading to Eurovision, so as part of my preparation for that, I've been looking [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=485.26s)]
*  back through the past 25 years winners to work out what it takes to actually win. There [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=490.2s)]
*  are some musical things that do help. When we did our analysis, we realised that a lot [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=495.98s)]
*  of the winners feature folk music or feature folk instruments. So it really does help if [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=500.12s)]
*  you've got an accordion or two in there somewhere. And several of the acts this year do indeed [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=504.94s)]
*  And what I think I've ultimately decided is you need to have amazing staging. I mean, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=510.3s)]
*  the Beatles could have been on stage singing Hey Jude, and they wouldn't have stood a chance [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=516.74s)]
*  in Eurovision if it was just them standing in suits playing away. What they would have [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=522.78s)]
*  needed would have been barrel loads of pyrotechnics going off around them, maybe a piano burning [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=527.3s)]
*  on stage, maybe a man in a hamster wheel inexplicably spinning behind them. To a lot of viewers, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=533.5s)]
*  the song is almost irrelevant. It's the madness of the performance, the brilliance of the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=540.88s)]
*  performance. Like this year's favourite, according to British gambling companies, is Sweden's [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=546.82s)]
*  act. A comedy troupe called Kai, who are singing a song about going to the sauna, and when [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=552.42s)]
*  they perform it, they perform on stage in a fake sauna with sort of scantily clad dancers [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=557.94s)]
*  around them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=563.94s)]
*  You know, that does tick all our boxes for what makes a great Eurovision hit. It's a [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=574.94s)]
*  spectacle, it has an accordion, and it's got an amazingly catchy chorus. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=579.4200000000001s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. What President Trump's ongoing trade war [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=587.94s)]
*  with China means for fast fashion and online shopping. That's next in the New York Times [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=596.34s)]
*  audio app where you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNn-iQ1cJL0&t=602.0600000000001s)]
