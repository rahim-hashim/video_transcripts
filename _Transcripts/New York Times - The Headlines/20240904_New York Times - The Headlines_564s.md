# N.Y. Official Accused of Aiding China, and Zelensky Plans Cabinet Shake-Up
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, September 4th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=8.0s)]
*  Linda, what do you have to say to the allegations? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=11.08s)]
*  Federal prosecutors have indicted a former New York official they claim used her position [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=19.0s)]
*  to benefit China. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Linda Sun worked in state government for 14 years, including for governors Andrew Cuomo [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=25.32s)]
*  and Kathy Hochul. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=30.32s)]
*  She was once Hochul's deputy chief of staff. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=32.0s)]
*  Prosecutors allege that during her career, she took payoffs in exchange for working as [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=35.68s)]
*  a Chinese agent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  They say she ensured that state officials did not publicly address the persecution of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=41.16s)]
*  the Uyghurs, an ethnic group in China, and she provided Chinese officials with unauthorized [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=45.08s)]
*  governor's office to make it easier for them to travel to the U.S. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=51.28s)]
*  Some of the allegations also center on China's disputed claim over Taiwan. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=55.84s)]
*  Sun allegedly kept Taiwanese officials from having access to the governor's office. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  For example, when Cuomo was invited by Taiwanese officials to a banquet, Sun didn't forward [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=65.76s)]
*  the invite and told a Chinese government official that she, quote, blocked it, according to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=70.98s)]
*  the indictment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=75.28s)]
*  In return, the FBI says her husband's businesses got millions of dollars, and the couple used [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=76.96s)]
*  the money to buy homes in Long Island and Hawaii, as well as a new Ferrari. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=82.0s)]
*  The alleged benefits even included multiple deliveries of Nanjing-style salted ducks sent [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  to Sun's parents. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Sun faces 10 counts of visa fraud, money laundering, and other crimes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  Her husband, Chris Hu, was also indicted for money laundering. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=100.0s)]
*  Both pleaded not guilty. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=103.96s)]
*  The charges are the latest in the Justice Department's initiative to stop the Chinese [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=106.42s)]
*  government's attempts to secretly wield influence in the U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=110.98s)]
*  In the last year, authorities have pursued at least three other cases against people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=115.16s)]
*  accused of spying or carrying out other acts on China's behalf, including running a secret [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=119.58s)]
*  police operation in Lower Manhattan that targeted Chinese dissidents. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=125.18s)]
*  One of Donald Trump's efforts to avoid consequences for his conviction in the Hush Money case [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=134.46s)]
*  hit a wall yesterday. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=139.42000000000002s)]
*  Trump was found guilty in May of 34 counts of falsifying records to cover up payments [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=141.78s)]
*  made to Stormy Daniels. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=145.94s)]
*  It was a state criminal case prosecuted in New York, and Trump's legal team has been [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=148.22s)]
*  trying a long-shot effort to move it to federal court in hopes of getting his verdict overturned. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=152.58s)]
*  But a federal judge rejected that yesterday, and turned down Trump's claim that the Supreme [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=159.04s)]
*  Court ruling on presidential immunity applied to the case. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=164.48s)]
*  The Supreme Court ruling gave former presidents some protection for official acts, but the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  judge wrote that, quote, Hush Money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=173.84s)]
*  bounds of executive authority. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=179.26s)]
*  Sentencing the case is scheduled for September 18th, though the original trial judge is currently [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  weighing a request from Trump to delay that until after the election. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=187.06s)]
*  Trump faces a possible sentence of probation up to four years in prison. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=192.2s)]
*  In Gaza, the emergency effort to vaccinate children against polio is going better than [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=202.74s)]
*  expected, according to the World Health Organization. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=207.72s)]
*  This Sunday, more than 160,000 kids have been vaccinated, a significant portion of the 640,000 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=212.26s)]
*  that health workers hope to eventually reach. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=218.78s)]
*  The WHO has arranged for Israel and Hamas to pause fighting in certain areas at certain [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=221.98s)]
*  times of day to allow families to reach vaccination sites safely. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=227.92s)]
*  The effort comes as there's been a surge in infectious diseases like polio in Gaza, accelerated [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  by the destruction of health care facilities and unsanitary conditions. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=239.04s)]
*  In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky is shaking up his cabinet in the biggest change [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=252.04s)]
*  to his government since Russia invaded. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=256.78s)]
*  Half a dozen senior officials have offered to resign, including the country's foreign [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=259.88s)]
*  minister. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=264.2s)]
*  The shuffle comes at a precarious moment for the country. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=265.72s)]
*  Russia has scaled up its missile and drone attacks in recent weeks. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=269.58000000000004s)]
*  Yesterday, more than 50 people were killed in a strike on a military academy in the city [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=273.44000000000005s)]
*  of Poltava, one of the deadliest strikes of the war so far. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=279.0s)]
*  When the strike occurred, many were in classes or were rushing to get to an air raid shelter [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=283.36s)]
*  and were caught in the open when the missiles arrived. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=288.76000000000005s)]
*  Andrew Kramer covers Ukraine for the Times. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  When we heard the news of this strike, we drove out to Poltava, which is east of Kiev, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=294.12s)]
*  and arrived late in the evening. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=299.88s)]
*  There were floodlights and exhausted firefighters were pulling rubble from the building that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=302.5s)]
*  had been hit and searching for victims of the attack. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=307.26s)]
*  The work stopped every 15 minutes or so while they listened for any possible yells for help [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=310.76s)]
*  from survivors who might be under the rubble. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=316.2s)]
*  It's been a brutal week for Ukraine with large missile strikes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  This is all going on against a backdrop of a very precarious situation on the front line [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=323.4s)]
*  with Russia pushing forward in eastern Ukraine and Ukraine having captured land inside of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=328.2s)]
*  Russia fighting to hold on to it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=333.96s)]
*  So there's a sense that the war has become more active in the last month or so. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=336.46s)]
*  And finally. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=350.5s)]
*  So the teleoperator is laying down with a mouse. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=351.5s)]
*  They're laying down those little breadcrumbs. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=355.3s)]
*  In cities like San Francisco, Phoenix and Las Vegas, so-called robot taxis have hit [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=358.5s)]
*  the streets in recent years. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=363.94s)]
*  But Times tech reporter Cade Metz has found that the driverless cars aren't always as [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=366.22s)]
*  autonomous as they seem. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=371.26s)]
*  So they can lay down the breadcrumbs, but then there are other looks like there are [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=374.3s)]
*  other controls here. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=378.26s)]
*  Escalate, go slow, pull over. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=379.26s)]
*  Those are also buttons that the. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  Cade visited a command center in California run by the company Zooks, a self-driving car [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=384.82s)]
*  company owned by Amazon, where human operators stand by to remotely help robot taxis get [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=389.94s)]
*  out of complex situations on the road. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=397.02s)]
*  Let's say there's a construction zone that wasn't there the day before. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=400.06s)]
*  Let's say an emergency vehicle like an ambulance or a fire truck approaches the cars in those [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=405.86s)]
*  situations may not know what to do. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=412.70000000000005s)]
*  And in those cases, they send an alert essentially to a remote technician who then can essentially [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=415.66s)]
*  see what the car is seen through its sensors. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=422.94000000000005s)]
*  These technicians can essentially guide the car, give it a new path to take around that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=427.3s)]
*  fire truck or ambulance or construction zone. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=434.1s)]
*  It's not something that the major car companies, including Waymo and Cruz, have been open about [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=440.14000000000004s)]
*  over the years. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  They gave the impression that these cars were completely autonomous. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=448.38s)]
*  They gave that impression because it helped them raise the enormous amounts of money needed [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=452.62s)]
*  to build this technology. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=458.22s)]
*  But now, as these cars are beginning to be deployed and as we've seen some accidents [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=460.82s)]
*  involving these cars, the companies are starting to describe this process in detail. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=466.26s)]
*  Now there are parts of this operation that the companies are still reluctant to talk [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=474.46s)]
*  about. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=479.82s)]
*  We don't know how many people are employed in these command centers across all those [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=480.82s)]
*  companies. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=487.34s)]
*  We don't know how much money is spent on them. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=488.41999999999996s)]
*  It's still an open question as to whether these robo taxi services make financial sense. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=491.34s)]
*  Billions of dollars have been poured into the development of these services. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=499.17999999999995s)]
*  On top of that, you have the money spent on the humans who not only remotely guide the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=503.94s)]
*  cars in certain cases, but the humans who have to physically go to the cars when they [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=510.09999999999997s)]
*  break down, repair them and so on. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=515.8s)]
*  In order for these robo taxi services to be financially viable, you want to take the driver [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=519.48s)]
*  out of the car and take away the cost of that driver. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=525.92s)]
*  But if that cost is then duplicated with other humans helping these cars, these types of [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=531.68s)]
*  services don't necessarily make financial sense. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=540.84s)]
*  Today on The Daily, how the federal government is fighting to control the technology that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=545.84s)]
*  keeps AI running. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWk6qYBa8iA&t=550.76s)]
