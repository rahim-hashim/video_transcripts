# ‘Conclave Fever’ in Rome, and a Plan to Send Migrants to Libya
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, May 7th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=7.92s)]
*  What we have in Rome right now is a case of conclave fever. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=14.68s)]
*  Over the last two weeks, Vatican City has been full of Cardinals. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=18.36s)]
*  They've been in the back rooms of churches spinning about what type of pope they want. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=21.48s)]
*  They won't say exactly who they want, but they'll get close by saying what characteristics [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=26.28s)]
*  they're looking for. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=30.96s)]
*  Around St. Peter's Square, you'll see reporters trying to ambush Cardinals on the way out [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=31.96s)]
*  of these daily meetings that they have behind Vatican walls. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=38.1s)]
*  In restaurants, waiters will also give you their short list based on who's been eating [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  there and what they're overhearing at tables. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=45.64s)]
*  Everyone's just desperate to know as much as they can about which way these 133 Cardinals [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  are leaning. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=54.38s)]
*  My colleague Jason Horowitz is covering the conclave, the Catholic Church's ritual for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=57.5s)]
*  selecting the next pope. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=62.18s)]
*  It begins this afternoon when the eligible Cardinals will be locked inside the Sistine [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=64.04s)]
*  Chapel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  They'll stay there and vote until a two-thirds majority can agree on which one of them will [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  lead the church and its one billion members worldwide. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=73.9s)]
*  The ballots will be burned after each round, and the chimney of the chapel will release [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=77.9s)]
*  colored smoke, black if there's no consensus, and white when they've made a decision. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=81.98s)]
*  Jason says it seems the majority of Cardinals want a moderate choice, perhaps with a touch [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=87.58s)]
*  of Pope Francis' progressive interests, but without his tendency to rock the boat as much. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=92.62s)]
*  Conclaves are always unpredictable because you never know who's going to come out of [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=98.62s)]
*  it as pope. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=102.06s)]
*  But this one seems especially unpredictable because there are so many new faces, so many [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  new Cardinals that Francis appointed from all over the world. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=107.92s)]
*  So because they don't know each other, it's harder to form new alliances. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=111.38s)]
*  Not everybody has such a good read on everyone's politics, their ideology, their culture. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=116.42s)]
*  There's all sorts of things that people don't know about one another. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=122.66s)]
*  And so these past two weeks have been sort of a learning process, a speed dating, if [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  you will, for these guys to decide who amongst them has the charisma, who has the leadership [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=129.7s)]
*  abilities, and who agrees with them on their vision for the church. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=135.06s)]
*  At the moment, the two most talked about candidates to replace Pope Francis are Cardinal Perilin [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=140.38s)]
*  of Italy, considered a steady, competent, if somewhat bland option, and Cardinal Tagley [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=145.5s)]
*  of the Philippines, who would be the first pope from Southeast Asia and who shares Francis' [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  dedication to working with the poor. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=156.14s)]
*  Jason says no one's expecting them to send up white smoke today, but if there's still [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=158.5s)]
*  black smoke at the end of tomorrow or on Friday, it's a sign that perhaps the unpredictable [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  nature of this conclave is making it hard to reach a consensus. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=167.7s)]
*  Early this morning, India said it had carried out multiple military strikes against Pakistan. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=175.7s)]
*  India views it as retaliation for a terror attack that killed more than two dozen civilians [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  in Kashmir a few weeks ago. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=186.26s)]
*  It's accused Pakistan of harboring terrorists, which Pakistan denies. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  In the strikes, India says its forces hit nine different sites across the region, and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=193.26s)]
*  Pakistani military officials said at least eight people have been killed. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=197.94s)]
*  India will now face Pakistan's very fierce response. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  In a TV interview, a top Pakistani official said his country would retaliate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=205.66s)]
*  Make no mistake, because our desire for peace should not be mistaken for our weakness. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  Pakistan and India have been arch enemies for decades, and there are fears that the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=215.73999999999998s)]
*  new surge in violence could lead to an all out war between the two countries, which are [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=219.46s)]
*  both nuclear powers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=223.9s)]
*  At the White House yesterday. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=229.66s)]
*  We had some very good news last night. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  The Houthis have announced that they are not, or they've been announced to us at least, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=233.18s)]
*  that they don't want to fight anymore. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=237.5s)]
*  President Trump said the U.S. had reached an agreement with the Houthis. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. will stop bombing Yemen, where the militant group is based, and the Houthis will [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=243.22s)]
*  stop attacking American ships in the Red Sea. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=247.5s)]
*  They were knocking out a lot of ships going, as you know, sailing beautifully down the various [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  seas. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=256.3s)]
*  For more than a year, the Houthis have been launching strikes against commercial and military [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=257.3s)]
*  ships along what had been one of the busiest shipping routes in the world, saying they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=261.14s)]
*  were attacking out of solidarity with the people of Gaza. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=265.54s)]
*  The attacks caused major disruptions to global trade, and in the past few months, the U.S. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=268.90000000000003s)]
*  had launched a billion-dollar military campaign against the group. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=273.54s)]
*  That was so intense, some U.S. military commanders were concerned it was depleting the Pentagon's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  stockpiles. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=282.18s)]
*  The Houthis are very skilled at propaganda, and they pretty much immediately began portraying [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=283.66s)]
*  this announcement from Trump as a major win for them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=288.62s)]
*  Almost to the, you know, the U.S. is standing down. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=292.02000000000004s)]
*  My colleague Vivian Neyreim has been covering the conflict. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=294.74s)]
*  Of course, the Americans are also celebrating it as a victory. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=297.82000000000005s)]
*  What actually sort of matters in terms of the effects for global shipping are two things [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=302.06s)]
*  that we need to wait to see, basically. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=307.62s)]
*  Are the Houthis going to stop attacking any ships at all? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=310.18s)]
*  Is it purely, you know, American vessels? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=313.3s)]
*  Are they going to continue to target vessels that they believe are linked to Israel? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  And then we also need to wait to see how the shipping industry is going to react to this [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=319.34s)]
*  degree of uncertainty. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=323.5s)]
*  Does this really change their evaluation of how risky it is to sail through the Red Sea [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=325.3s)]
*  and pass Houthi territory? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=330.78s)]
*  Or are they going to take the safer route around the southern tip of Africa, which they've [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=332.7s)]
*  already been doing for a very long time at this point? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=336.73999999999995s)]
*  Now, three more quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  The Times has learned that U.S. officials are planning to send a group of migrants to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  Libya as part of the administration's deportation efforts. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=350.62s)]
*  Many details of the plan are unclear, including the nationalities of any migrants that would [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=354.26s)]
*  be sent and where they would end up. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=358.74s)]
*  But Libya has a network of detention centers that have been used to house migrants who [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=360.86s)]
*  tried to get to Europe from Africa. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=365.14s)]
*  Human rights groups have called those centers, quote, a hellscape, where people have faced [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=367.34s)]
*  sexual violence, torture and even slavery. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=371.78s)]
*  If it goes through, the Libya operation would mark the latest deal the administration has [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  made with a foreign country to take migrants from the U.S. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=378.58s)]
*  Hundreds of people have been deported to a prison in El Salvador, and there have been [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=381.94s)]
*  early talks with Rwanda about sending migrants there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=385.46000000000004s)]
*  Also, my sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=389.62s)]
*  but we've got to de-escalate before we can move forward. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=397.22s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson and other administration officials are set to have their [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=400.58000000000004s)]
*  first formal trade meetings with China since President Trump hit the country with tariffs [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=404.5s)]
*  of over 100 percent, escalating the trade war between them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=409.18s)]
*  The tariffs have sent economic shockwaves through both countries, threatening to raise [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=412.94s)]
*  prices for American consumers and potentially put millions of people out of work in China. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=417.18s)]
*  The talks are scheduled for this weekend in Switzerland. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=423.02s)]
*  And you know those little blue stickers with a star on them that are on a lot of dishwashers [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=426.62s)]
*  and refrigerators? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=430.32s)]
*  They come from Energy Star, a government program designed to help consumers easily spot efficient [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=431.82s)]
*  appliances and save money on energy costs. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=437.18s)]
*  Now the administration has announced the decades-old initiative is ending as it guts [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=440.66s)]
*  programs that were designed to fight climate change. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=445.24s)]
*  The head of one energy efficiency advocacy group told the Times that Energy Star only [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  cost about $30 million a year to run, but it saved American households and businesses [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=452.34000000000003s)]
*  $40 billion a year on their utility bills. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=457.86s)]
*  And finally, here's an interesting job offer for you, depending on how much you would [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=461.14s)]
*  like to escape from the world and how you feel about smoked fish. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=473.7s)]
*  The owner of a fish smokery on a remote island in Scotland is giving his business away if [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=478.94s)]
*  you're willing to commit to living there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=484.38s)]
*  The island, Colinsay, has a population of 125, the majority of whom are over 60. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=486.62s)]
*  The owner wants there to be more young people, so he thinks the ideal candidate for the smokery [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTxK0foIqA&t=492.68s)]
