# Inside Trump-Harris Debate Prep, and Israel Strikes Humanitarian Zone
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, September 10th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=8.36s)]
*  Tonight in Philadelphia, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will take the stage for what [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=14.52s)]
*  could be the most consequential 90 minutes of the presidential race. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=18.98s)]
*  It's the only debate the two campaigns have agreed to so far, and it comes as the candidates [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=23.64s)]
*  are nearly tied in the polls. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=28.5s)]
*  The debate will be moderated by David Muir and Lindsay Davis of ABC News. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=31.1s)]
*  There will be no live audience and the candidates' mics will be muted when it's not their turn [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=35.3s)]
*  to speak. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=39.86s)]
*  My colleagues and I have been reporting on how Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have been [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=41.06s)]
*  preparing for tonight's debate and their preparations could not have been more different. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=45.46s)]
*  Times political reporter Jonathan Swan has been covering the 2024 campaign. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=51.42s)]
*  Kamala Harris has been holed up in a hotel with her team doing highly choreographed debate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=55.82s)]
*  sessions. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=62.5s)]
*  These have included replica television lighting, a stage, and even an advisor in sort of method [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=63.5s)]
*  acting mode playing Donald Trump, wearing a boxy suit and the long red tie. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  On the Trump side, it's much looser and basically it consists of them sitting around at his [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=77.98s)]
*  private clubs in Bedminster or Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=83.44s)]
*  His aides are at a long table, his aides and advisors. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=86.32s)]
*  He sits in a chair facing them and they bat questions back and forth. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=88.9s)]
*  He's had some interesting people in there advising him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=93.36s)]
*  The Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, Firebrand member of Congress who's been throwing sharp [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=96.36s)]
*  questions at him in these sessions to get under his skin. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=101.56s)]
*  And the former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii who has actually debated [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=105.24s)]
*  against Kamala Harris in 2019 when both of them were running for the Democratic nomination. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=110.0s)]
*  She's channeling a little bit of her and offering suggestions in these sessions. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=115.84s)]
*  The Trump team strategically, their main objective is to tie Harris to the very unpopular president [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=120.48s)]
*  she serves under, Joe Biden, and to associate her in voters minds with the most unpopular [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=128.68s)]
*  aspects of his presidency, specifically high prices at the grocery store, at the gas pump, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=136.2s)]
*  chaos around the world, particularly the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and also the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=143.52s)]
*  situation at the southern border. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=149.24s)]
*  Harris on the other hand, her team wants her to appear cool headed, presidential, and they're [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=152.24s)]
*  hoping to goad Donald Trump into making some of the rash personal attacks that he's done [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=158.32s)]
*  against her publicly and that he's also done in some of his previous debates that have [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=165.92s)]
*  backfired. So the Harris team is hoping to see that version of Trump come out and alienate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=170.2s)]
*  voters tonight. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=175.92s)]
*  The debate starts tonight at 9 p.m. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  Eastern. You can watch it live on the New York Times app or at NYTimes.com with real time [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=180.68s)]
*  analysis from Jonathan and the rest of our politics team. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=186.16s)]
*  With less than two months until Election Day, the Times has been tracking how Trump's been [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=188.96s)]
*  increasingly threatening to imprison people he says are working against him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  He's vowing that if reelected, he'll use the power of the government to punish his perceived [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  enemies. It's rhetoric he's used before, but recently he's expanded his targets and been [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=204.4s)]
*  making more explicit threats. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=210.24s)]
*  In the last month that rallies and interviews and on social media have been a big hit, Trump [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=212.24s)]
*  has called for Barack Obama to be subject to military tribunals, threatened Mark Zuckerberg [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  with a life sentence for donating money to expand voter access in the 2020 election, and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=224.08s)]
*  said that election workers, along with lawyers and donors affiliated with the Harris campaign, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=229.84s)]
*  could be prosecuted for potential claims of fraud this fall. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=235.12s)]
*  When he was president, Trump repeatedly pressed the Justice Department to prosecute his political [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=238.96s)]
*  adversaries. Those efforts largely went nowhere, but several of his allies have since developed a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=245.2s)]
*  blueprint for putting the DOJ more directly under White House control if Trump wins. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=250.64s)]
*  Early this morning, Israel carried out airstrikes on an area it had designated as a humanitarian [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=264.64s)]
*  zone in southern Gaza. The Israeli military said it was targeting a militant command center there [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=270.64s)]
*  and that it tried to mitigate the risk to civilians. At least 40 people were killed and dozens [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=276.64s)]
*  were injured, according to an official with the Civil Defense in Gaza. They say entire families [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=282.64s)]
*  disappeared in the strike, which left three massive craters. Video from the scene showed people [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=288.64s)]
*  searching through the rubble using the lights on their phones. The Israeli military said it was [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=294.64s)]
*  targeting a militant command center there and that it tried to mitigate the risk to civilians. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=298.64s)]
*  The area, near the city of Hanunis, had barely anyone living there before the war. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=302.64s)]
*  Then Israel designated it safe for civilians, and tens of thousands of Palestinians fled there seeking shelter. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=306.64s)]
*  In southern California, a wildfire dubbed the Airport Fire erupted in Orange County yesterday afternoon, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=312.64s)]
*  and it's prompted evacuation orders from suburban neighborhoods. The fire began just east of Irvine, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=328.64s)]
*  and it's one of several threatening the area right now, as the state goes through a prolonged heat wave [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=334.64s)]
*  that passed 100 degrees this week. California's already had a difficult fire season. Two wet winters in a row [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=340.64s)]
*  led to lots of heavy vegetation growing throughout the state. Then the scorching temperatures came through, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=348.64s)]
*  drying out the brush and turning it into fuel. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=354.64s)]
*  Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system at the heart of the iPhone 16 lineup. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=358.64s)]
*  At Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters yesterday, the company unveiled the iPhone 16, its first model with artificial intelligence. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=368.64s)]
*  With the ability to understand and create language, as well as images, and take action on your behalf to simplify daily tasks. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=376.64s)]
*  While other tech companies have already dived headfirst into AI phones, Apple's been moving more slowly. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=386.64s)]
*  Its artificial intelligence system, which it calls Apple Intelligence, will have a few key features. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=392.64s)]
*  It'll help with things like sorting through messages, offering suggestions or proofreading when you're writing, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=398.64s)]
*  and it will feature an updated version of Siri, the virtual assistant. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=404.64s)]
*  This is a big moment for the viability of artificial intelligence. It's something that the entire stock market [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=408.64s)]
*  has gotten swept up in and really enthusiastic about, but has not really gained traction and adoption. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=414.64s)]
*  Times tech reporter Tripp Mickel covers Apple. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=422.64s)]
*  So many tech companies have introduced AI products, but not really been able to get customers to spend money to adopt [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=425.64s)]
*  and use those products for a variety of reasons. Apple, on the other hand, often comes to an emerging technology later than its peers [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=433.64s)]
*  and does it in a slicker or more satisfying fashion that winds up getting people to use it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=441.64s)]
*  We saw this with digital music players and the iPod. We saw this with smartphones and the iPhone. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=447.64s)]
*  And we most recently saw this with smartwatches and the Apple Watch. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=454.64s)]
*  I'll be looking for feedback from customers on whether or not they're saying that the new features are helpful. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=458.64s)]
*  Anything that indicates that people are really adopting this and that these aren't just parlor tricks, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=464.64s)]
*  which is the way a lot of these other features have been treated by other tech companies in the past. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=470.64s)]
*  And finally, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=481.64s)]
*  Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=482.64s)]
*  James Earl Jones, the legendary actor with one of the most recognizable voices in Hollywood history, has died at age 93. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=486.64s)]
*  I am your father. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=494.64s)]
*  Jones's thundering, rumbling tones gave voice to characters from Darth Vader to the Lion King's Mufasa. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=500.64s)]
*  Simba, let me tell you something that my father told me. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=506.64s)]
*  But growing up in rural Michigan, James didn't speak for many years. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=511.64s)]
*  He stuttered so badly he basically stopped talking at age eight. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=516.64s)]
*  Then in high school, an English teacher coaxed him into writing poetry and reciting it out loud. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=520.64s)]
*  And we were both shocked. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=527.64s)]
*  But we also realized we had a way for me to regain the power of speech through the reading. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=529.64s)]
*  So poetry liberated you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=536.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=538.64s)]
*  Poetry turned into theater, and by the 1950s, Jones had moved to New York to be an actor. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=539.64s)]
*  Over the next half a century, he did everything. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=544.64s)]
*  He was one of the first Black actors to appear regularly on TV soap operas. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=547.64s)]
*  He did Shakespeare and August Wilson plays, and he voiced the Star Wars epics, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=552.64s)]
*  which he originally went uncredited for at his request. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=557.64s)]
*  He was incredibly prolific, at one point appearing in 18 plays over two and a half years, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=561.64s)]
*  and cramming half a dozen movies into a single year. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=567.64s)]
*  He collected Tonys, Golden Globes, Emmys, and an Oscar nomination. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=571.64s)]
*  He told the Times that essentially once he started talking again, he didn't stop, saying, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=576.64s)]
*  quote, It became a very important thing for me, like making up for lost time, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=581.64s)]
*  making up for the years that I didn't speak. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=586.64s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=592.64s)]
*  Today on The Run Up, hear from four undecided voters about what they're hoping to see at tonight's debate. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=594.64s)]
*  You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=600.64s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obysMBXVcRI&t=604.64s)]
