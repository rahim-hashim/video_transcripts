# A Game of Chicken With China, and How Much Plastic Is in the Human Brain
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=4.9s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, April 9th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=5.9s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=7.9s)]
*  I know what the hell I'm doing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=14.26s)]
*  I know what I'm doing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=16.1s)]
*  And you know what I'm doing too. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=17.34s)]
*  That's why you vote for me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  As of 1201 a.m., the latest round of President Trump's aggressive tariffs have taken effect, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=20.98s)]
*  leading nearly all of America's trading partners with significant new surcharges. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=27.22s)]
*  They're trade cheaters. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=31.84s)]
*  They cheated on us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=33.36s)]
*  They cheated with tariffs on us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=34.92s)]
*  With Trump escalating a global trade war, stock markets around the world have been plummeting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=37.12s)]
*  for multiple days. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=42.08s)]
*  But Trump defended his plan yesterday, repeating his claim that other countries have been ripping [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=43.72s)]
*  off the U.S. for decades. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=48.5s)]
*  But now it's our turn to do the ripping. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=54.599999999999994s)]
*  Make our country even stronger, stronger than it ever was. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=56.6s)]
*  Trump's taking particular aim at China, furious that the country has been retaliating with [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  tariffs of its own. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=65.56s)]
*  When Beijing didn't take his ultimatum to back down, Trump increased the tariffs on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  Chinese goods to 104 percent as of today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=72.3s)]
*  Now we're at this place where the total tariff on Chinese goods is more than 100 percent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=76.72s)]
*  It's just crazy, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=82.84s)]
*  But there's also no end in sight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=84.28s)]
*  Alexandra Stevenson is the Times Shanghai bureau chief. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=86.12s)]
*  She says the soaring tariffs could disrupt hundreds of billions of dollars in trade between [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=89.36s)]
*  the two countries and jack up the prices on everyday goods from baby clothes to paper [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=94.22s)]
*  plates that American shoppers have gotten used to buying cheap from China. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=99.22s)]
*  When you look at what the Trump administration has been saying, they're saying like we're [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=103.44s)]
*  teaching these countries a lesson. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=106.7s)]
*  They're going to come to us and then they're going to do what we want. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=108.34s)]
*  Beijing is saying no, no, this is their opportunity to show that they're not willing to back [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=111.56s)]
*  down, that they too are a global superpower and that this is not how you treat an economic [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=116.58s)]
*  superpower. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=123.28s)]
*  So if you want to talk, we'll come to the table, but not if you're going to continue [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=124.4s)]
*  to talk about punishing China. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=128.76s)]
*  So there's a huge amount of uncertainty around the world when the two biggest economies are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=132.4s)]
*  at loggerheads and that just doesn't seem like there's any end right now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=138.08s)]
*  Even as Trump's tariffs cause chaos worldwide, the president said more are coming. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=144.52s)]
*  Last night, he said he'd announce a major tariff on pharmaceuticals soon. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=150.16s)]
*  The IRS is preparing to give protected tax data to immigration officers, which could [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=164.16s)]
*  help the Trump administration ramp up its efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=169.68s)]
*  The personal details of many migrants are in IRS records because for years the government [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=174.96s)]
*  has encouraged them to file taxes that allowed the immigrants to potentially get tax refunds. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=180.6s)]
*  And for the government, it raised hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=186.4s)]
*  The private IRS data, which can include names and addresses, is tightly guarded under federal [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=190.34s)]
*  law, but there is a narrow exception for criminal investigations, and the Trump administration [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=196.06s)]
*  is trying to use that to get access. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=201.82s)]
*  According to one former IRS official, sharing the data would be unprecedented, and the Times [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=204.86s)]
*  has learned that several top officials at the tax agency, including the acting commissioner, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=210.54s)]
*  are now preparing to resign. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=216.02s)]
*  Now, three more quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=220.34s)]
*  I call it a beautiful clean call. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=231.62s)]
*  I tell my people never use the word call unless you put beautiful clean before it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  At the White House yesterday, the president signed a flurry of executive orders to boost [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=238.3s)]
*  the mining and burning of coal, which is one of the main drivers of global warming. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=242.9s)]
*  Trump has said he wants to revive the struggling industry, but experts say a major turnaround [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  is unlikely since other sources of electricity, like wind, solar and natural gas, have become [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=253.22s)]
*  cheaper and hundreds of coal plants in the U.S. have already been shut down. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=258.9s)]
*  Also, the administration has made its biggest moves yet against America's elite universities. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=263.98s)]
*  The Times has learned that it's frozen a billion dollars in federal funding for Cornell [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  and almost $800 million for Northwestern. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=275.46000000000004s)]
*  The pause on grants and contracts comes as the government is scrutinizing the schools [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=278.42s)]
*  for alleged anti-Semitism and for their efforts to promote diversity. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=283.3s)]
*  Cornell and Northwestern were two of dozens of other universities, including state schools [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  and smaller colleges, that the administration has said it's investigating. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=293.16s)]
*  And at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the administration notched another victory as the court blocked [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  a federal judge's order that would have required it to rehire thousands of fired government [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=304.5s)]
*  workers. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=308.5s)]
*  Like the other recent wins for the administration, this one was on procedural grounds and is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=309.5s)]
*  potentially temporary. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=314.02s)]
*  And my colleague Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court, says that's part of a pattern [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=315.86s)]
*  he's noticed as the court has heard a wave of challenges to the administration's policies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=320.8s)]
*  The court has retreated to technical rulings, minor rulings, ones that kick the can down [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=326.46s)]
*  the road. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=332.5s)]
*  And it's at least possible that it's doing that to stay out of the political fray and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=333.5s)]
*  perhaps most important, to avoid a showdown with President Trump, who has indicated he [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  may not follow the requirements of Supreme Court rulings. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=343.23999999999995s)]
*  Plastics are everywhere. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=353.78s)]
*  They're in our furniture, our food supply, our clothes, cosmetics, and they don't really [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=354.9s)]
*  biodegrade. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=360.38s)]
*  They just get smaller and smaller in the environment. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=361.54s)]
*  And because they're so small, they can get everywhere into our soil, air, into the food [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=364.34s)]
*  chain and into our bodies. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=369.62s)]
*  My colleague Nina Agrawal has been reporting on some of the leading research into microplastics [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=371.38s)]
*  and what they could mean for human health. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=376.5s)]
*  She recently visited a lab at the University of New Mexico where a team of researchers [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=379.18s)]
*  and toxicologists published a striking finding earlier this year. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=383.82s)]
*  After studying two dozen human brains, they found that the average brain contained roughly [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=388.98s)]
*  7 grams of plastic. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=394.38s)]
*  That's as much as a disposable spoon or five water bottle caps. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  Nina says that there are some caveats and the research into microplastics is just getting [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=401.58000000000004s)]
*  started. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=406.66s)]
*  But she said the lab then found a correlation between high levels of plastic in the brain [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=407.66s)]
*  and dementia. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=412.42s)]
*  They're also looking at possible connections to heart disease, fertility issues, and multiple [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=413.78000000000003s)]
*  sclerosis. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=417.86s)]
*  One thing that was really notable from the lab's research was that the concentration [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=419.3s)]
*  of microplastics in our brains is increasing over time. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=423.1s)]
*  They showed that from 2016 to 2024, the concentration of microplastics in human brains increased [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=426.94s)]
*  by almost 50 percent. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=432.66s)]
*  And that coincides with what we know about how plastic production has been increasing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=434.90000000000003s)]
*  over time. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=439.38s)]
*  It's estimated to double every 10 to 15 years. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=440.66s)]
*  Not all experts agree on what we can do to reduce our exposure, but there are several [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=443.84s)]
*  things that scientists say can't hurt. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  One is not drinking from plastic water bottles, especially when they've been out in the sun. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=451.52s)]
*  Another is not eating food in plastic. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=455.96s)]
*  But while we can certainly try to take steps to reduce our individual exposure, there's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=458.94s)]
*  a lot about plastic production that's not in our control. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=463.28s)]
*  And most scientists and public health experts say that that's something that has to be dealt [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=466.59999999999997s)]
*  with at the policy level. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=470.0s)]
*  And finally. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=473.84s)]
*  Wow, I can't believe it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=479.44s)]
*  I'm going through the portal. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=481.84s)]
*  The theme park wars in Florida are heating up. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=484.0s)]
*  Disney remains on top, bringing in 50 million guests a year to its Orlando parks. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=487.2s)]
*  But Universal is making a big swing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=493.12s)]
*  You'll enter underneath the Kronos, where all the planets will lie. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=495.84s)]
*  Its new park, Epic Universe, opens next month. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=500.12s)]
*  Its sprawls over 100 acres was almost a decade in the making and is estimated to have cost [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=503.36s)]
*  $7 billion. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=509.12s)]
*  The Times got a look before opening day. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ6xMysOw8Q&t=511.66s)]
