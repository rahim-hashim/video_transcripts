# Tensions for the U.S. and Israel, Why Homes Are Out of Reach for More Seniors | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Will Jarvis, in for Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=4.64s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, May 28th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=6.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=8.64s)]
*  Tensions between the US and Israel are flaring over how to stop Iran from developing a nuclear [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=14.32s)]
*  weapon. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=18.8s)]
*  The Times has learned that in just the past few days, there's been a flurry of meetings [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=19.84s)]
*  between top Trump administration and Israeli officials, as Israel's prime minister has [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=23.62s)]
*  threatened to launch an attack on Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=28.7s)]
*  From Israel's perspective, Iran is particularly vulnerable to a strike right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  Its regional allies like Hezbollah and Hamas are weakened, and an Israeli attack last fall [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  partially destroyed its air defense system. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=42.38s)]
*  But the Trump administration is pushing back, since any strike could derail ongoing talks [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=45.22s)]
*  with Iran to limit its nuclear program. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=49.88s)]
*  While those negotiations are still in the early stages, Israeli officials fear that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=52.58s)]
*  President Trump might be so eager to make a deal that he'll let Iran keep its enrichment [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=56.54s)]
*  facilities, something Israel thinks is unacceptably dangerous. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=61.019999999999996s)]
*  Earlier this year, the Trump administration waved Israel off of a similar threat to hit [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=65.02s)]
*  Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=69.26s)]
*  But since then, Israel has continued to plan for a strike, including potentially a limited [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=71.1s)]
*  operation that it could carry out without US support. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=75.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Gaza yesterday, chaos and confusion broke out as crowds of desperate Palestinians [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=80.54s)]
*  rushed towards a new humanitarian aid center to try and get food. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=91.30000000000001s)]
*  The center, run by a group called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, is part of a contentious [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=95.9s)]
*  Israeli-designed effort to open a handful of aid stations in southern Gaza after a months-long [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=100.78s)]
*  blockade that has pushed people to the brink of starvation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=106.14000000000001s)]
*  Amid the scramble, short bursts of gunfire broke out, and the Israeli military said that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=109.98s)]
*  its troops, which were stationed outside the site, had fired warning shots. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=114.86s)]
*  Inside the aid stations, private American contractors are providing security. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=120.06s)]
*  In the end, most of the crowd left the area without getting any food. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  In a statement, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said, quote, the needs on the ground are great, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=128.3s)]
*  and that it intends to increase the flow of aid going forward. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=134.2s)]
*  Now, three quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=139.98s)]
*  The State Department has announced it's temporarily pausing all-new student visa interviews as [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=149.98s)]
*  it expands its scrutiny of international students. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  The government has been scouring the social media accounts of people who want to study [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=158.78s)]
*  in the US and has revoked hundreds of visas in recent months, including from people who [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=162.42s)]
*  spoke out against the war in Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=167.14s)]
*  Some students with existing appointments will still likely be able to go through the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=169.78s)]
*  interview process, but for many universities, any cutoff in international students could [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=173.3s)]
*  deal a financial blow since they tend to pay full tuition and are a substantial source of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=178.46s)]
*  revenue. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=183.38s)]
*  Also, US immigration authorities are deploying a new strategy to try and quickly deport more [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=184.74s)]
*  migrants, ramping up arrests at courthouses. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=190.98s)]
*  Officers are now stationed at some immigration courts around the country, waiting for migrants [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=195.4s)]
*  to get through scheduled hearings. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=199.62s)]
*  If the judges dismiss their cases, the officers can take them into custody immediately, potentially [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  fast-tracking their deportations. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=206.94s)]
*  In a recent case in New York, a 20-year-old from Venezuela who was enrolled in a public [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  high school was arrested in a courthouse lobby. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=213.94s)]
*  He'd shown up with his mother, but no lawyer since he thought it would just be a routine [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=217.1s)]
*  hearing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=221.3s)]
*  And... [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=222.3s)]
*  As of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  removed from the CDC-recommended immunization schedule. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Tuesday that the government will no longer [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=234.74s)]
*  recommend the COVID vaccine to healthy children and pregnant women. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=239.3s)]
*  The decision upends decades of precedent. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=243.3s)]
*  Vaccine recommendations are typically made by advisors for the Centers for Disease Control [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  and Prevention, and the group was scheduled to vote on COVID vaccines in June. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=250.02s)]
*  Kennedy's announcement effectively voids that step. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=254.9s)]
*  The move means insurance companies could now deny coverage for the shot, potentially putting [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=257.38s)]
*  it out of reach for some Americans. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=261.92s)]
*  Kennedy, who's long questioned and undermined vaccination efforts, said he made the decision [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=263.98s)]
*  because there wasn't enough data to support giving the shots, though the vaccines have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=268.8s)]
*  been shown to provide some protections for kids and newborns. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=273.02s)]
*  For more on Kennedy's decision, including how medical experts are reacting to the news, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=276.98s)]
*  listen to today's episode of The Daily. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=281.82s)]
*  The Times has been covering a new twist in America's homelessness crisis, a surge in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=288.5s)]
*  the number of unhoused seniors. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=293.1s)]
*  In recent years, the number of people over 65 who are homeless has grown by 50%, and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=295.98s)]
*  one group of older Americans has experienced homelessness at a uniquely high rate throughout [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=301.94s)]
*  their lives. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=306.38s)]
*  Late baby boomers, or people born from the mid-1950s to the mid-60s. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=307.78s)]
*  They entered the workforce during the switch to the post-industrial economy where blue [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=313.02s)]
*  collar labor paid less and had fewer union protections. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=317.1s)]
*  Many of them were hit by the crack epidemic in the mid-1980s. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=321.26s)]
*  Housing prices soared, housing aid faltered. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=325.7s)]
*  There are a whole variety of things that happened in society that made this generation more [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=327.9s)]
*  vulnerable to homelessness. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=333.82s)]
*  Jason DeParle covers poverty for The Times. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=336.02s)]
*  He's based in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  Mr. Forrest, how old are you? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=340.02s)]
*  70. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=342.7s)]
*  It's Anthony? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=343.7s)]
*  A-N-T-H? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=344.7s)]
*  Anthony, capital F-O-R-R-E-S-T. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=345.7s)]
*  I met a man named Anthony Forrest who in one person seemed to embody a great many of the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  factors at play in this story of why one generation became at higher risk of homelessness. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=353.85999999999996s)]
*  How long have you been unhoused? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=360.14s)]
*  Uh, 10 or better. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=362.46s)]
*  He had struggled through his life with a series of low-wage jobs that never really led anywhere. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=366.9s)]
*  He was never in a union. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=373.41999999999996s)]
*  He didn't get a pension. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=374.82s)]
*  He was hanging out on the streets in a drug-heavy neighborhood right as crack hit. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=376.62s)]
*  Was arrested on several drug charges over the years, which just made it harder for him [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  to find housing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=387.62s)]
*  But he had one safety net. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=388.62s)]
*  He had his mother who had a career as a teaching aid and she had a union pension and she had [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=390.06s)]
*  a kind of solidity, stability that he didn't have. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=395.1s)]
*  He could always go home to mom's and sleep on the couch, which is what he did. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=399.1s)]
*  And then when his mom was in her early 80s, she had a heart attack, went to a nursing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=403.26000000000005s)]
*  home and Mr. Forrest was on the street. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=407.5s)]
*  Jason says that Anthony Forrest's story is not unique. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=410.66s)]
*  In a survey of homeless people over age 50, more than one in eight said they first lost [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=413.62s)]
*  their housing after the death of a friend or relative. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  For Forrest though, his years on the streets of DC might be coming to an end. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=421.5s)]
*  Recently, outreach workers helped get him on the list for a subsidized apartment and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=425.86s)]
*  he's now been tentatively offered a place of his own. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=430.26s)]
*  And finally, 29,032 feet above Nepal, a controversy is brewing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=439.34s)]
*  Last week, a group of British mountaineers flew to Mount Everest from London, scaled [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=446.02s)]
*  the world's highest peak and returned home all in less than seven days. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=450.38s)]
*  Their secret? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=455.42s)]
*  Xenon gas. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=457.02s)]
*  The team was part of an experimental effort to use the gas to cut down on the adjustment [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=458.34s)]
*  period for high altitude climbing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=462.82s)]
*  Normally climbers who want to get to the top of sky high mountains have to spend weeks [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=465.26s)]
*  at a base camp adjusting to the thinner air. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=469.54s)]
*  But ahead of this climb, the team got hooked up to ventilators and had an anesthesiologist [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=472.46s)]
*  administer the Xenon, which basically tricked their blood cells into thinking they were [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=477.18s)]
*  already high up. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=481.62s)]
*  The only reason why we are using this is to protect the climbers from high altitude sickness. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=482.98s)]
*  We can see people dying on Everest every year. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=489.54s)]
*  And this is maybe one step to improve this situation and to make climbing high altitude [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crVQ6TBifU&t=493.64s)]
