# Trump Won’t Rule Out a Recession, and a Crackdown on Campus Protests
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=4.8s)]
*  Today's Monday, March 10th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=5.8s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=7.8s)]
*  Are you expecting a recession this year? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=14.64s)]
*  I hate to predict things like that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=18.96s)]
*  There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  President Trump has declined to rule out the possibility that his economic policies, including [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=26.64s)]
*  waves of aggressive tariffs, could trigger a recession. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=31.72s)]
*  Our country's been ripped off for many decades, for many, many decades, and we're not going [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=35.36s)]
*  to be ripped off anymore. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=42.4s)]
*  In an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News, the president said that he was stopping America [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  from being taken advantage of in trade, but acknowledged that his moves could take some [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=48.74s)]
*  time to pay off. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=53.3s)]
*  His willingness to put tariffs on America's closest trading partners, even if he's then [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=55.32s)]
*  paused some of them, has been sending shockwaves through the stock market. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=59.88s)]
*  And forecasts from Wall Street giants like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs say a recession [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=64.6s)]
*  in the next 12 months has become more likely. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=70.12s)]
*  Still, Trump has promised more tariffs as soon as this week, and other countries, including [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=73.56s)]
*  Canada and China, have responded in turn. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  Today, China's retaliatory tariffs on a lot of American farm products kicked in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  Chicken, wheat, corn, soybeans and more are going to face a 10 to 15 percent levy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  That could deal a blow to U.S. farmers. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=93.88s)]
*  China is their biggest overseas market. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=103.8s)]
*  I know that these are dark days. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=105.8s)]
*  Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=110.36s)]
*  The trade war that Trump has kicked off was hanging over Canada this weekend as the Liberal [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=113.96s)]
*  Party chose its new leader. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=118.9s)]
*  Mark Carney will replace Justin Trudeau as the country's prime minister, and he's vowed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=121.08s)]
*  to push back on the U.S. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=126.18s)]
*  My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=128.36s)]
*  Carney's never been elected to office. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=134.28s)]
*  His background's in banking. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=136.28s)]
*  He led the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=137.88s)]
*  Federal elections in a few months will determine whether Carney will keep the prime minister [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  post. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=145.24s)]
*  Some Canadian voters have said that a crucial question for them going into that election [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  is, who will be the best choice to stand up to Trump? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=150.12s)]
*  This weekend, immigration authorities arrested a recent graduate of Columbia University, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=160.6s)]
*  who played a prominent role in last year's campus protests against the war in Gaza. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=165.52s)]
*  The pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil holds a green card and is a legal permanent [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=171.08s)]
*  resident of the United States, but a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security claimed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=176.36s)]
*  that he led activities aligned with Hamas, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=181.88s)]
*  organization. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  And Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on social media, quote, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  We will be revoking the visas and or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=192.6s)]
*  can be deported. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=197.88s)]
*  Khalil's lawyer told the Times that they haven't been able to find out where he's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=199.28s)]
*  being held and said his arrest is part of a broader attack on activism and free speech. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=203.16s)]
*  For the Trump administration, it's a significant escalation in its crackdown on what the president [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=209.64s)]
*  has called anti-Semitic campus activity. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=215.04s)]
*  On Friday, the administration canceled $400 million in grants and contracts for Columbia [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=218.44s)]
*  in response to what it said was the school's failure to protect Jewish students from harassment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=224.56s)]
*  Columbia's president said it takes those concerns seriously and will work with the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=229.64s)]
*  federal government to address them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=234.4s)]
*  In the meantime, she said the cuts will affect nearly every corner of the school. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=236.56s)]
*  In Syria, the country's facing the biggest flare up in violence since the fall of its [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=240.76s)]
*  authoritarian leader Bashar al-Assad. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  Assad was thrown out of power back in December, but in the past few days, his loyalists have [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  attacked the new government's security forces along the country's west coast, and those [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=259.84s)]
*  forces have responded with a bloody crackdown. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  More than a thousand people have been killed, according to an independent monitoring group. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  The majority of them have been civilians. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=272.32000000000005s)]
*  Syria is very on edge right now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=275.44s)]
*  The roads leading into the coast have been closed down. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=277.8s)]
*  There are new government checkpoints manning those roads. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=281.16s)]
*  Very few people there have been leaving their homes for fear of what could happen if they [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  do, and others in more rural areas where most of this violence has been happening have also [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=289.04s)]
*  taken up arms to guard their homes and their communities for fear of what could happen. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=294.86s)]
*  My colleague Christina Goldbaum has been reporting from Syria. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=299.26s)]
*  Most people on the coast do not support the armed uprising by these Assad loyalists, but [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=302.66s)]
*  many people there are from the same sect as Assad, and so they're worried that they could [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=307.86s)]
*  be caught up in this violence, even targeted by government forces, as they try to squash [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=312.58000000000004s)]
*  that armed rebellion. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  And people are very worried that this could spiral into another civil war after this three-month [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=319.46000000000004s)]
*  period of relative calm. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=324.78s)]
*  So right now has become this critical test for the country's new leaders about whether [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=326.65999999999997s)]
*  they are able to manage a situation, reestablish control, or if this becomes a broader conflict. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=331.32s)]
*  And finally, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=346.09999999999997s)]
*  When the movie Flow won the Oscar last week for best animated feature, it was a bit of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=347.94s)]
*  a surprise. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=355.46000000000004s)]
*  The scrappy little movie about a black cat who survives an epic flood triumphed over [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=356.74s)]
*  big studio hits from Pixar and DreamWorks. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=361.66s)]
*  And now, Flow has been finding a new fan base in people's pets. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=364.58000000000004s)]
*  People have been posting videos of their cats and dogs totally entranced by Flow. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=371.66s)]
*  Fishbone, a cat, was so engrossed, one owner wrote, that he moved his cat's tower closer [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=376.9s)]
*  to the TV so he could get a better view. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=382.5s)]
*  Sampson, a golden retriever, was also very invested, according to his owner. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=384.82s)]
*  One of the producers and writers of Flow told The Times, he thinks all of the animal attention [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=389.78s)]
*  is probably because the movie used real animal sounds in production. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=394.29999999999995s)]
*  The movie's actually all animal sounds. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=399.02s)]
*  There's no dialogue. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=401.46s)]
*  Just a cat, a dog, a lemur, a bird, and a capybara. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=403.06s)]
*  Time pet viewing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=406.66s)]
*  There is, surprisingly or unsurprisingly, a lot of content already out there for pets [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  to watch. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=413.54s)]
*  Dog TV is a whole channel, and YouTube's got a lot of mouse videos for your couch potato [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=414.98s)]
*  cat. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=419.94000000000005s)]
*  But Flow finally offers an Academy Award-winning option if your pet is more of a movie snob. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=421.02000000000004s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=431.18s)]
*  Today on The Daily, how President Trump wants to both dismantle and weaponize the Department [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=432.62s)]
*  of Education. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=438.14s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=439.14s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=444.1s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oopJ5wwFCw&t=445.46000000000004s)]
