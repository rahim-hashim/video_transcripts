# Harris Is Said to Choose Tim Walz as Running Mate
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, August 6th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=8.36s)]
*  There are two big things to watch this morning, the markets and Kamala Harris's pick for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=13.68s)]
*  VP. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=18.94s)]
*  First, the markets. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=19.94s)]
*  From the moment they opened in Asia yesterday to the closing bell in the United States, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=21.72s)]
*  stock prices plummeted. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=26.36s)]
*  On Wall Street, the S&P 500 had its biggest drop in two years. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=28.38s)]
*  Driving the dip was widespread panic that the United States economy could be slowing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=33.22s)]
*  down, which would shake the global economy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=37.18s)]
*  But as of this morning, some measure of calm has returned, with the markets in Asia on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=40.82s)]
*  the rebound from their sudden drops. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=45.54s)]
*  So Monday's market freakout was really dramatic, but it doesn't necessarily reflect what's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=47.94s)]
*  really going on in the economy. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=52.66s)]
*  Lydia DePillis covers the economy for the Times. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=55.22s)]
*  She says while data showed that hiring slowed in the U.S., that data is not the whole story. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=58.06s)]
*  The jobs report on Friday really spurred fears that the Fed had miscalculated and slowed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  the economy down too quickly and that the trajectory was going to keep on going, resulting [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=69.78s)]
*  in layoffs and maybe even negative job growth. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=75.72s)]
*  But that is not at all an inevitability. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=79.28s)]
*  Other economic data recently has been really healthy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  We got a GDP report which showed an unexpectedly high degree of consumer spending and business [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=86.66s)]
*  investment. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=93.58s)]
*  Perfectly healthy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=94.58s)]
*  We've seen lending data that shows that loan demand is pretty robust. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=96.34s)]
*  There's all kinds of indicators that nothing is fundamentally wrong. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=102.17999999999999s)]
*  It's fair to say that we're probably entering a period of more pronounced volatility, but [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=106.22s)]
*  the people who watch this day in and day out generally think that the economy is in a good place. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=112.58s)]
*  And as long as that remains true, the stock market isn't going to totally fall off a cliff. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=119.17999999999999s)]
*  It's just going through a bit of a rough patch. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  Also this morning, Kamala Harris is expected to officially announce her running mate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=128.02s)]
*  It's been a frenzied sprint to vet, interview, and finally select someone ahead of the Democratic [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=132.3s)]
*  National Convention. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=137.14s)]
*  The final contenders in recent days have been a sweep of governors. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=138.86s)]
*  Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro, Minnesota's Tim Walz, and Kentucky's Andy Beshear, as well [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=142.78s)]
*  as Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=147.94000000000003s)]
*  Whoever Harris picks will appear on stage with her tonight at a rally in Philadelphia. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=150.78s)]
*  In Washington yesterday, a federal judge issued a landmark antitrust ruling against Google, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  saying it acted illegally to maintain its monopoly on internet searches. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=165.22s)]
*  Over the years, Google has become synonymous with looking something up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=170.22s)]
*  You Google it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=173.98s)]
*  But the Justice Department claimed the company was keeping that dominance by paying other [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=175.26s)]
*  companies to have its search engine front and center. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=179.54s)]
*  It spent billions of dollars a year to have Google be the default on Samsung phones, Apple [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=182.92s)]
*  products, and other web browsers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=188.17999999999998s)]
*  The judge ultimately sided with the government, saying those payments hurt competition by [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=190.66s)]
*  blocking out smaller tech companies. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=195.26s)]
*  This is a really big deal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=197.78s)]
*  It's the first time in the modern internet era that there's been an antitrust ruling [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=198.82s)]
*  like this against a tech giant. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=202.54s)]
*  David McCabe covers tech policy for the Times. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=204.62s)]
*  So exactly what happens to Google still remains to be seen. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=207.62s)]
*  The judge decided he would make a ruling first on whether or not the company broke the law [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=211.06s)]
*  and then have a second phase of the trial in which he determines how to fix any problems [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=215.9s)]
*  he found. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=220.3s)]
*  So that process is still ongoing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=221.3s)]
*  Generally speaking, the options available to a judge include both structural changes [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=223.9s)]
*  to a company like spinning off or breaking off part of a company and changes to their [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=227.66s)]
*  behavior demanding that they no longer engage in certain practices. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=231.62s)]
*  The other important questionnaire is how does this law that is in some cases more than a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=236.22s)]
*  century old really apply to the dominant tech platforms of today? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=240.78s)]
*  And what the judge found in this case is that they can be applied. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=245.22s)]
*  And it's a big vote of confidence in these regulators who have brought cases against [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=248.74s)]
*  not only Google, but Amazon and Apple and Meta, the owner of Facebook as well. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=252.70000000000002s)]
*  And we'll be looking to see whether or not this ruling emboldens the regulators to continue [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=257.74s)]
*  to be aggressive against these tech giants. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  In Iraq, at least five people, including U.S. troops and contractors, were injured after [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=271.62s)]
*  a rocket attack on an air base last night. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=276.70000000000005s)]
*  The region has been on high alert for days after Iran said it would retaliate for last [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=279.70000000000005s)]
*  week's killings of a Hamas leader in Tehran and a Hezbollah leader in Beirut. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=284.62s)]
*  It's unclear if this attack on the base is part of that response. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=289.82000000000005s)]
*  Iran-backed groups have been targeting American forces in Iraq for months in an attempt to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=294.1s)]
*  force them out of the country. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=298.98s)]
*  No one has taken responsibility for the strike. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=301.26000000000005s)]
*  And finally, in Paris, the women's boxing matches have erupted in controversy as people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=306.66s)]
*  questioned the gender of two women in the competition, Iman Khalif of Algeria and Lin [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=316.94s)]
*  Yuting of Taiwan. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=322.26000000000005s)]
*  In a murky and controversial decision, they were both disqualified from last year's Women's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=324.42s)]
*  Boxing World Championships. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=329.5s)]
*  The International Boxing Agency claimed they failed an unspecified test and were found [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=331.9s)]
*  to have, quote, competitive advantages over female competitors. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=336.94s)]
*  The IAB promised more clarity about the test, then told reporters it couldn't release more [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=341.73999999999995s)]
*  details. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=346.78s)]
*  The Olympic Committee has objected to their process and no longer recognizes the agency's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=348.14s)]
*  authority. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=352.82s)]
*  This year, to try and combat the flurry of misinformation, Olympic officials have repeatedly [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=354.26s)]
*  said Khalif and Lin meet every benchmark to fight in the women's divisions. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=359.92s)]
*  They rely on passports and medical clearances to determine eligibility. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=364.76s)]
*  An Olympic spokesman said that neither athlete is transgender. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=369.2s)]
*  But the questions and accusations have continued. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  One of Khalif's opponents, Angela Carini of Italy, abandoned an Olympic match last week [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=376.72s)]
*  after taking a hard punch from Khalif. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=382.12s)]
*  And Italy's prime minister called it a match that did not seem on equal footing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=384.72s)]
*  Carini herself, meanwhile, said she does not object to Khalif fighting and even said she [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=390.72s)]
*  hopes Khalif wins gold. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  Khalif will fight again today in the semifinals. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=397.72s)]
*  The chief spokesman for the Olympic Committee acknowledged there's a lack of consensus about [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=400.88000000000005s)]
*  how to resolve eligibility issues across women's sports, calling the topic, quote, a minefield. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=405.88000000000005s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=415.72s)]
*  Today on The Daily, more about what the market panic could mean for the U.S. economy going [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=417.84000000000003s)]
*  forward. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=423.12s)]
*  You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=424.12s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRGG8vB3jE8&t=429.40000000000003s)]
