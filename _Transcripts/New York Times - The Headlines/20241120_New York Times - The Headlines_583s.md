# Former W.W.E. Boss Tapped to Run Education, and Trans Rights on Capitol Hill
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, November 20th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=8.36s)]
*  Donald Trump has made another unconventional pick for his cabinet, choosing Linda McMahon, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=13.68s)]
*  who has almost no background in education, for secretary of education. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=19.56s)]
*  McMahon is a former wrestling executive who led WWE. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=24.72s)]
*  He's also a close personal friend of Trump's, who served during his first term, running [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=29.44s)]
*  the Small Business Administration. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  Trump has repeatedly talked about getting rid of the Department of Education altogether, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  but that would require congressional action. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=41.78s)]
*  Instead, Times reporter Erica Green says that McMahon, if she's confirmed, will likely upend [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  the department from the inside, at Trump's request. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=50.040000000000006s)]
*  Like many conservatives, President-elect Donald Trump believes that the Department of Education [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=53.24s)]
*  has inserted itself into issues that it shouldn't be a part of, such as race, gender, that it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  delivers edicts on what students should be taught and how, and ultimately has taken power [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=67.16s)]
*  away from parents. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=73.72s)]
*  Erica says there are some clues about where McMahon might focus first. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=75.68s)]
*  She's the chair of a right-wing think tank that's called for a drastic overhaul of education [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=80.44s)]
*  policy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=85.0s)]
*  That includes stopping schools from promoting, quote, unpatriotic concepts about institutionalized [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=86.46s)]
*  racism, and expanding voucher programs that would direct more public funds to homeschooling [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  or private or religious schools. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  All of this is expected to happen when schools are combating a series of crises. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=101.61999999999999s)]
*  Student test scores are among the lowest they've ever been. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=108.89999999999999s)]
*  Colleges are facing enrollment crises, and both K-12 and college campuses are struggling [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=112.7s)]
*  to climb back to the levels of performance that they were at before the pandemic. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=121.14s)]
*  And as the nation's schools and colleges have struggled to recover from a lot of the damage [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=127.28s)]
*  they have experienced in recent years, education advocates fear that Trump's plans for the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=134.4s)]
*  department could set them back even further. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=140.78s)]
*  Also yesterday, Trump continued his trend of selecting television personalities to lead [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=148.06s)]
*  federal agencies. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=153.46s)]
*  He said he plans to nominate Dr. Mehmet Oz, best known as TV's Dr. Oz, to run the Centers [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=155.22s)]
*  for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees health insurance programs for more [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=161.24s)]
*  than 150 million Americans. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=166.18s)]
*  And Trump tapped the Wall Street executive Howard Lutnick to be Commerce Secretary. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=170.02s)]
*  It's increasingly one of the most powerful economic positions in the government. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=175.3s)]
*  The primary responsibility is advocating for U.S. business interests overseas, which could [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=179.5s)]
*  put Lutnick at the center of discussions on tariffs and trade wars. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=185.1s)]
*  In Congress, the fight over transgender rights has taken a personal turn. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=197.62s)]
*  This week, Republican Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina said she plans to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=203.38s)]
*  call for a ban on transgender women using women's restrooms on Capitol Hill. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=208.1s)]
*  Is this effort in response to Congresswoman McBride coming to Congress? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  Yes, and absolutely, and then some. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=217.26s)]
*  I'm not going to stand. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=219.22s)]
*  Mace has been explicit that she's specifically targeting Sarah McBride, a newly elected [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  Democratic representative from Delaware who's the first openly trans member of Congress. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=225.78s)]
*  House Republicans have spent the last few years routinely proposing national anti-trans [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=231.7s)]
*  legislation and now some are signaling they'll support this measure in their own workplace. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=236.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, Democrats on the Hill reacted to the proposal with outrage, calling it disgusting [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=241.5s)]
*  and cruel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=246.86s)]
*  For the moment, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has been noncommittal about how far [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  the measure will get. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=252.86s)]
*  A man is a man and a woman is a woman, and a man cannot become a woman. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=254.02s)]
*  But I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity, and so we can do and believe [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=260.62s)]
*  all those things at the same time. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=265.42s)]
*  And I wanted to make that clear for everybody because there's lots of questions. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=267.5s)]
*  In a statement, McBride herself wrote, quote, everyday Americans go to work with people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=279.74s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a reward yesterday, $5 million to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=283.86s)]
*  anyone who returns one of the hostages still being held in Gaza. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=301.46000000000004s)]
*  The hostages were taken over a year ago during Hamas's attack on Israel. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  About 100 are still being held, though several dozen of them are believed to be dead. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=310.74s)]
*  Many Israelis, including the hostages' families, have accused Netanyahu of not prioritizing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  the hostages' release. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=321.46000000000004s)]
*  They say he's resisted making a ceasefire deal to free them and instead prolonged the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  war for his own political gain. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=328.22s)]
*  The prime minister made the reward announcement while in the Gaza Strip, where he was visiting [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=330.88s)]
*  Israeli troops. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=335.54s)]
*  He said that anyone who returns a hostage will also receive safe passage out of Gaza [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=337.3s)]
*  for themselves and their family. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=342.32s)]
*  So this week started with a Monday that was, by some counts, the absolute worst air pollution [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=352.02000000000004s)]
*  there's been over Delhi for about eight years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=359.02s)]
*  It felt like we got bombed with pea soup kind of fog or smog over the whole city. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=362.62s)]
*  You could not see the sun in the middle of the day, and most of us can feel it also in [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=369.1s)]
*  your lungs, in your eyes. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=374.18s)]
*  Maybe you got headachy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=376.22s)]
*  Maybe you get tired. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=377.46s)]
*  My colleague Alex Trevely is a correspondent based in India's capital, New Delhi, where [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=378.94s)]
*  the air quality index soared to more than 1,700 this week. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=383.9s)]
*  Anything above 300 is considered hazardous. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=388.82s)]
*  He says that while this particular stretch has been brutal, the city is caught in a cycle [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=392.26s)]
*  where thick smothering air pollution settles on Delhi every November. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=397.9s)]
*  As the temperature drops on this part of the Indian plains, backed up against the Himalaya [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=402.34s)]
*  mountain range, it becomes impossible for air to refresh itself. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=406.64s)]
*  Wind patterns change, and all of the ordinary pollutants hangs over us in a great choking [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=412.32s)]
*  haze. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  There are a lot of contributing factors. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  There's vehicle pollution. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=422.22s)]
*  There's fields that have been cleared for harvest. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=424.06s)]
*  Farmers burned down the stubble around this time of year to clear it for the next crop. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=426.66s)]
*  There are firecrackers on Diwali. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=431.26000000000005s)]
*  Depending on where you stand in society, you might have a very different experience of [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=433.94000000000005s)]
*  this kind of pollution. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=437.94000000000005s)]
*  What you might call upper middle class or wealthy households, many now have air purifiers. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=439.46000000000004s)]
*  But that's proportionally a really tiny part of the population. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=444.74s)]
*  Most people are left to fend for themselves. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  You see a lot of people tying big pieces of fabric up around their face, or maybe they [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=451.70000000000005s)]
*  have some N95 type masks left over from the pandemic. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=455.74s)]
*  But it's got so bad that this one very prominent member of parliament wrote, perhaps mockingly, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=460.1s)]
*  that if the air is unbreathable, if the city is unlivable from November to January each [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=467.46000000000004s)]
*  year, should it even be the capital? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=472.06s)]
*  Should India's capital be moved to some other place? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=474.48s)]
*  And finally. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=481.66s)]
*  Do you hear the people sing a song of angry men? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=482.66s)]
*  Les Mis is one of the most famous musicals in the world. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=493.66s)]
*  It's been performed in 22 languages and seen by over a hundred million people. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=496.74s)]
*  But ironically, the tale of uprising and rebellion has never been a hit in France, despite being [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=502.66s)]
*  set in France, adapted from a French novel, and having two Frenchmen as the show's creators. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=508.54s)]
*  It's only been performed in Paris twice since it debuted in the 1980s, which means more [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=514.62s)]
*  musical theater kids in Kansas probably know the words than anyone in France. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=519.22s)]
*  Some of it's because musicals in general were just not popular in the country for a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=524.02s)]
*  while. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=527.74s)]
*  Critics didn't love it either. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=529.02s)]
*  One French journalist called the show deplorably foolish and vulgar. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=530.54s)]
*  Even the film adaptation with Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway didn't win over French [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=535.24s)]
*  audiences. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=539.26s)]
*  But a new stage production opening today in Paris thinks it can change that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=540.86s)]
*  The producers have reworked the lyrics, modernized the production, and have a more diverse cast. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=545.72s)]
*  And this time, France appears to be ready to embrace its musical offspring. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  The initial run is nearly sold out. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=555.86s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=562.5s)]
*  Stay on the daily. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__Mp42GOpTo&t=563.92s)]
