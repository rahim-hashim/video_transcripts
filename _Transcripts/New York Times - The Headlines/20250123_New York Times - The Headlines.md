# How Republicans Will Try to Pay for Trump’s Agenda, and a New A.D.H.D. Study
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Thursday, January 23rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=8.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's dramatic steps to reshape the US government are causing upheaval at [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=14.56s)]
*  multiple federal agencies. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=19.96s)]
*  At the Department of Health and Human Services, a memo went out temporarily prohibiting the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=22.72s)]
*  release of any public communication unless it's reviewed by a Trump administration appointee [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=27.48s)]
*  first. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=32.76s)]
*  That includes any new health guidance or notices from agencies like the Centers for Disease [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=34.36s)]
*  Control or the Food and Drug Administration. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=39.18s)]
*  They are essentially muted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=42.32s)]
*  Over at the National Security Council, which is tasked with dealing with crises around [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=44.74s)]
*  the world, the staff were told yesterday to pack up, go home, and wait to see if they'd [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=48.56s)]
*  be invited to apply to get their positions back. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=53.64s)]
*  Trump's national security adviser said anyone who is brought back will be, quote, fully [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=57.2s)]
*  aligned with Trump's America First agenda. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  And at the State Department, which Trump has called the Deep State Department, insinuating [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=65.36s)]
*  that's full of people working against him, dozens of senior officials have cleared out [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  faster than usual, and many don't have replacements yet. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  Trump has also put his stamp on the hiring process for new federal employees. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=79.2s)]
*  Yesterday, he revoked a longstanding policy banning discrimination in government hiring. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=83.92s)]
*  President Lyndon Johnson put it in place back in the 1960s during the civil rights movement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  Trump has said he wants to return to what he calls a merit-based and colorblind system. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=95.30000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Republicans have been meeting to try and figure out how to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  pay for President Trump's ambitious agenda. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  The immigration crackdown and tax cuts that he's promised voters are enormously expensive. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=110.24s)]
*  Even just extending the tax cuts he pushed during his first term would cost the government [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=116.0s)]
*  $5 trillion. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  So lawmakers are passing around a 50-page list of potential options that basically has [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=122.88s)]
*  everything they can think of to offset Trump's sweeping proposals. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=128.32s)]
*  They could tax people who get perks at work, like free gym memberships. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  That could raise about $20 billion. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=136.98s)]
*  They could tax all college scholarships and fellowships to generate $54 billion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=139.54s)]
*  Or they could put in place a work requirement for Medicaid recipients. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=145.34s)]
*  That would cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose coverage and save the government [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  about $100 billion. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=153.5s)]
*  The list is a political minefield, and narrowing it down will be a challenge. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  Many of their proposals would hurt low-income Americans to help pay in part for tax cuts [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=162.1s)]
*  which largely benefit the wealthy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=167.18s)]
*  And there's a group of hardline Republican lawmakers who say they won't support any [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=169.68s)]
*  new proposals that would add to the national debt. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=173.96s)]
*  Still, Republican leaders are hoping to come to a consensus around one major bill that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=177.2s)]
*  will bundle Trump's priorities along with the measures needed to pay for them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=182.28s)]
*  They would then likely use a process called reconciliation to push it through Congress [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=186.9s)]
*  without needing any Democratic support. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=191.12s)]
*  My colleagues and I spoke to people in the West Bank this week who said just after the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=197.1s)]
*  ceasefire came into effect in the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces were moving in large numbers [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=206.1s)]
*  into the northern West Bank. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=212.76s)]
*  My colleague Adam Raskan has been covering the new military operation Israel's now carrying [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=214.66s)]
*  out in the occupied West Bank. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=218.85999999999999s)]
*  Nearly 3 million Palestinians live in the territory, along with half a million Jewish [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  settlers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=225.66s)]
*  Israel's turned its attention specifically to the city of Jenin, which it raided a dozen [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=226.82s)]
*  times in the last year. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=231.42s)]
*  Palestinian Health Ministry says 10 people have been killed so far. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=233.26s)]
*  The city of Jenin has long been a bastion of militancy, but over the past four years, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=236.9s)]
*  the number of militants and sophistication has grown. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=242.66s)]
*  Members of Islamic Jihad and Hamas and other groups have taken up arms. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=247.22s)]
*  They say they're fighting Israel's occupation, but Israel says these people are terrorists [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=254.06s)]
*  and carried out a number of attacks against both Israeli soldiers and civilians. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=260.46s)]
*  Every time there's a major operation by the Israelis, there's enormous impact for civilians. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=268.62s)]
*  And in the past, when the Israeli military has raided Jenin, they've left behind a trail [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=276.18s)]
*  of destruction, damaging roads, ripping up water lines in sewage systems in what it says [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=281.42s)]
*  is an effort to neutralize improvised explosive devices. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=288.66s)]
*  The mood in Jenin is very tense. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=295.66s)]
*  People are wondering how long this operation will last. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=297.62s)]
*  It's upended thousands of residents' lives. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  Many are unable to reach their homes, and they're wondering whether these raids will [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=306.26s)]
*  expand to other parts of the West Bank and grow in intensity and scale. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=311.62s)]
*  There's a new study out today that looks at life expectancy for adults with ADHD. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=326.38s)]
*  The findings, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, show that people with attention [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=332.38s)]
*  deficit hyperactivity disorder have significantly shorter lifespans than people without it, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=336.82s)]
*  around seven years shorter for men, nine years shorter for women. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=342.86s)]
*  The study doesn't identify exactly why that's happening, but the researchers said adults [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=347.38s)]
*  with ADHD find it harder to manage their impulses, and they engage in more risky behaviors. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=352.18s)]
*  The data showed they were nearly twice as likely to smoke or abuse alcohol, and they [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=358.62s)]
*  have far higher rates of self-harming and suicidal tendencies. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=362.86s)]
*  For a long time, much of the conversation about ADHD has centered around kids instead [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=367.22s)]
*  of adults, and often about whether they can focus in school. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=372.5s)]
*  One ADHD researcher said it's now clear it should not be thought of as a childhood issue, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=376.82s)]
*  but instead as a lifelong disorder. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=382.1s)]
*  And finally. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=388.62s)]
*  This was almost perfect. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=392.66s)]
*  I'm tearing up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=393.86s)]
*  That frontside 1080 with the tail grab. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=395.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=397.98s)]
*  The Winter X Games start later today in Colorado. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=399.02s)]
*  She's just got to hang on. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=402.74s)]
*  Frontside 900. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=403.74s)]
*  The twist. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=404.74s)]
*  Back to bat. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=405.74s)]
*  So wet. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=406.74s)]
*  Tens crate. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=407.74s)]
*  Athletes are strapping on their snowboards at the top of the giant half pipes, and judges [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=410.62s)]
*  are getting ready to figure out who pulled off a 1620 twist and who only got to a measly [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=415.22s)]
*  1400. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=420.54s)]
*  But now, for the first time, organizers are testing out what they call a potential superpower [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=421.54s)]
*  for those judges. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  An AI system that will kick out its own ratings for the snowboarders. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=428.42s)]
*  The idea is that a system of cameras and computers can track the athletes as they spin, flip, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  and fly through the air better than the human eye can. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=437.90000000000003s)]
*  So for now, again, it's just a test, and humans still have the final say. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=441.22s)]
*  The head of the X Games said the appeal of the technology is pretty simple. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=446.14000000000004s)]
*  Quote, sometimes humans make mistakes. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=449.98s)]
*  It's part of a larger digital shift in sports. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=453.1s)]
*  Electronic systems now watch out for ins and outs in tennis. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=456.5s)]
*  Cameras look for offsides in soccer. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=460.3s)]
*  And officials in gymnastics have already been using AI to review judges' scores. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  How far and how fast this technology will spread is still up in the air. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=467.76s)]
*  But people who love to argue with the ref or the umpire might eventually find themselves [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  screaming, are you blind? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  At a computer instead. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=478.24s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at President Trump's plan to turn away from clean energy and double [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=486.52s)]
*  down on oil. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=492.36s)]
*  What's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=494.16s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl7FBOvgSWU&t=498.6s)]
