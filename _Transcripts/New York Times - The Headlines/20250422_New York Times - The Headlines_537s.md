# How to Choose a Pope, and a Deportation ‘Black Hole’
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, April 22nd. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=8.0s)]
*  From Vatican City to the Philippines to the Democratic Republic of Congo, mourners have [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=16.44s)]
*  turned out to honor Pope Francis, who died yesterday at 88. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=25.78s)]
*  The Vatican announced yesterday that his cause of death was a stroke, and officials have [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=33.260000000000005s)]
*  now begun the preparations for the funeral of the Catholic leader. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=37.22s)]
*  Francis was known for rejecting some of the pageantry that came with being pope, preferring [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=41.18s)]
*  a more modest lifestyle. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=46.1s)]
*  He lived in a Vatican apartment instead of the usual palace and ate his meals at a cafeteria. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=48.02s)]
*  Even before his death, he rewrote some of the rules around papal funerals to make them [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=53.42s)]
*  less of an elaborate spectacle. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=58.260000000000005s)]
*  For example, his body will not be put on a raised pedestal, but laid in a simple coffin. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=60.84s)]
*  On Saturday morning, world leaders are expected to gather at the Vatican for a public mass [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=66.86s)]
*  to mark Francis's death. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=71.3s)]
*  Once the funeral is complete, the church's leadership will turn to selecting the next [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=73.62s)]
*  pope, a centuries-old highly ritualized process. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=77.94s)]
*  Over a hundred cardinals from around the world will travel to the Vatican and convene in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=83.7s)]
*  the Sistine Chapel for what's known as a conclave. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=88.34s)]
*  They'll swear an oath of secrecy and vote using private ballots to choose Francis's successor. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=92.02s)]
*  Any candidate must win a two-thirds majority to be elected, so it often takes multiple [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=99.38s)]
*  votes over multiple days as different factions try to push their vision for the future of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=104.62s)]
*  the church. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=110.06s)]
*  After each round, the ballots are burned and colored smoke is released from the Vatican's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=111.54s)]
*  chimney as a signal. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=116.34s)]
*  If the smoke is black, they haven't reached a consensus. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  When the smoke is white, a new pope has been chosen. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=121.86000000000001s)]
*  For more on the legacy of Pope Francis, listen to today's episode of The Daily. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  Now, three updates on the Trump administration. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=134.66s)]
*  Donald Trump delivering another brutal day to Wall Street. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=138.14s)]
*  Stocks, bonds, and the value of the U.S. dollar all tumbled yesterday after President Trump [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=141.38s)]
*  renewed his attacks on the chair of the Federal Reserve. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  He called Jerome Powell a, quote, major loser and urged the Fed to lower interest rates. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=151.05999999999997s)]
*  Trump has been pushing for the lower rates as a way to boost the economy amid his disruptive [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  new tariffs. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=162.61999999999998s)]
*  But for many investors, even a hint that the president may be trying to undermine the Fed's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=163.94s)]
*  independence set off alarm bells. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=169.02s)]
*  Also, Harvard has taken its fight against the Trump administration to the courts, filing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=172.1s)]
*  a lawsuit yesterday accusing the administration of trying to exert unprecedented and improper [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=177.74s)]
*  control over the university. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=183.34s)]
*  The administration has moved to freeze billions of dollars in federal funding for the school [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  after Harvard rejected a series of demands to give the government more oversight over [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=190.06s)]
*  its hiring and academic programs. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=194.98s)]
*  And. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=198.9s)]
*  President Trump is standing behind his secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, after news broke [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=203.9s)]
*  that Hegseth shared military attack plans in a group chat with his family members. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=208.74s)]
*  Trump called any concerns about how Hegseth handled the sensitive national security information [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=213.78s)]
*  a waste of time. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=218.9s)]
*  But the Times has learned that inside the Pentagon, there are also wider concerns about [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=220.74s)]
*  how the department is functioning under Hegseth, with current and former officials describing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=225.58s)]
*  widespread disarray. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=230.62s)]
*  There have been screaming matches between Hegseth's aides. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=232.5s)]
*  His team has been combing through staff members' old social media posts to look for signs of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=235.66s)]
*  disloyalty. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=240.78s)]
*  And bureaucratic log jams have slowed down key defense projects like a new missile defense [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  system for the U.S. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=247.02s)]
*  A Pentagon spokesman blamed any reports about dysfunction there on disgruntled employees [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=248.86s)]
*  with an axe to grind. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  As the federal government ramps up its efforts to deport migrants, the Times has been tracking [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=263.62s)]
*  some of their cases, and a new investigation has found that one man has essentially disappeared. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=268.58s)]
*  Ricardo Pradovasquez, who's 32 and originally from Venezuela, was working in Detroit this [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=274.98s)]
*  January when he made a wrong turn. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=280.3s)]
*  He was trying to deliver a McDonald's order and accidentally got onto the bridge that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=283.18s)]
*  connects Michigan to Canada, a common mistake even for people who live in the city. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=287.26s)]
*  At the border, U.S. authorities took him into custody, and the Times has reviewed records [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  that show he was held for over a month before a deportation order came down. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=297.02000000000004s)]
*  On March 15th, while being held at a detention facility in Texas, he told a friend he expected [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=302.24s)]
*  to be sent back to Venezuela, but no one has seen or heard from him since. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  That night, the federal government sent over 200 migrants to a high-security prison in [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=313.12s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=317.52s)]
*  His friends and family thought maybe he was one of them, but his name is not on that list. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=319.0s)]
*  Venezuelan authorities haven't found any information about him either, according to his family. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=324.2s)]
*  And when a lawyer tried to track him down, ICE officials eventually confirmed he was [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=329.18s)]
*  deported but refused to say where. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=333.5s)]
*  The confusion may be administrative oversight, but immigrant advocates and legal scholars [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=336.72s)]
*  say the case suggests a new level of disorder in the immigration system. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=341.66s)]
*  One expert told the Times he hadn't heard of a disappearance like this in the 40 years [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  he'd been teaching and practicing immigration law. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=351.62s)]
*  He said, quote, this case represents a black hole. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=354.66s)]
*  Today at the Supreme Court, a set of kids books will be at the center of the arguments. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=359.18s)]
*  A few years ago, Maryland's largest public school system added a handful of books to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=372.6s)]
*  their elementary school curriculum that included LGBTQ characters. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=377.18s)]
*  There's one book about a girl with a crush on another girl and one about a transgender [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=381.9s)]
*  boy who wins a karate tournament. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=385.86s)]
*  Initially, the school system gave parents notice when the books were going to be discussed [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=388.42s)]
*  and the option to have their children sit those sessions out. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=392.82s)]
*  But they then eliminated those policies, saying they led to students missing class and that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=396.34000000000003s)]
*  they might cause kids who saw themselves or their families represented in the books to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=401.58s)]
*  feel stigmatized. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  Some parents sued, saying the books violate their rights to freedom of religion. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=408.06s)]
*  They say they don't want the books removed, but they want to shield their children from [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=412.98s)]
*  having to discuss them. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=416.36s)]
*  To date, lower courts have ruled against the parents, with one judge writing, quote, simply [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=418.44s)]
*  hearing about other views does not necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differently [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=424.2s)]
*  than one's religious faith requires. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=429.56s)]
*  But the case is now in front of the Supreme Court, which in recent years has increasingly [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=432.48s)]
*  ruled in favor of religious rights. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=436.86s)]
*  For example, the court sided with a web designer who did not want to create sites for same-sex [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=439.64s)]
*  weddings and with a high school football coach who said he had a constitutional right [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=444.04s)]
*  to prey on the 50-yard line at his team's games. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=448.76000000000005s)]
*  A decision in this case isn't expected until around June at the end of the court's term. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=452.40000000000003s)]
*  And finally, the Oscars are waiting into what's been a brewing controversy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  Can a movie that relies on artificial intelligence win an award or should those be saved for, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=467.52000000000004s)]
*  you know, humans? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=473.36s)]
*  Yesterday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences updated its rules to say that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=474.36s)]
*  using AI will not disqualify a movie from the competition, but that the Academy will [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=479.84s)]
*  take into account how much a human was behind the creative expression. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  The issue bubbled up at this year's Oscars when Adrian Brody was nominated for his performance [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=490.56s)]
*  in The Brutalist, in which he plays a Hungarian immigrant. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=495.4s)]
*  It came out that the film used AI to enhance the accents on some of the dialogue in Hungarian. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=498.92s)]
*  Brody went on to win. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  Other nominated films like Amelia Perez and Dune Part II also used AI tools. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=507.2s)]
*  The Academy had been considering requiring movies to disclose if they used AI, but didn't [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  go that far yet. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=518.24s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=525.12s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=526.12s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5O_jrDcgWQ&t=527.12s)]
