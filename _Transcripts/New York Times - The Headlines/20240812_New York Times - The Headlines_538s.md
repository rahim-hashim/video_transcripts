# Hacking Hits the 2024 Race, and a Pivotal Week for Gaza
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, August [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=0.0s)]
*  12th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=7.32s)]
*  Hacking has hit the 2024 presidential race. And this year, it's not Russia, but Iran [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=14.72s)]
*  making the first significant move. Microsoft released a report saying a group run by Iran's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps has hacked into the account of a former senior advisor to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=26.5s)]
*  a presidential campaign. It said the group then used its access to send phishing messages [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=31.22s)]
*  to try and get into the campaign's accounts and databases. Microsoft didn't identify [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=36.980000000000004s)]
*  the target, but Donald Trump declared this weekend that it was his campaign. It's unclear [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=42.04s)]
*  what, if anything, the Iranian group was able to achieve. But investigators say there's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=47.54s)]
*  little doubt Iran wants Trump to lose. When he was president, he withdrew the U.S. from [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=53.22s)]
*  a landmark nuclear deal, reimposed sanctions, and ordered the killing of a top commander [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=58.58s)]
*  of the Revolutionary Guard. Ahead of the 2016 election, Russian hackers broke into the email [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=64.34s)]
*  accounts of top Democratic officials and leaked troves of communications. But this year, cybersecurity [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=72.06s)]
*  experts say Russia has been hanging back, instead trying to interfere with the Olympics [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=79.1s)]
*  and undermine support for Ukraine. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=84.5s)]
*  As the 2024 campaign continues, new polls from the Times and Siena College show that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=92.1s)]
*  Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in three crucial battleground states. Harris is ahead [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=97.74s)]
*  in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan by four percentage points. It's a dramatic [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=103.9s)]
*  reversal for the Democrats. When President Biden was the candidate, he was either trailing [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  or tied with Trump in those states. Still, the results show some vulnerabilities for [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=114.82000000000001s)]
*  Harris. More voters say Trump has a clear vision for the country than she does, and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=120.34s)]
*  more trust him to handle the economy and immigration, issues that remain central to the race. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=126.5s)]
*  The Israeli military has ordered civilians to evacuate from part of the humanitarian [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=133.9s)]
*  zone that it set up in southern Gaza, saying it's planning to target, quote, embedded [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  terrorist infrastructure there. It's the latest time Israel has shrunk the boundaries of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=151.26s)]
*  the humanitarian zone, and many civilians in Gaza say there's nowhere left that's safe [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=156.74s)]
*  for them to go. On Saturday, Israel struck a school being used as a shelter, saying Hamas [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=161.7s)]
*  fighters were running a command center there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=167.82s)]
*  The local Gaza health authorities put the death toll at around 100. Israel's disputing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=170.42s)]
*  that and saying that it used very precise munitions and that it knows of 19 militants [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=176.22s)]
*  who were eliminated there. This is the kind of thing that is still happening. Israel is [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=182.22s)]
*  still, you know, continuing with the campaign. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=187.1s)]
*  Isabelle Kirchner covers the war in Gaza for the Times. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=191.02s)]
*  They said over the weekend they'd struck about 30 Hamas targets all over the Strip. And [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=194.18s)]
*  the military and the political leaders are all saying that actually keeping up the military [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=200.3s)]
*  pressure on Hamas in Gaza is the way to create conditions for a ceasefire. So that is not [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=206.58s)]
*  letting up. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=215.66s)]
*  While talks are supposed to resume this week, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have demanded that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=217.46s)]
*  negotiators meet on Thursday to work toward a final proposal. Israel has said it will [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=222.46s)]
*  be there. It's unclear if Hamas will participate. Meanwhile, Isabelle says Israel is still braced [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=227.5s)]
*  for major attacks on its own territory after Iran vowed to retaliate for the back-to-back [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=233.82s)]
*  assassinations of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah two weeks ago. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  There's just this great uncertainty. Everybody's on standby. People are not really in a major [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=243.34s)]
*  panic, but certainly aware. I think most people by now have probably stocked up with bottled [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=250.46s)]
*  water. We don't know if the electricity could go out. You know, we've been told to store [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=257.94s)]
*  days and generally to go about routine, but at the same time, be aware that the situation [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=266.62s)]
*  could change very, very quickly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=274.3s)]
*  More than 70,000 on hand to celebrate these 2024 games. After 19 days of competition, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=280.98s)]
*  time to close it out in style. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=292.74s)]
*  In Paris last night, the Olympics came to a close. The U.S. is going home with the biggest [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=294.38s)]
*  haul of medals, 126. China came in second with 91 medals, while Britain and France nearly [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=300.21999999999997s)]
*  tied for third. The closing ceremonies were one last chance for Paris to show off with [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=307.42s)]
*  acrobats, a floating piano and fireworks. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=313.86s)]
*  It feels so sad to have the flame go out, but Paris will shine so brightly after this [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=316.86s)]
*  immense competition. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=323.22s)]
*  France is feeling proud, very happy, ecstatic really. It's been really striking to me as [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=326.18s)]
*  someone living in France how the euphoria of the games has bled into optimism for the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  future there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=339.94000000000005s)]
*  Times International correspondent Catherine Porter has been covering the Paris games, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=341.66s)]
*  which cost almost $5 billion to pull off. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=346.14s)]
*  So historically, many of the Olympic games have been synonymous with white elephants, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=350.06s)]
*  big buildings that don't necessarily get used well afterwards, and bloated over spending. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=355.3s)]
*  But from the beginning, I will say the organizers promised that was not the case. They said [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=361.7s)]
*  there would be a legacy and this would be a success, not just for the world and the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=366.86s)]
*  athletes, but for Parisians. They promised to clean the river Seine, and so far they've [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=370.46s)]
*  done that. They promised to be the greenest games of all time, to cut emissions by half [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=375.5s)]
*  and make the way of getting to the events public transport mostly and bikes. And they [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=381.02s)]
*  laid down a ton of bike paths, opened a new subway. So they did that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=386.82s)]
*  They promised to build almost nothing except for in Saint-San-Denis, which is a sprawling [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=391.41999999999996s)]
*  suburb of Paris made up of about 40 different cities. It is the poorest or among the poorest, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=396.9s)]
*  the most heavily populated by new immigrants, the youngest and the most overlooked generally. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=404.46s)]
*  And yet there is where they built the Aquatic Center. They built many new bridges and going [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  around that region now, speaking to people there, many people I spoke to were not just [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=417.82s)]
*  enjoying the games, but saw that there would be a legacy for them. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=422.65999999999997s)]
*  I was amazed at how many said that they finally felt part of France. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  As the Olympics in Paris wrapped up, the spotlight immediately turned to the next host of the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=432.1s)]
*  summer games, Los Angeles. In an over the top, straight out of Hollywood and very American [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=441.22s)]
*  stunt, Tom Cruise repelled into the stadium to pick up the Olympic flag before racing [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=448.98s)]
*  away on a motorcycle, full Mission Impossible style. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=454.18s)]
*  The journey to America begins. Let's go. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=457.74s)]
*  But the clock is already ticking for LA, in particular for its audacious plan to make [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=462.74s)]
*  the Olympics there car free. Yes, that was LA and car free in the same sentence. City [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  officials are planning to expand the city subway, borrow almost 3000 buses and clear [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=475.26s)]
*  whole freeway lanes to make room for public transit. But a lot of the work hasn't even [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=481.46000000000004s)]
*  started yet and traffic's gone up in recent years. Still, LA has a few high profile chances [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=486.62s)]
*  to test its transit systems before the torch arrives. It's hosting some of the World Cup [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=494.1s)]
*  matches in 2026 and the Super Bowl in 2027. That means there is plenty of time for someone [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  to help Tom Cruise find his bus stop. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=506.38s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, Times reporter Jonathan Swan on how Kamala [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=512.38s)]
*  Harris entering the race has thrown Donald Trump's campaign into disarray. You can listen [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=518.02s)]
*  on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=523.7s)]
*  back tomorrow. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ein4BMqpZc&t=528.86s)]
