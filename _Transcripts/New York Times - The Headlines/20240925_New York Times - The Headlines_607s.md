# Hezbollah Fires Toward Tel Aviv, and Iran’s New President Addresses U.N.
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=4.96s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, September 25th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=6.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=8.68s)]
*  Early this morning in Tel Aviv, the Israeli military says it intercepted a missile fired [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=19.12s)]
*  by Hezbollah that appeared to be the militant group's deepest attack yet into the country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=23.56s)]
*  The missile triggered alerts and air raid sirens and sent residents fleeing for shelters. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=29.04s)]
*  Hezbollah said it was targeting the headquarters of Israel's foreign intelligence service in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=34.32s)]
*  retaliation for assassinations of some of its leaders in the past week, along with the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=38.92s)]
*  deadly explosions of hundreds of pagers and walkie talkies. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=43.46s)]
*  The Times has learned that this recent surge in violence was kicked off almost by chance. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=47.64s)]
*  Five current and former top Israeli officials say that Israel had gotten last-minute intel [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=53.0s)]
*  that its plan to blow up Hezbollah pagers was about to be exposed, so they rushed forward [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  with the operation, kicking off a week of attacks and counterattacks that are still ongoing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=63.0s)]
*  On the one hand, Israel's attacks have been, in military terms, a tactical success. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=68.6s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley is the Times' Jerusalem bureau chief. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=73.8s)]
*  They have managed to infiltrate and destroy part of Hezbollah's communication networks. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=76.88s)]
*  They have taken out several key commanders, and they say they have destroyed military [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=83.64s)]
*  targets, rocket launchers, weapons, caches all across Hezbollah's heartland in southern [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=89.64s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=95.52s)]
*  The flip side is that Israel appears no closer to achieving its strategic goals. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  The goal is to get Hezbollah to retreat from the border and make it safe for the roughly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=104.6s)]
*  60,000 Israelis who have been displaced from their homes since last October to return to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=109.92s)]
*  those homes. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=116.0s)]
*  Hezbollah is still firing into northern Israel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=117.64s)]
*  They appear to be escalating in response to Israel's escalation, and a week into this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=120.92s)]
*  raising of the stakes, it doesn't appear that Israel's gamble has yet paid off. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=128.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, a new analysis by the Times shows that Israeli raids in the West Bank last month [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=133.84s)]
*  caused widespread destruction. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=143.72s)]
*  Israel said their operations in the towns of Tulkarm and Jenin were part of a counterterrorism [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=146.36s)]
*  effort to root out Hamas and other militants in the occupied territory. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=151.08s)]
*  Video verified by the Times showed Israeli troops bulldozing infrastructure, destroying [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=157.6s)]
*  businesses and getting in the way of ambulances and emergency responders. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=161.84s)]
*  Israel's conducted raids against militants in the West Bank for decades, but in the past [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=166.68s)]
*  few weeks, residents say that the destruction those raids have caused has been like nothing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=170.6s)]
*  else they've ever seen. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=174.32s)]
*  Erica Solomon is part of the team of Times reporters who looked through visual evidence [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=176.0s)]
*  of the Israeli raids. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=180.34s)]
*  When you look at the videos that we've examined, it looks like a war zone. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  The streets have been completely ripped up. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=186.22s)]
*  It's all dirt. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=188.38s)]
*  It's cratered. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  They plowed through soccer fields that kids play on, all kinds of places. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=190.88s)]
*  Locals don't make sense as a target for military operations. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=196.88s)]
*  In a lot of cases, after these Israeli bulldozers have gone through, people are left without [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=200.76s)]
*  any running water, with their sewage spilling into the streets, without any electricity. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=207.56s)]
*  What people would describe as like years of a family business, decades sometimes, that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=212.92s)]
*  they had built up being detonated in an explosion, a bulldozer ramming through their jewelry [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=217.16s)]
*  shop, destroying their entire collection of jewelry. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=223.16s)]
*  I spoke to a man who works in a square that has now been raided, I think, 18 times this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=227.48s)]
*  year. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=232.96s)]
*  And the feeling that people had, it was often such despair. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=234.16s)]
*  Even before the latest raids, Jenin and Turkatam were seen as places where militancy could [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=241.88s)]
*  thrive because of a lack of economic opportunity. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  And what some business owners that we spoke to said was that now, with all of this destruction, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=249.88s)]
*  that trend could be exacerbated, that more people could actually turn to militant groups. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=254.83999999999997s)]
*  The Times sent the Israeli military a detailed list asking about the extent of the destruction. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=261.8s)]
*  It acknowledged that there was, quote, unavoidable harm to civilian structures and said it was [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  necessary in order to look for mines and destroy weapons stockpiles. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=272.64s)]
*  In New York, world leaders are gathered for the United Nations General Assembly, with [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=283.64s)]
*  many taking the stage to address the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=288.44s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to speak tomorrow. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=293.0s)]
*  And yesterday afternoon, Iran's new president, Masoud Pesachian, delivered his first speech [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  to the UN through an interpreter. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=301.8s)]
*  The Islamic Republic of Iran seeks to safeguard its own security, not to create insecurity [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  for others. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  We want peace for all and seek no war or quarrel with anyone. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  Unlike past Iranian presidents who have used the stage to threaten American presidents [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=316.2s)]
*  or deny the Holocaust, Pesachian struck a softer tone. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=320.56s)]
*  He said Tehran was ready to negotiate about its nuclear program. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=324.88s)]
*  He also extended an olive branch to Iran's Western adversaries, with one notable exception, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=328.88s)]
*  Israel. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=334.32s)]
*  It is imperative that the international community should immediately stop the violence and bring [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=335.32s)]
*  about a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and bring an end to the desperate barbarism of Israel [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=339.84s)]
*  in Lebanon before it engulfs the region and the world. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=346.76s)]
*  Analysts who watched the speech say that Pesachian's call for an end to violence is at odds with [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=352.32s)]
*  the country's own actions in the region. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  Iran has long supported and armed militant groups, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=359.48s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=364.36s)]
*  On the same day as Pesachian's speech, Donald Trump's presidential campaign said that U.S. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=372.04s)]
*  intelligence officials warned Trump about threats from Iran to assassinate him. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  Earlier in the year, the U.S. had tracked a potential Iranian plot to kill Trump. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=382.16s)]
*  And while intelligence officials confirmed that they'd briefed the campaign yesterday, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=386.16s)]
*  they didn't specify if the briefing was about that previous threat or a new plot. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=390.16s)]
*  There is no evidence that the assassination attempts against Trump in Pennsylvania and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=395.36s)]
*  Florida were related to Iran. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=399.0s)]
*  American officials say that Iran has been making an ambitious push to influence this [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=402.20000000000005s)]
*  year's presidential election. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=405.72s)]
*  Iranian hackers breached Trump's campaign and tried to get into Kamala Harris's campaign. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=407.88s)]
*  Iran has also made a widespread effort to spread disinformation about the election, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=413.12s)]
*  with the apparent goal of sowing discord and undermining American democracy. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=417.64s)]
*  Just over a week after hip-hop mogul Sean Combs was arrested on charges of sex trafficking, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=435.64s)]
*  another woman has come forward accusing him of drugging her, tying her up, and raping her in 2001. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  It's a pain that reaches into your very core of who you are and even emotional scars that may never fully heal. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  Talia Graves filed a lawsuit against Combs yesterday and spoke at a news conference. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  She says she met Combs, who's also known as Diddy, through her boyfriend at the time, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=462.20000000000005s)]
*  who worked on Combs' music label, and that the assault took place in Combs' recording studio. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=466.48s)]
*  She says she was also assaulted by Combs' bodyguard, Joseph Sherman. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=471.48s)]
*  The lawsuit claims that the rape was filmed and Sherman and Combs showed the footage to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=475.64s)]
*  other people for years following the assault. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=479.8s)]
*  Sherman told the Times he's never met Graves and that he categorically denies the accusations. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  Representatives for Combs didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=487.96s)]
*  These other women have also publicly accused Combs of sexual assault in the past year. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=493.76000000000005s)]
*  Three additional lawsuits have accused him of sexual misconduct. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=497.76000000000005s)]
*  He's currently being held without bail at a jail in Brooklyn. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=500.76000000000005s)]
*  And finally, every day, doctors and patients across the U.S. send hundreds of thousands of messages [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=511.76s)]
*  to each other through a program called MyChart. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=517.76s)]
*  It's used by nearly every hospital system in the country. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=521.48s)]
*  But increasingly, some of the doctors who use the platform are taking advantage of a new feature [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=524.48s)]
*  it offers that drafts their messages using AI. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=529.48s)]
*  The feature has become popular as health systems try to handle a flood of messages from patients [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=532.48s)]
*  who got used to easy, direct communications with their doctors during the pandemic. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=537.48s)]
*  The AI responses are meant to save physicians time. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=542.48s)]
*  When a doctor opens up a message from a patient, they see a generated response from the AI tool [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=545.48s)]
*  that uses old messages and the patient's medical records. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=550.48s)]
*  It can even match the physician's writing style. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=553.48s)]
*  The doctor can then approve or edit the message before sending. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=555.48s)]
*  But the program isn't always accurate. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=559.48s)]
*  It can introduce errors, like telling a patient they've gotten a vaccine when they haven't. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=561.48s)]
*  And without strong federal regulations or widely accepted ethical standards, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=565.48s)]
*  not every hospital system is disclosing to patients that they're using the AI tool. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=570.48s)]
*  One doctor told The Times that if a patient found out a message that sounds like their doctor, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=575.48s)]
*  was actually drafted by an AI bot, they'd feel, quote, rightly betrayed. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=579.48s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao6ltomUEGM&t=588.48s)]
