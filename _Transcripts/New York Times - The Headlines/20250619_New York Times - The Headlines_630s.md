# The MAGA Fight Over Iran, and a Critical Ruling on Transgender Youth Care
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=4.9s)]
*  Today's Thursday, June 19th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=8.56s)]
*  As the war between Israel and Iran forges ahead, Iranians have essentially been cut [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=15.92s)]
*  off from the outside world. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=20.64s)]
*  For more than 12 hours, people there have experienced a near total internet blackout, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=22.5s)]
*  according to an independent monitor. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=27.44s)]
*  An Iranian state news outlet said this was a deliberate decision by the country's own [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=29.74s)]
*  government as it hoped to prevent Israel from using its networks for intelligence and military [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=33.54s)]
*  operations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=38.66s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes have hit Iranian nuclear facilities and killed key military commanders [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=40.22s)]
*  and scientists throughout the country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=44.62s)]
*  They've also destroyed residential and high-rise buildings, killing scores of civilians, according [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=46.82s)]
*  to Iran's health ministry. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=51.58s)]
*  This morning, an Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing serious [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=57.0s)]
*  damage. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=61.12s)]
*  Rescue teams searched for people trapped and injured, and the hospital said its emergency [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=62.12s)]
*  department was treating several patients with mild injuries. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=66.28s)]
*  The fighting continues as uncertainty over possible U.S. involvement hangs over the region. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=69.88s)]
*  A senior Iranian official told the Times that Iran would still be open to meeting with U.S. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=75.6s)]
*  negotiators to discuss a ceasefire with Israel and the future of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=79.92s)]
*  President Trump, meanwhile, has still not said whether he would send American aircraft [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=86.0s)]
*  and weapons to support Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=89.52s)]
*  He told reporters on Wednesday, quote, Nobody knows what I'm going to do. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=91.92s)]
*  Does that mean you haven't made a decision yet on what to do? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=95.72s)]
*  I have ideas as to what to do, but I haven't made a final. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=99.72s)]
*  I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, you know, because things [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  change. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=105.84s)]
*  And that stance is getting pushback from his own base. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=107.12s)]
*  To be honest, this is not MAGA at all. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=110.12s)]
*  I think that we should be very careful about entering into more foreign wars that don't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=112.2s)]
*  help us when our country is dying. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=117.56s)]
*  Right-wing media personalities like Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson have argued, as Trump [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  had for years, that the U.S. should not get involved in another foreign war. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=124.56s)]
*  Outside the White House on Wednesday, the president was asked about criticism from his [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=129.4s)]
*  own supporters. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=133.12s)]
*  So I may have some people that are a little bit unhappy now, but I have some people that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=134.12s)]
*  are very happy and have people outside of the base that can't believe that this is happening. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=138.64s)]
*  They're so happy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump has long had the support of the kind of isolationists who deeply, deeply oppose [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  this kind of intervention. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=151.04s)]
*  But over the past decade, his tent has expanded to include some of the more traditional hawkish [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=153.32s)]
*  members of the Republican Party who he once came to power challenging. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=159.6s)]
*  My colleague, Jess Bidgood, covers politics for the Times. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=164.92s)]
*  Now both wings of the party here are fighting about what the Make America Great Again movement [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=168.04s)]
*  really is. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  There's the purists, the isolationists who were there from the start and who are in this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=175.72s)]
*  moment pretty openly criticizing Trump just for his openness to consider helping Israel [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=180.6s)]
*  by intervening directly in Iran. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=186.68s)]
*  The conservatives defending Trump in this moment say, sure, he has said that he didn't [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  want to start any new wars, but he's also said for a long time that he didn't want Iran [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=200.8s)]
*  And they see his openness to consider intervening here as evidence of him trying to keep that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  promise. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  So all of this raises the question of whether Trump's own base can actually outmaga him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  Steve Bannon, who was once Trump's chief strategist during his first term, has already given some [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=218.84s)]
*  indications that eventually he thinks the base will go along with what Trump decides [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=224.56s)]
*  and that at the end of the day, the base's allegiance to Trump is always going to be [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=230.8s)]
*  stronger than its allegiance to certain ideas or principles that they think he represents. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=236.56s)]
*  The Supreme Court has voted six to three to uphold a Tennessee law banning some transition [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=247.76s)]
*  treatments for transgender youth. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=253.14s)]
*  That ban includes purity blockers and hormone therapies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  Many clinicians who provide these treatments say they can be beneficial and even life-saving [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=258.97999999999996s)]
*  for children who receive them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=263.18s)]
*  The doctor and three families who sued to challenge the state law said it discriminated [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=265.14s)]
*  on the basis of both sex and transgender status, violating the Constitution's equal protection [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=270.06s)]
*  clause. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=275.38s)]
*  They noted that the law allowed for the prohibited treatments to be undertaken for reasons other [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=276.38s)]
*  than gender transition, making it inherently discriminatory. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=280.68s)]
*  But Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion, argued that while there [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=284.72s)]
*  was, quote, fierce scientific and policy debate about the medical treatments, these questions [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=288.6s)]
*  should be left to the states. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  More than two dozen states have restricted gender transition treatments for minors, which [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=295.5s)]
*  could result in a patchwork of laws around the country, leaving care options dependent [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=299.52s)]
*  on where one lives. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=304.0s)]
*  My colleague, Abby Van Sickle, says the decision could signal other rulings to come. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=305.76s)]
*  The court's ruling was a narrow one and that it specifically focused on transgender [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=310.32s)]
*  youths and access to medical care. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=316.0s)]
*  However, the decision could help get a glimpse of how the court might analyze ongoing legal [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=318.76s)]
*  fights on transgender rights more broadly, including issues like bathroom access, sports [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  participation and military service. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=332.0s)]
*  The court ruling comes as the Trump administration is seeking to reduce services and legal recognition [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=334.44s)]
*  for transgender people more broadly. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=343.68s)]
*  On Wednesday, the administration confirmed that it has ordered the National Suicide Prevention [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=346.36s)]
*  Hotline to stop offering specialized support for LGBTQ callers starting next month. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  That specialized support on the 988 hotline was established in 2022 and is run by the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=357.82s)]
*  nonprofit group, the Trevor Project. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=363.34s)]
*  It was born out of a recognition that gay and transgender people often face unique mental [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=365.73999999999995s)]
*  health challenges and have disproportionately high suicide rates. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=370.5s)]
*  But the agency that oversees the hotline said the decision was made to, quote, focus on [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  serving all help seekers. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=379.38s)]
*  The administration had previously characterized the Trevor Project's work as a, quote, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=381.62s)]
*  chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=386.17999999999995s)]
*  The Trevor Project estimates this decision could cut the number of people it serves [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=391.3s)]
*  in half. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=395.22s)]
*  But the organization said it will continue to provide crisis services through its own [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=396.68s)]
*  hotline. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=401.14s)]
*  The Times has learned that the Trump administration is planning to weaken enforcement of gun control [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=407.90000000000003s)]
*  measures. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=412.38s)]
*  According to budget documents, the Justice Department plans to cut down its monitoring [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=413.38s)]
*  of federally licensed gun dealers by slashing the number of inspectors by two thirds at [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=417.8s)]
*  the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=422.92s)]
*  That would sharply limit the federal government's ability to track which businesses sell guns [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=427.44s)]
*  to criminals, traffickers, and people with severe mental illness. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=432.12s)]
*  The inspection program is already woefully understaffed. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=436.58000000000004s)]
*  Some gun licensees can go nearly a decade without facing routine regulatory scrutiny. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=440.02s)]
*  The plans are also part of a broader effort to defang ATF as the White House considers [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=445.5s)]
*  merging the Bureau and the Drug Enforcement Administration into one agency. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Austria, the government there is now moving to tighten restrictions around [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  private gun ownership after a gunman carried out the deadliest school shooting in the country's [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=463.48s)]
*  history last week. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=467.76s)]
*  On Wednesday, the Austrian government proposed a bundle of new measures, including raising [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  the minimum age of handgun ownership, strengthening the mandatory psychological test to buy a [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=473.68s)]
*  gun, and instituting a four-week waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a buyer's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=478.44s)]
*  first weapon. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=483.64s)]
*  The government also wants to double the number of psychologists working in schools. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=485.24s)]
*  Austria has some of the most lax gun ownership laws in Europe and has one of the highest [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=490.44s)]
*  rates of gun ownership in the world, but lawmakers there are expected to approve the new rules [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=494.48s)]
*  by a large majority. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=499.12s)]
*  Austria's chancellor said, quote, We will learn from this tragedy. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=501.0s)]
*  And finally, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=508.6s)]
*  If you're just popping in and joining us, welcome. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=509.6s)]
*  We are making sure that we are fully scaled because we have had immense interest in this [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=511.96s)]
*  auction unsurprisingly. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=515.96s)]
*  Months after the death of legendary filmmaker David Lynch, hundreds of his personal items [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=516.96s)]
*  were auctioned off on Wednesday in Los Angeles. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAyjAJQwmAc&t=521.96s)]
