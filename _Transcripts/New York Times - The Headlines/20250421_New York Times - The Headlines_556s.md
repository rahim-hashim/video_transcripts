# Pope Francis Dies at 88, and Another Hegseth Signal Chat
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, April [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=0.0s)]
*  21st. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=7.04s)]
*  The Vatican announced this morning that Pope Francis has died at 88 years old. The Catholic [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=15.24s)]
*  leader was just in public yesterday. He met with Vice President J.D. Vance and made an [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=21.16s)]
*  appearance in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City for Easter Mass, where he blessed the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=26.279999999999998s)]
*  tens of thousands of people who had gathered to see him. His weak and raspy voice was a [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=30.84s)]
*  reminder of the health issues the pope had faced in recent months, including pneumonia [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  and other complications. His death will set off mourning around the world. There are more [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=46.92s)]
*  than one billion Catholics. Francis was the first pope from Latin America. He was born [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=52.3s)]
*  in Buenos Aires to immigrant parents who fled Italy during the rise of fascism. He said [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  he knew from the age of 16 that he wanted to be a priest, though he hid it from his [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=63.58s)]
*  family, who wanted him to be a doctor. When he finally told his mother his plans, he said, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=67.78s)]
*  quote, I'm going to study the medicine of the soul. As a priest, he rose to the ranks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=73.66s)]
*  of the Catholic Church in Argentina, focusing on outreach to the poor. And it was something [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=78.5s)]
*  of a surprise that he became pope at all. He came to the position only after the previous [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=83.7s)]
*  pope, Benedict XVI, made the rare decision to resign. My colleague Ruth Graham, who covers [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=88.34s)]
*  religion, says in some ways, Pope Francis rocked the institution from his very first [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  days. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=99.86s)]
*  So right out of the gate, Francis jumped into one of the most polarizing topics, not just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=100.86s)]
*  in the church, but sort of in global politics, which is homosexuality. He was asked about [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=106.68s)]
*  the question of gay priests and whether gay men should be able to become priests in the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=111.44s)]
*  Catholic Church. And he said, who am I to judge? That exploded like a bombshell in the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=115.56s)]
*  church and beyond, a real hint of his approach for a lot of people, very hopeful that he [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=122.56s)]
*  would be able to really shift the church on these questions of sexuality. Over the course [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  of his papacy, he kind of made gestures in different directions on that. He allowed priests [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=133.58s)]
*  to bless gay couples, but then he also like reaffirmed church teaching that marriage is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=138.14s)]
*  between a man and a woman. So it's sort of mixed on that. But he was often sort of gesturing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=143.16s)]
*  rhetorically in the direction of open and welcomeness. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=148.46s)]
*  Ruth says Pope Francis also pushed a number of other progressive topics, discussing the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=152.46s)]
*  need to accept migrants and refugees and talking about the consequences of capitalism and climate [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=157.38s)]
*  change. His willingness to discuss all of this earned him some backlash from more conservative [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=162.66s)]
*  Catholics. And it leaves the church at a crossroads now, as cardinals from around the world gather [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=168.1s)]
*  in Vatican City to choose Francis's successor. So looking forward, you know, the question [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=174.22s)]
*  is, is the Catholic Church going to continue in the same mode of Francis's more pastoral [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=179.74s)]
*  approach to his focus on issues that are maybe perceived as more liberal? Or will it tack [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=185.46s)]
*  back to a more conservative bent? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  At this point, Francis has appointed a majority of the cardinals who will be voting, but anything [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=195.06s)]
*  can happen in the conclave. And it's not totally clear that they all share his political [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=200.94s)]
*  priorities. So it's actually really unknown and it will be really interesting to watch. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=206.74s)]
*  The Times has learned that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed information on [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=211.18s)]
*  military strikes in Yemen in another group chat back in March. Hegseth has been under [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=223.9s)]
*  intense scrutiny since it came to light that he posted details for forthcoming military [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=229.06s)]
*  strikes in a chat on the app Signal that inadvertently included the editor of the Atlantic. According [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=233.66s)]
*  to people familiar with the messages, Hegseth also posted some of those same details in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=239.64s)]
*  a separate Signal group that included his wife, his brother, his personal lawyer and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=245.04s)]
*  others from his inner circle. Unlike the previously known group, this one was not made up of government [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=249.92s)]
*  officials with reason to track the progress of the strikes. One person familiar with the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=255.92s)]
*  chat told the Times that Hegseth aides had warned him just days before the strikes not [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=261.03999999999996s)]
*  to discuss sensitive operational details on Signal since the messaging app is not considered [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=267.0s)]
*  as secure as government channels. If details of an airstrike were to leak before it was [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=272.56s)]
*  carried out, military experts say that could endanger the lives of the pilots involved. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=277.68s)]
*  In the face of the controversy, the White House has stood by Hegseth in a statement [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=282.8s)]
*  a White House spokeswoman called the new revelations a quote, non-story. Some Democratic lawmakers, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=287.68s)]
*  however, say the second group chat is fresh proof that Hegseth should be removed from his position. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=293.96s)]
*  This morning, four Democratic lawmakers are in El Salvador to call for the release of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  Kilmar Armando Abrego-Garcia, the man who was wrongly deported by the Trump administration. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=310.84s)]
*  The congressional representatives from California, Florida, Arizona and Oregon landed yesterday. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=316.35999999999996s)]
*  Their visit comes days after Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen visited the country and met [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=321.92s)]
*  with Abrego-Garcia. The lawmakers say they're also there to find out the status of other [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=326.48s)]
*  migrants the federal government deported to El Salvador. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=331.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from using a wartime [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  law to deport another group of migrants this weekend. Before the decision, the administration [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  had been preparing to send more than 50 Venezuelans out of the country, presumably to El Salvador. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=345.72s)]
*  This claimed that the men are gang members affiliated with Tren de Aragua and that the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=351.16s)]
*  Alien Enemies Act gives the administration the right to remove them without legal hearings. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  But around 1 a.m. Saturday, the court issued a one-paragraph order directing the government [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=360.56s)]
*  to not remove any of the detainees until, quote, further order of this court. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=365.92s)]
*  Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=372.12s)]
*  I literally lose sleep over this. I have nightmares about this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=381.16s)]
*  After five years of not penalizing student loan borrowers if they missed a payment, the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=388.24s)]
*  federal government's leniency has ended. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=393.36s)]
*  My payments are so insanely high. I can't really put money in savings. I'm not contributing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=395.76000000000005s)]
*  to 401K. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=401.92s)]
*  And people struggle to start paying again has become clear. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=403.36s)]
*  Because of today, I can't even log into the account. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=406.72s)]
*  Right now, only one-third of the 38 million Americans who borrowed money to pay for school [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=409.64000000000004s)]
*  are making the payments they're supposed to be. Those who aren't have seen their credit [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  scores plunge in the last few months, and loan companies say a record number of people [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  are at risk of defaulting. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  Industry experts point to two primary factors driving the issue. First, borrowers and the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=426.38000000000005s)]
*  companies involved have been through years of major changes and reversals on how and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=432.0s)]
*  when loans should be paid back, sowing confusion and backlog at all levels. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=436.36s)]
*  And second, after such a long pause, many people are just unable to fit the payment [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=441.88s)]
*  back into their budget. They've gotten out of the habit and may now have additional credit [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=446.36s)]
*  card debt or a mortgage. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  The growing number of people behind on their payments has implications for the broader [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=452.72s)]
*  economy. Lower credit scores can keep people from buying or renting homes, and it can also [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=456.44s)]
*  push them toward riskier options like payday loans. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=461.56s)]
*  One economist told the Times, quote, It's not a problem we want to add to the pile. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=465.34s)]
*  For more on how student loans could affect the U.S. economy, listen to today's episode [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=470.46s)]
*  of The Daily. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=474.82s)]
*  And finally, just for starters, how long had you lived in the Palisades? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=475.82s)]
*  Just about 40 years. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=486.58s)]
*  40 years. Okay. Wow. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=488.38s)]
*  More than three months after wildfires swept through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=489.78s)]
*  in Los Angeles, some residents are deciding not to rebuild. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=493.7s)]
*  You know, work through the numbers. And besides the three years, which is what we've been [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=498.42s)]
*  told it would take to rebuild, the money just didn't work. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=502.3s)]
*  My colleague, Jesus Jimenez, has been speaking with homeowners who decided to put what's [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=507.06s)]
*  left of their property up for sale. There have been more than 200 real estate listings [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=510.7s)]
*  recently for charred lots with nothing but debris on them. Some of the sellers are older [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=515.58s)]
*  residents who say they don't have the energy to start from scratch. Others worry that even [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=520.7s)]
*  if they did rebuild, it would mean years of living in a massive burned construction zone. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=525.5s)]
*  Still, the Times talked with real estate agents who say there is a market for the lots. So [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=530.62s)]
*  far, some of them have been going for two or three million dollars just for the dirt. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW2bAN9MA0s&t=544.62s)]
