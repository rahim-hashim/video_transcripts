# Harris Calls Trump Fascist, and U.S. Says North Korea Sent Troops to Russia
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=5.04s)]
*  Today's Thursday, October 24th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=6.04s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=8.64s)]
*  Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=14.18s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=17.32s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=18.32s)]
*  And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=20.92s)]
*  Last night, Kamala Harris publicly called Donald Trump a fascist, using a term that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=26.84s)]
*  the country's highest-ranking Democrats had previously stopped short of saying. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=32.12s)]
*  His former chief of staff, his national security adviser, former secretaries of defense, and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=37.32s)]
*  his vice president have all called him unfit and dangerous. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  They have said explicitly he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=51.14s)]
*  Harris's remarks during a CNN town hall were meant to amplify new comments from John Kelly, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=56.36s)]
*  Trump's former chief of staff, who said Trump meets the definition of a fascist and an authoritarian. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=62.6s)]
*  Kelly made the remarks in an interview with the Times published this week, saying he was [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=69.8s)]
*  speaking out now because he was deeply troubled by Trump's proposal to use the military against [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=73.88s)]
*  Americans who oppose him if he's elected. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  While Trump himself has called Harris a fascist multiple times, the vice president, President [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=82.64s)]
*  Biden, and other top Democrats had previously avoided the charged, provocative term, possibly [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=87.76s)]
*  out of concern it could alienate Republicans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=93.8s)]
*  Now, with the election less than two weeks away, Harris is increasingly framing Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=96.28s)]
*  as anti-democratic. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=102.2s)]
*  In the CNN event, she repeatedly turned questions about her policy platform into warnings about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=103.2s)]
*  what she sees as the dangers of a second Trump term. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=109.64s)]
*  And next week, Harris is set to deliver the closing argument of her campaign at the ellipse [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=113.28s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., the same spot where Trump encouraged his supporters to march on the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=117.8s)]
*  Capitol on January 6th. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=123.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, Elon Musk's million-dollar giveaway stunt to support Donald Trump has caught the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=129.96s)]
*  eye of the Justice Department. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=135.6s)]
*  The department has sent a letter to the super PAC founded by Musk about its sweepstakes, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=138.0s)]
*  where one registered voter a day from a battleground state wins a million dollars for signing the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=142.92s)]
*  PAC's conservative petition. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=147.88s)]
*  The letter warns it might violate federal laws against paying people to register to vote. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=150.16s)]
*  It's not clear what action the department might take against Musk's super PAC. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=155.32s)]
*  I want to be very clear as the Maricopa County attorney. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=160.56s)]
*  Threats, intimidation, or violence toward political officials, no matter what party [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=171.84s)]
*  they are a part of, are completely unacceptable. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=178.8s)]
*  In Arizona, police have arrested a man on terrorism charges in connection with multiple [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=182.6s)]
*  shootings at a Democratic Party campaign office. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=187.84s)]
*  No one was hurt in the shootings, but the building in the suburbs of Phoenix was damaged, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  and the Arizona Democratic Party closed the office after it was hit for the third time [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=196.2s)]
*  earlier this month. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  Authorities say the suspect, 60-year-old Jeffrey Michael Kelly, had also placed anti-Democratic [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=203.12s)]
*  Party signs lined with razor blades near his house, and that when they searched the home, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=208.7s)]
*  they discovered more than 120 guns, 250,000 rounds of ammunition, and a grenade launcher. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=214.04s)]
*  Authorities believe he was, quote, preparing to commit an act of mass casualty. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=221.04s)]
*  At a court hearing, Kelly's attorney argued there were holes in the case. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=225.2s)]
*  His arrest comes as officials nationwide have been warning about threats of violence around [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=230.12s)]
*  the election. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=235.28s)]
*  US officials say that North Korea has sent troops to Russia to support the country's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=242.48s)]
*  war against Ukraine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=247.06s)]
*  Ukraine's been warning about North Korean troops for weeks, and yesterday US officials [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  confirmed that at least 3,000 soldiers have been sent to training sites in Russia. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=253.76s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called it a very, very serious escalation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  When asked why the North Koreans are there, Austin said it could indicate that Vladimir [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=264.44s)]
*  Putin is in, quote, more trouble than most people realize. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=269.48s)]
*  American officials estimate that 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=274.44s)]
*  war so far. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=279.56s)]
*  The country has been using increasingly unorthodox recruitment tactics to replace them, pulling [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=280.88s)]
*  from prisons and hiring soldiers from Cuba and Nepal. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=286.38s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is looking for mercenaries to help in this fight, and he seems to have [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=290.56s)]
*  turned to one of his allies in this war. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=294.8s)]
*  Of course, North Korea has already supplied ammunition for Russia. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=297.88s)]
*  They've supplied short-range ballistic missiles, and now it appears that they are starting [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=302.48s)]
*  to send troops. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=306.88s)]
*  Eric Schmidt covers national security for the Times. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=308.36s)]
*  Secretary Austin and White House officials said on Wednesday they were still trying to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=311.48s)]
*  discern exactly what the North Korean troops would be doing, where they would be going, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=314.76s)]
*  and when this would all happen. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=320.36s)]
*  Now the other thing they're trying to figure out is what is North Korea getting in return [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=322.36s)]
*  for all this? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=326.56s)]
*  They're sending these thousands of troops, presumably to fight in Ukraine. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=327.56s)]
*  The question is, what's the quid pro quo? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=331.76s)]
*  What do they get? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=333.8s)]
*  U.S. officials and other analysts believe that the North Koreans may be interested in [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=334.8s)]
*  getting some kind of missile technology and other, perhaps, advanced weaponry. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=339.48s)]
*  So that's still one of the mysteries that needs to be resolved for American officials, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=344.48s)]
*  is how this relationship is now strengthening between North Korea and Russia. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=348.28s)]
*  I don't like the contract. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=356.56s)]
*  That's just my personal opinion. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=361.32s)]
*  And the people that have been here in this leading industry, the biggest aerospace company [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=363.48s)]
*  in the world, we like to see better from them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=366.36s)]
*  And we deserve better from them. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=368.52s)]
*  Boeing workers rejected a new contract offer from the company yesterday, extending their [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=370.6s)]
*  nearly six-week-long strike and adding to the company's mounting financial problems. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=375.48s)]
*  The strike has hit the heart of Boeing's commercial airline manufacturing, costing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=381.6s)]
*  Boeing tens of millions of dollars each day. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=386.24s)]
*  And that comes on top of other issues. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=389.12s)]
*  The company shared its quarterly financial results yesterday, which showed a more than [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=391.92s)]
*  $6.1 billion loss. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=396.16s)]
*  Boeing's been struggling to recover from a multi-year crisis centered on safety concerns. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=399.56s)]
*  The strike is the latest setback. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  The Biden administration has been trying to help broker a deal. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  Boeing is a huge economic driver for the country and one of the nation's largest exporters. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=411.6s)]
*  The latest contract offer included cumulative raises of nearly 40 percent over four years [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=417.56s)]
*  and additional contributions to retirement plans. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=423.64s)]
*  But the proposal did not bring back a pension plan that's a priority for a lot of union [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=427.2s)]
*  members. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=431.88s)]
*  Several workers told the Times they are holding out for better terms. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=433.66s)]
*  And finally, for anyone who's creeping up at the airport gate and trying to board way [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=442.36s)]
*  before your zone, American Airlines is about to call you out on that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=448.88s)]
*  The company is testing a new system to deal with those lurkers, swarmers, and line cutters [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=455.12s)]
*  — the people industry insiders call gate lice. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=460.56s)]
*  If a passenger tries to board before their group is called, the system sets off an alarm [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=464.96000000000004s)]
*  and alerts the gate agent. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=470.16s)]
*  The scoff-law will then be sent back to wait. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=471.96000000000004s)]
*  It's still in the early days of testing. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=475.08000000000004s)]
*  Anyone flying through Albuquerque, Tucson, or Washington's Reagan Airport may see it [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=477.54s)]
*  in action. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=481.76000000000005s)]
*  Travel experts say gate lice have become more of an issue in recent years because checked [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=483.68s)]
*  bag fees have gone up and passengers are now fighting for limited space in overhead bins. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=488.72s)]
*  American Airlines says so far it's been pleased with the system, and so are some travelers, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=495.2s)]
*  including one who posted online that they had fun, quote, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=500.68s)]
*  "...witnessing sneaky passengers getting served embarrassing justice in front of everyone." [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=504.28s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=512.56s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a political roundtable with four Times reporters breaking down this [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=514.08s)]
*  week's campaign news. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmlC8a0qpkk&t=519.08s)]
