# Harvard vs. Trump, and Your (Shrinking) Chance of Being Audited
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, April [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=0.0s)]
*  15th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Harvard has now become the first school to refuse to comply with the Trump administration's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=14.52s)]
*  pressure campaign on American universities. Yesterday, Harvard's president rejected a [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=19.36s)]
*  list of demands that the administration had sent. It had called for significant changes [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=25.12s)]
*  to the day-to-day operations of the institution, like ordering Harvard to shut down all programming [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=30.04s)]
*  related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, requiring it to report international students [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=35.8s)]
*  who commit conduct violations to federal authorities, and mandating outside oversight of its academic [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=41.6s)]
*  departments to ensure they are, quote, viewpoint diverse among other demands. In a statement, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=49.74s)]
*  Harvard's president said, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=56.14s)]
*  No government, regardless of which party is in power, should dictate what private universities [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=57.14s)]
*  can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  pursue. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=68.26s)]
*  Within hours of Harvard's refusal, the Trump administration announced it would freeze more [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=69.7s)]
*  than $2 billion in federal funding for the school. That adds to the billions of dollars [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=74.06s)]
*  the administration has already paused for other elite universities, as Trump and his [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=79.5s)]
*  closest advisors and allies have been pushing to fundamentally reshape American higher education. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  They've claimed the schools have allowed anti-Semitism to go unchecked on their campuses. Many conservatives [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=90.94s)]
*  have also argued more broadly that the institutions have been taken over by leftists and need [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=96.92s)]
*  to be overhauled. One of the Trump allies prominently pushing that view is the conservative [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  activist Christopher Ruffo, who told The Daily in a recent interview that using federal funds [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=107.7s)]
*  as leverage over the institutions is central to their strategy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  Nice words, pleasing sounds, promises to change, all of those very pleasant and non-confrontational [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=118.30000000000001s)]
*  proposals regarding academia have not worked. And so look, the raw material of politics [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=128.1s)]
*  is money, power, and status. And so I'm thinking about how can we take away their money? How [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=135.02s)]
*  can we take away their power? How can we take away their status? So that they have to change. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=141.06s)]
*  At the White House yesterday. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=155.06s)]
*  How can I return him to the United States? It's like I smuggle him into the United States. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=156.5s)]
*  Of course, I'm not going to do it. I mean, the question is reposts. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=160.46s)]
*  The president of El Salvador, Najib Bukele, said he will not return the man that the U.S. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=165.74s)]
*  mistakenly deported to a mega prison there last month, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=171.06s)]
*  Abrego Garcia is from El Salvador, but had legal permission to stay in the U.S. and was [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=176.9s)]
*  living in Maryland with his family before he was detained. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=182.1s)]
*  How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't have the power to return him [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=185.06s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=189.94s)]
*  Officials have claimed he's a violent gang member, but he's never been charged or convicted [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=191.34s)]
*  of that. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must take steps [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=195.74s)]
*  to get him back, but it's been refusing to do so. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=201.06s)]
*  And in his Oval Office meeting with Bukele, President Trump said he wants to ramp up [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=204.94s)]
*  deportations to El Salvador and send as many people as possible to the country, which the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=210.14s)]
*  U.S. is paying to jail migrants. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  And I just asked the president, you know, it's this massive complex that he built, jail [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=218.22s)]
*  complex. I said, can you build some more of them, please? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=223.18s)]
*  Trump also said he'd even like to send American citizens there if they've been convicted of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=227.06s)]
*  violent crimes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=232.5s)]
*  I'd like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country, but you'll [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=233.82s)]
*  have to be looking at the laws on that, Steve. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=237.86s)]
*  OK. Today [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=239.9s)]
*  is Tax Day in the U.S. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=251.38000000000002s)]
*  And for most Americans, the chance of being audited, having their tax records checked [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=253.3s)]
*  and investigated, has dropped to historically low levels. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=258.26s)]
*  A Times analysis of IRS data shows that the audit rate for personal income tax returns [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  dipped to just around a third of a percent in 2023. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=268.62s)]
*  That's less than half of what it was a decade ago. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=272.86s)]
*  Fewer audits have led to less revenue for the government. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=276.02000000000004s)]
*  With its audits of tax returns for the year 2010, for example, the IRS got an additional [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=279.94s)]
*  11 billion dollars. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=285.54s)]
*  Its audits for 2019 returns, though, only brought in 4.5 billion. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=287.74s)]
*  Part of the reason for the drop has been a staffing shortage, something the Biden [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  administration tried to reverse. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=296.70000000000005s)]
*  But the Trump administration's now planning deep cuts, targeting at least 25 percent of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=298.90000000000003s)]
*  the agency staff, which would almost certainly make audits even more rare. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=304.3s)]
*  The president and other Republicans have likened audits to harassment. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=308.94s)]
*  One IRS employee told the Times she was in the middle of working on an audit, what she [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=313.14000000000004s)]
*  called a slam dunk case for the IRS, when she and four other staffers working on it [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=317.78s)]
*  were laid off this year. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=323.02s)]
*  Now, she says it's unclear if it will ever be finished. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=324.7s)]
*  Surgeons in Massachusetts recently pulled off what had seemed impossible. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  They successfully transplanted a kidney that had previously been frozen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=341.94s)]
*  The patient was a pig, not a human, but researchers hope it might lead to a major breakthrough [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=346.7s)]
*  in organ transplants for people. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=351.86s)]
*  Right now, kidneys must be transplanted within 24 to 36 hours, a tight window that makes [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  lining up the right match very difficult. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=360.66s)]
*  If the organs could be frozen and stored, transplant surgeons say that would be a game [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=363.42s)]
*  changer. For the recent breakthrough, researchers took inspiration from another animal, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=368.3s)]
*  Canadian wood frogs. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=374.14s)]
*  In the winter, the frogs can basically freeze themselves. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=376.09999999999997s)]
*  All of their cellular processes stop, so do their hearts. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=379.62s)]
*  They're basically dead until spring. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=383.18s)]
*  Scientists realized the frog's secret was that they flooded their cells with glucose [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=386.02s)]
*  before the cold set in. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=391.02s)]
*  Scientists used a version of that technique with the pig kidney to protect it from damage [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=392.82s)]
*  in the freezing process. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  The research is still ongoing and far from being tested on a human, but the hope is it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=399.46000000000004s)]
*  will eventually help cut back on the wait lists for a kidney transplant. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=404.14s)]
*  Those lists currently have almost 100,000 people on them. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=408.98s)]
*  And finally, the price of Lego sets has been skyrocketing among fans and collectors. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=419.74s)]
*  Some of the themed kits of plastic bricks are going for way over their original purchase [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=425.70000000000005s)]
*  price. One Spider-Man set from 2013 is now valued at over $16,000, which is a lot for [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=430.5s)]
*  something you could accidentally vacuum up a piece of. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=438.58000000000004s)]
*  The eye-popping prices have come with a dark side. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  A Pierce County Lego retailer is out of thousands of dollars after someone breaks into [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=445.14000000000004s)]
*  their store and loads a U-Haul with high-end collectible sets. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=450.46000000000004s)]
*  There have been Lego heists around the country. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  More than $400,000 worth of Legos were stolen from Walmarts and Target stores. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=457.26000000000005s)]
*  Stores say they've dealt with it for a few years, but it's been ramping up as people [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=463.42s)]
*  have been clamoring online for limited editions and special kits. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=467.66s)]
*  One expert who runs a YouTube channel about investing in Lego told the Times that the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=471.82000000000005s)]
*  sets have basically become just like other coveted merchandise that can be stolen and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  resold like jewelry or rare sneakers. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=481.62s)]
*  One thing I learned this morning, the plural of Lego is Lego, never Legos, according to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=485.3s)]
*  the company. So if your 7,500 piece Millennium Falcon set goes missing, you'll need to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=491.66s)]
*  say, I'd like to report my stolen Lego. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=497.74s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=503.58s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a closer look at the case of the man who was wrongfully deported to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=505.02s)]
*  El Salvador and how it's become a test of presidential power. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=509.5s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=513.78s)]
*  podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=517.14s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-XLWPjTSM&t=519.62s)]
