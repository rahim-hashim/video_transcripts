# Early Votes Pour In, and a U.S. Warning to Israel Over Gaza
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, October 16th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=6.36s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=8.8s)]
*  Early voting has now officially begun in most states and the votes are pouring in. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=14.64s)]
*  At least five million people have already cast their ballots, whether in person or by mail. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=20.16s)]
*  That's roughly 3% of registered voters in an election that could come down to the thinnest [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=25.56s)]
*  of margins. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=30.64s)]
*  In Georgia, the polls opened yesterday and the battleground state saw a record number [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  of voters before the day was even half over. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=36.76s)]
*  With just three weeks to go until election day, both candidates are now narrowing in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=40.12s)]
*  on specific groups they hope will move the needle. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump was in Chicago yesterday making his pitch to business leaders in an interview [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  with the editor in chief of Bloomberg News. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  If you add up all the promises you've made and your plans would add $7.5 trillion to the debt, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=55.72s)]
*  that's more than twice the total for Vice President Harris. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=63.52s)]
*  Trump was pressed about the cost of his economic plans, which budget watchers think could explode [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=67.48s)]
*  the country's already ballooning debt. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=73.04s)]
*  Why should they trust you with that? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=75.88s)]
*  Because we're about growth. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=77.72s)]
*  She's got no growth whatsoever and we're all about growth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=78.72s)]
*  We're going to bring companies back to our country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=81.8s)]
*  Meanwhile Kamala Harris gave an interview yesterday with the radio host Charlemagne [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  the God in Detroit, a key city in another battleground state. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=90.32s)]
*  Listen, I feel very strongly I need to earn every vote, which is why I'm here having this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=94.2s)]
*  candid conversation with you and your listeners. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=98.88s)]
*  Harris spent the hour often focusing her answers on the concerns of black Americans. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=101.4s)]
*  What is true is that I am running to be president for everybody, but I'm clear-eyed about the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=106.4s)]
*  history and the disparities that exist for specific communities and I'm not going to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  shy away from that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=117.64s)]
*  Both candidates will continue their targeted appeals today and they'll both be on Fox. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=119.72s)]
*  Trump with a town hall focused on women's issues and Harris sitting for an interview [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=125.12s)]
*  that's likely to reach a more conservative audience than her other appearances. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  As her campaign tries to peel off Republican voters. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=133.92s)]
*  The Biden administration is warning Israel that it will cut off military aid to the country [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=143.0s)]
*  if Israel doesn't do more to get humanitarian supplies into Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  According to the State Department, supplies recently dropped to the lowest level they've [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  been at since the war began. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=156.6s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken issued the warning [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=159.2s)]
*  in a private letter on Sunday to Israeli officials. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=163.56s)]
*  In it, they said Israel has 30 days to increase the flow of goods. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=167.4s)]
*  Otherwise, the letter said, Israel would be in violation of a U.S. law that prevents the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=171.6s)]
*  government from giving military aid to any country that's blocking humanitarian supplies [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=176.76s)]
*  the U.S. has provided. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=181.84s)]
*  This isn't the first time that the Biden administration has warned Israel that it risks potentially [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=183.84s)]
*  triggering a cutoff of American military aid if humanitarian supplies into Gaza don't increase. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  Michael Crowley covers the State Department for the Times. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  There was a similar warning back in April, and Biden officials felt that that warning [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=200.26s)]
*  actually did have a positive effect, that the Israelis paid attention and began to allow [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  substantially more aid into Gaza. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=212.22s)]
*  But the key from the U.S. perspective was that that aid had to be sustained. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=215.78s)]
*  It couldn't be a one-time thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=220.22s)]
*  So it's not clear yet how Israel might respond to this warning. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=222.26s)]
*  I talked to one longtime Middle East expert, Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East peace [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=225.5s)]
*  negotiator, and he was very skeptical that anything would significantly change. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=230.86s)]
*  Miller's prediction was that Israel will basically do as little as it can in terms of allowing [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=236.22s)]
*  more aid into Gaza to prevent some kind of dramatic response from the Biden administration, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=243.78s)]
*  like restrictions on weapons transfers or even a complete cutoff of military aid, and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=250.66s)]
*  that the Biden administration really doesn't want to take steps like that, and so that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=257.98s)]
*  it will probably accept what small amount Israel is willing to do, continuing what has [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=263.3s)]
*  basically been a pattern for the past year. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=269.58s)]
*  As Israel faces new pressure in Gaza, it's continuing to carry out attacks in Lebanon, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=273.78s)]
*  targeting what it says are Hezbollah sites. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=286.34s)]
*  Times correspondent Alyssa Rubin says the signs of war in Lebanon are now everywhere. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=289.29999999999995s)]
*  We get up some mornings and the sky has that kind of haziness that if you've spent time [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=294.41999999999996s)]
*  in war zones comes after there has been a lot of bombing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=300.94s)]
*  What is really striking to me here is the constant presence of drones. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  The evening I came, I wanted to go around the corner and buy some extra water, and there [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  was this buzzing, and I had never heard it quite so close, and I've come to realize, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=317.7s)]
*  oh, that's a drone right almost, it sounds like, over me. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=325.3s)]
*  And now I'm getting used to it, but you're very aware, is that drone watching you? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=329.98s)]
*  Is that drone potentially going to fire in your vicinity? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=335.66s)]
*  Alyssa says the violence has caused havoc across the country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  Nearly a million people have fled their homes, sometimes waiting until the last minute, reluctant [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=345.22s)]
*  to leave. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=350.1s)]
*  One was a family I met up in Tripoli, and they really delayed because the father had [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=351.48s)]
*  just finished building their house himself. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=357.22s)]
*  He was a carpenter, and he didn't want to leave this place he built and was just waiting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=359.74s)]
*  to paint. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=365.54s)]
*  But they had two university-aged children, and they had an autistic son of nine who was [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=367.18s)]
*  terrified by the bombing, and eventually they did leave. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=374.06s)]
*  And all the father kept saying is, we just want a normal life. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=379.06s)]
*  And that is a phrase you hear over and over. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=384.82s)]
*  In North Carolina, nearly 100 people are still missing more than two weeks after flooding [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=394.7s)]
*  from Hurricane Helene washed away homes and roads in the western part of the state. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=399.58s)]
*  The death toll from the storm is over 90 there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=404.9s)]
*  At a press conference, Governor Roy Cooper said crews are still working to clear roads [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=408.0s)]
*  and to restore power and water to places like Asheville. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=412.66s)]
*  Our response to this disaster is strong. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=415.86s)]
*  However, there's still a persistent and dangerous flow of misinformation about recovery efforts [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=418.78s)]
*  in western North Carolina. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=425.66s)]
*  The governor also called out the wild rumors that have led to threats against federal emergency [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=426.66s)]
*  management workers. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=431.86s)]
*  FEMA temporarily stopped sending some of its workers door to door to offer help because [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=433.62s)]
*  of the threats. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=438.18s)]
*  If you're participating in spreading this stuff, stop it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=439.54s)]
*  Whatever your aim is, the people you are really hurting are those in western North Carolina [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=443.86s)]
*  who need help. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=450.06s)]
*  And finally, the things that go on a wedding registry are always changing with the times. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=457.46000000000004s)]
*  People used to ask for a full set of china or like a jello mold. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=463.0s)]
*  Now maybe they ask for a Roomba. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=467.34s)]
*  But one request is becoming more popular than ever. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=470.06s)]
*  Couples are asking their guests to help pay for a house. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  According to the Not an online wedding resource, the number of couples asking for donations [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  for a down payment has jumped by more than half since 2018. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  That can raise eyebrows among some who feel like asking for cash is improper etiquette. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=487.94s)]
*  But attitudes are changing, and couples are facing a crushing housing market where homeownership [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=492.9s)]
*  has become increasingly inaccessible. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=498.34s)]
*  According to Zola, another wedding website, housing is not the only big ticket item brides [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=501.62s)]
*  and grooms are putting on the registry now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=506.94s)]
*  Honeymoon funds have become common, and they also found couples asking for donations towards [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=509.85999999999996s)]
*  paying off student loans or for fertility treatments. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=514.3s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=523.6999999999999s)]
*  Today, on The Daily, a look at the race in Montana that could end up deciding who will [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=524.6999999999999s)]
*  control the Senate. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=529.86s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=531.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx6bsD7Fxo&t=537.4599999999999s)]
