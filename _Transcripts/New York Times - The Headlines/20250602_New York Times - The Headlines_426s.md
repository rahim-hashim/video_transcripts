# Attack in Colorado, Ukraine Targets Russian Bases, Carmakers Warn on Magnet Shortage | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Monday, June 2nd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=7.76s)]
*  When this call came out today, our officers rushed as quickly as they could and they immediately [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=14.44s)]
*  ran into a chaotic situation where a man was throwing Molotov cocktails. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  In Boulder, Colorado yesterday, a group of demonstrators who regularly gather on Sundays [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=24.16s)]
*  to march in support of Israeli hostages was attacked. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  Witnesses are reporting that the subject threw an incendiary device into the crowd. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=33.04s)]
*  The suspect was heard to yell, free Palestine, during the attack. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=38.24s)]
*  In all, eight people were injured, two of whom were airlifted to a burn unit. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  Boulder's mayor described the group as Jewish community members who were on a march for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  peace and for hostage return. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=50.96s)]
*  The FBI said a 45-year-old man identified as Mohammed Sabri Salman was arrested at the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  scene. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=58.0s)]
*  As a result of these preliminary facts, it is clear that this is a targeted act of violence [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=59.04s)]
*  and the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=63.88s)]
*  The attack has intensified fears about the backlash to Israel's military campaign in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=68.24s)]
*  Gaza, coming less than two weeks after two Israeli embassy aides were shot and killed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=72.36s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=76.98s)]
*  In Gaza yesterday, according to local health officials, more than 20 people were shot and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=84.56s)]
*  killed and almost 200 were wounded as they waited at an aid distribution center. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=89.0s)]
*  The crowd had gathered overnight to try and beat the rush to get food. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=94.8s)]
*  The Israeli military initially said it was unaware of any injuries from Israeli fire [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=98.78s)]
*  at the location, but a military official later told reporters that troops had fired what [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=103.2s)]
*  were described as warning shots toward, quote, suspects. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=108.72s)]
*  The incident is the latest involving the new aid distribution system in Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=112.88s)]
*  Until recently, Israel had blocked all aid into the territory. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=117.28s)]
*  Now civilians are being directed to a handful of tightly controlled sites. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  The rollout began last week. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=126.24s)]
*  While some days have gone smoothly, there have also been chaotic scenes, including one [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=128.24s)]
*  other instance in which Israeli forces said they fired warning shots. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  Over the weekend, Ukraine launched a stunning attack on Russian air bases, stretching all [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=143.48s)]
*  the way from near Norway in the west to Siberia in the east. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=148.88s)]
*  The full scope of the damage is still becoming clear. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=153.12s)]
*  What we do know, even with this limited information, is that this was one of the most audacious [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=156.0s)]
*  attacks of the Ukrainians to date. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  My colleague Mark Santora says the attack was so unexpected, some military analysts [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=162.06s)]
*  have likened it to the surprise of Pearl Harbor. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=167.04s)]
*  The Ukrainians had been trying to find a way to hit Russia's airfields to cut off their [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=170.16s)]
*  ability to continue launching relentless bombing campaigns on Ukrainian towns and cities. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=174.72s)]
*  They tried in the past with long-range weapons, but the Russians had adapted. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=180.2s)]
*  So what the Ukrainians did this time was basically drive right up to the bases by secreting these [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=184.78s)]
*  drones in the backs of trailers and then releasing them remotely so that the Russian defenses [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=190.72s)]
*  were essentially useless. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=196.8s)]
*  While the New York Times hasn't been able to confirm the full extent of the damage, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=198.96s)]
*  Ukrainian intelligence services and President Zelensky said that 41 Russian bombers, some [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=203.16s)]
*  34 percent of the fleet, were damaged or destroyed, which is worth an estimated $7 billion, carried [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=207.96s)]
*  out by little drones that cost, you know, a few thousand dollars each. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=215.0s)]
*  Russia also launched a major attack this weekend, sending around 500 drones and decoys into [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=226.28s)]
*  Relegations from the two countries are scheduled to meet later today in Istanbul for peace [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=227.28s)]
*  talks, but expectations of a breakthrough are low. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=231.44s)]
*  American auto executives are warning that the U.S. trade war with China could force [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=240.0s)]
*  them to cut back production in the coming days and weeks because they're running out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=244.64s)]
*  of magnets. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=248.96s)]
*  The magnets are made from rare earth metals, a resource China has a near total lock on. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=250.48s)]
*  The country stopped exporting the metals last month. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=256.24s)]
*  Though China and the U.S. have reached something of a trade truce for the moment, China's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=259.2s)]
*  continued to limit access to the materials, which are critical not only to cars — they're [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=264.2s)]
*  used in motors, brakes, and steering — but also to everything from semiconductors to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=269.24s)]
*  fighter jets. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  One economic analyst called America's dependence on rare earth magnets an Achilles heel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=275.16s)]
*  Some American factories hope to start producing rare earth magnets this year, but China has [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=281.1s)]
*  a significant head start on mining, production, and research. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=286.2s)]
*  Dozens of universities there offer rare earth chemistry programs, which have found more [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=290.56s)]
*  efficient ways to process the metals. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=295.56s)]
*  The U.S. has zero similar programs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=297.96s)]
*  And finally, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=308.76s)]
*  In Canada, the country's last old school department store chain is closing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=309.56s)]
*  Granted, chain stores taking a hit these days is not uncommon — RIP Kmart and almost every [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=320.76s)]
*  Sears. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=326.8s)]
*  But the Hudson's Bay Company is the oldest corporation on the continent, founded 355 [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=327.96s)]
*  years ago, long before Canada or the U.S. were even countries. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  It was not a department store then, of course. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=339.44s)]
*  Britain set it up as a fur trading company. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=342.36s)]
*  The full name? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=344.96s)]
*  The Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=346.24s)]
*  It was given a vast stretch of territory, about a third of what's now Canada. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=351.0s)]
*  There was no consideration of the Indigenous people who already lived there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=356.14s)]
*  Hudson's Bay Company established remote trading posts and relied on Indigenous trappers [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=360.04s)]
*  for beaver pelts and other resources. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  For the centuries, it evolved from a major force in colonizing North America to its final [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=367.92s)]
*  form, a sprawling department store chain with perfume counters and a small army of mannequins, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  which are also now for sale as the stores close. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=379.88s)]
*  The company filed for bankruptcy in March. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  One shopper raiding one of the final clearance sales in downtown Ottawa told the Times she [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  had a love-hate relationship with the store. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=390.68s)]
*  For her, it was a mix of nostalgia but with the dark side of Canada's colonial history. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=393.24s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=402.04s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Times investigative reporters walk through what they uncovered about Elon [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=403.04s)]
*  Musk's chaotic life on the campaign trail. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app where you can listen wherever you get your [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=411.92s)]
*  podcasts. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVQvwiGj3w&t=416.96000000000004s)]
