# Musk Slams Trump’s Policy Bill, and Steel Tariffs Double
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, June 4th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=7.8s)]
*  Caroline, how mad do you think President Trump is going to be when he finds out that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=11.8s)]
*  Elon Musk said this massive outrageous pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=18.04s)]
*  abomination? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=23.48s)]
*  Shame on those who voted for him. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=24.48s)]
*  Elon Musk is no longer trying to present a united front with the White House. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=26.16s)]
*  On social media, he lashed out again at President Trump's signature domestic policy bill, just [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=30.92s)]
*  as Trump's been trying to keep the divisive bill on track. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=36.68s)]
*  Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=39.64s)]
*  It doesn't change the president's opinion. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  This is one big, beautiful bill. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  While Trump's publicly urging Republican senators to get the bill to his desk by the Fourth [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  of July, Musk has been railing against it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=50.68s)]
*  He posted on social media that it will, quote, massively increase the already gigantic budget [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=53.96s)]
*  deficit, the deficit he was personally focused on reducing with the Department of Government [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=58.76s)]
*  efficiency. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=63.2s)]
*  Musk also wrote that in November next year, quote, we fire all politicians who betrayed [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=64.84s)]
*  the American people, suggesting that in the midterms he could put his resources into trying [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=70.0s)]
*  to unseat congressional Republicans who back the bill. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Are you concerned that he could help tank this bill and whip members against it? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=77.88s)]
*  Well, in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune faced questions about whether Musk, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=83.08s)]
*  the world's richest man, has enough influence with lawmakers to sink the whole thing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=90.08s)]
*  Late last year, Musk managed to torpedo a bipartisan spending bill using similar threats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=95.44s)]
*  For this bill, the GOP has such a slim majority in the Senate, they can only afford to lose [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  three votes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=105.84s)]
*  At least some Republicans have already come out against it, including Mike Lee of Utah [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=107.08s)]
*  and Rand Paul of Kentucky. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=111.96s)]
*  We can't accumulate more debt. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=113.44s)]
*  They're planning on spending $5 trillion they don't have. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=115.16s)]
*  And I'm just not for that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=117.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the House, where Republicans already pushed the bill through, some now [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  have regrets. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said that because lawmakers didn't get the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=128.04s)]
*  full text until right before the vote, she missed the fact that the bill blocks states [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=132.28s)]
*  from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=137.8s)]
*  But I find it so problematic that I'm willing to come forward and admit that those are two [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=141.12s)]
*  pages that I didn't read because I never want to see a situation where state rights are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=145.84s)]
*  stripped away. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=153.12s)]
*  Also, Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska said he didn't know that the bill limits [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=154.4s)]
*  judges' powers to hold people in contempt for violating court orders. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=158.76s)]
*  Republicans tucked that provision in as they've moved to curb the power of the federal courts. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=163.8s)]
*  Flood said he would not have voted for the measure if he'd realized. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=168.68s)]
*  Both Greene and Flood have urged Senate Republicans to strike out the provisions they overlooked. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=171.96s)]
*  Now, three quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=184.24s)]
*  Decades of Washington betrayals and incompetence and stupidity and corruption cost this region [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  over 100,000 steel jobs and they've melted away just like butter melts away. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=195.0s)]
*  U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports doubled today from 25% to 50. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=201.52s)]
*  As President Trump ratchets up the surcharges, he claims will revitalize American metal production. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=207.56s)]
*  Similar tariffs Trump put in place during his first term did help American metal producers, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=214.28s)]
*  according to an analysis from the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent bipartisan [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=219.52s)]
*  government agency. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=224.36s)]
*  But the analysis also found it hurt the broader economy by raising prices for many other industries. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=226.08s)]
*  Also, the administration announced that it's rescinded a federal policy that required hospitals [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=233.08s)]
*  to provide emergency abortions to women whose health is at risk. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=240.4s)]
*  The Biden administration put the requirement in place after the Supreme Court overturned [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  Roe v. Wade. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  It had applied even in states where the procedure was restricted or banned. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=250.2s)]
*  Now, the Trump administration has left it somewhat murky how hospitals should proceed. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=254.11999999999998s)]
*  One health law expert told the Times the change, quote, basically gives a green light to hospitals [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  in red states to turn away pregnant women who are in peril. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=265.44s)]
*  Abortion opponents were pleased by the move. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=270.0s)]
*  An executive at the conservative group, the Heritage Foundation, said President Trump [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=272.24s)]
*  was dismantling what he called abortion radicalism. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=276.16s)]
*  And at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to review a list [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  of ships named in honor of civil rights leaders to potentially remove those names. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=285.72s)]
*  The list includes Harvey Milk, who was one of the country's first openly gay elected [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  officials and a Navy veteran. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=295.48s)]
*  According to a senior defense official, Hegseth's order is intended as a rebuke of Pride Month [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=298.44000000000005s)]
*  in keeping with the Trump administration's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=304.0s)]
*  efforts. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=307.6s)]
*  An official told the Times the list also includes naval vessels named for Thurgood Marshall, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=308.6s)]
*  the first black Supreme Court justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Harriet Tubman, among others. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=313.2s)]
*  The Pentagon said in a statement yesterday that Hegseth is committed to ensuring that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  all names are, quote, reflective of the commander in chief's priorities, our nation's history [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=322.56s)]
*  and the warrior ethos. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, today marks the start of the Hajj, an annual event in which millions [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=333.92s)]
*  of Muslims from around the world make the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=340.92s)]
*  It's one of the largest human gatherings on the planet. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  But for the Saudi government, the Hajj has also become a source of intense scrutiny, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=348.64000000000004s)]
*  as extreme heat and packed crowds have led to the deaths of thousands of pilgrims in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=353.6s)]
*  recent years. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=357.76s)]
*  Thirteen hundred people died during last year's Hajj when temperatures soared past [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=359.28s)]
*  120 degrees. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=363.11999999999995s)]
*  Many of them had made the trip without the proper permits, so they didn't have access [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=365.2s)]
*  to official cooling stations and tents with air conditioning. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=368.84s)]
*  This year, Saudi authorities are cracking down. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=372.67999999999995s)]
*  Officials say they've already stopped more than 200,000 people who didn't have permits [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=375.64s)]
*  from entering Mecca. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  They've also poured billions of dollars into improvements like crowd control programs and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=380.76s)]
*  expanded a system of cooled roads, as many pilgrims walk some 10 miles a day during the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  event. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  And the extreme heat isn't going anywhere. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=392.0s)]
*  The shifting Islamic calendar, which is based on lunar cycles, has the Hajj falling during [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=394.84s)]
*  the warmer months for at least several more years. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=399.55999999999995s)]
*  And finally, smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed parts of the upper Midwest yesterday, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=410.06s)]
*  triggering air quality alerts, and parts of the East Coast may be at risk today. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=415.54s)]
*  Down along the Gulf Coast, people are also on the lookout for hazy skies, but for a very [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=420.78000000000003s)]
*  different reason. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=425.54s)]
*  A giant cloud of dust the size of the continental U.S. has been floating over the Atlantic Ocean [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=427.02s)]
*  and is expected to spread along the coastline this week. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=433.9s)]
*  The plume started in the Sahara, 5,000 miles away in North Africa, and has been on the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=437.3s)]
*  move. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=442.26s)]
*  Over the weekend, it swept through the Caribbean. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=443.26s)]
*  Now it could turn skies from Florida to Texas a slight reddish tint, potentially through [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=445.58s)]
*  Friday. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=450.82s)]
*  Dust clouds like this aren't unexpected, but this one is particularly large. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=452.06s)]
*  And it's actually good news for those watching hurricane season, which officially started [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=456.48s)]
*  this week. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=460.7s)]
*  The dry air and strong winds that brought the dust can suppress tropical storms, which [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=461.9s)]
*  need moisture to grow. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=467.17999999999995s)]
*  So there's an ongoing battle essentially between storms trying to form and the dust [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=468.97999999999996s)]
*  layer overpowering them. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=473.38s)]
*  The whole thing's one of the great wonders of the weather world. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=475.34s)]
*  One meteorologist told the Times, it's as if Mother Nature set up a Saharan dust factory [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=478.94s)]
*  right next to the hurricane nursery. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=483.94s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=488.62s)]
*  The inside story of Operation Spider's Web, Ukraine's audacious sneak attack on Russian [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=491.14000000000004s)]
*  warplanes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=497.02000000000004s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=498.02000000000004s)]
*  podcasts. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=501.54s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=502.54s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A6nQUbWang&t=503.54s)]
