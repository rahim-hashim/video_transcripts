# L.A.’s Private Firefighters, and U.S. Childhood Vaccination Rates Fall
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Monday, January 13th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=7.76s)]
*  With the impending winds, we've got to pay really, really close attention to this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=14.36s)]
*  This wind event is approaching us and it's approaching us very, very quickly. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=19.28s)]
*  Officials in California are sounding the alarm that a new surge in wind could fuel two massive [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=24.0s)]
*  fires that are continuing to burn in Los Angeles. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  Starting later today, winds are expected to pick up and stay strong through Wednesday, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  with gusts up to 60 miles per hour. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=37.96s)]
*  It's not over. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  So we need everybody to stay safe. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  And I tell you from the first responders that are here, we're going to keep fighting this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  fight. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=49.16s)]
*  Over the weekend, a slight break in the winds had allowed firefighters to start getting [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=50.16s)]
*  control of the blazes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=54.16s)]
*  The Palisades fire along the coast is now 13% contained. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=56.08s)]
*  The Eaton fire near Pasadena is about a quarter contained. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Officials say that at least 24 people have died in the fires. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=64.32s)]
*  And with more reported missing, they say they expect the death toll to rise. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=68.08s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=73.28s)]
*  Driving around Pacific Palisades right now, you'll see white pickup trucks that indicate [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=76.64s)]
*  that they are working for private firefighting crews. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=81.48s)]
*  My colleague Tim Arango is based in Los Angeles. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=84.84s)]
*  He's been reporting on what's become a coveted and controversial resource, private firefighters, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  which can cost as much as $10,000 a day. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=93.92s)]
*  On a street called Monument Street, which runs down close to the central business district, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  on one side of the street is house after house and lot after lot of destroyed homes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=101.84s)]
*  On the other side is an upscale outdoor shopping mall that survived largely intact. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=106.22s)]
*  And I spoke to Rick Caruso, who owns that outdoor shopping mall, and he said he had [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=111.32s)]
*  brought in a team of firefighters from Arizona that he had used before to assist in the effort. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  Demand for private firefighters has shot up in recent years as the risk of fires has grown. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=122.24s)]
*  While it's rare for individual homeowners to hire private crews, insurance companies [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=128.0s)]
*  bring them in to try and head off major losses on high-end properties. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=132.6s)]
*  But public backlash against the service has also been growing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=137.44s)]
*  Not just because they highlight inequalities in the city, who can afford them and who can't, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=141.1s)]
*  but also because of concerns that they can interfere with the official response during [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  a fire and use up water by tapping into public hydrants. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=149.5s)]
*  A new Times analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=162.76s)]
*  potentially dangerous drop-off in childhood vaccination rates. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=167.22s)]
*  In the past four years, the percentage of American kindergartners who have complete [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=171.92s)]
*  records of vaccines against measles, polio, whooping cough, and chickenpox has gone down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=176.1s)]
*  Experts say some families are simply missing their records, but a wide variety of religious, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=182.9s)]
*  philosophical, and medical reasons have also been driving down vaccination rates. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=187.5s)]
*  While the overall vaccination rate in the U.S. is still high, there are a growing number [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=192.64s)]
*  of vulnerable pockets across the country, where rates have dropped so low that any new [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=196.98s)]
*  outbreaks of the diseases could become significantly harder to contain. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=202.05999999999997s)]
*  In Idaho, for example, less than 80% of kids are vaccinated against measles, far below [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=206.89999999999998s)]
*  the national average of about 93%. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=212.77999999999997s)]
*  The data also shows a deep partisan divide in the country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=216.22s)]
*  The decline in vaccination rates has been sharpest in states that Donald Trump won in November. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=220.12s)]
*  Republicans are now far more likely than Democrats to consider vaccines dangerous. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=225.68s)]
*  Vaccination rates could continue to plunge as the Trump administration takes office. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=231.48s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=235.84s)]
*  has spent years falsely claiming that vaccines cause autism, along with other misinformation. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=240.84s)]
*  National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan says U.S. officials are putting together the final [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=250.1s)]
*  details of a ceasefire proposal in Gaza for both Israel and Hamas to consider. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=259.68s)]
*  We are very, very close. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=264.96s)]
*  And yet being very close still means we're far because until you actually get across [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=267.56s)]
*  the finish line, we're not there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=271.68s)]
*  For the Biden administration, the pressure is on to help broker the release of at least [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=274.24s)]
*  some of the remaining hostages before Biden leaves office. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=278.64s)]
*  Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone last night about [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=282.9s)]
*  the negotiations, which are underway in Qatar. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=287.34s)]
*  Representatives of Trump's incoming administration are also in the mix. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=290.3s)]
*  His intended Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Netanyahu on Saturday. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=294.56s)]
*  Trump has said, quote, all hell will break out if Hamas doesn't release the hostages [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=299.46s)]
*  by his inauguration a week from today. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=303.38s)]
*  The Times has learned that while some progress has been made in the ceasefire talks, key [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=306.64s)]
*  disagreements remain, including if Israel is willing to fully end the war. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=311.76s)]
*  On Friday, President Biden made a sweeping move on immigration, one of his last big policy [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=325.84s)]
*  efforts before Trump is sworn in. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=331.32s)]
*  He extended temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=333.88000000000005s)]
*  El Salvador, Ukraine and Sudan. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  The designation is intended for people whose countries are too unsafe and in too much upheaval [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  to return to. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=346.5s)]
*  It protects them from being deported. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=348.12s)]
*  They'll be allowed to remain in the U.S. with work permits for another 18 months. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=350.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Trump administration is actively preparing an immigration crackdown. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  In the early days of the pandemic, Trump invoked a public health policy known as Title [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=361.6s)]
*  42 to restrict migration at the U.S.-Mexico border, something Biden temporarily kept in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=365.92s)]
*  place. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=371.48s)]
*  Now, Trump wants to seal the border again, and his advisors have been searching for a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=372.48s)]
*  new health concern to build their case. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=377.0s)]
*  They've looked at whether tuberculosis or other respiratory diseases could justify the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=380.12s)]
*  crackdown. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  They've also considered arguing that migrants could carry unfamiliar diseases, a claim that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  echoes a long-held racist idea that minorities transmit infections. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=390.72s)]
*  An immigration crackdown based on public health concerns, even without a clear threat of disease, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=395.24s)]
*  is just one of many executive orders Trump is expected to sign next Monday, his first [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=401.12s)]
*  day in office. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=405.6s)]
*  And finally, Charles Person, the youngest member of the original Freedom Riders in the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  civil rights movement, has died at 82. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=419.32s)]
*  My grandfather saw me complaining and moaning and groaning about not being accepted and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  being able to go where I wanted to go. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=427.52s)]
*  And he just says to me, you know, you're going to sit there and complain or you're going [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=428.96s)]
*  to do something about it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  Person was a teenager in 1961 when he and 12 others, including future congressman John [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=434.44s)]
*  Lewis, boarded Greyhound buses in Washington, D.C., bound for Birmingham, Alabama. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=439.36s)]
*  They were trying to integrate interstate bus terminals throughout the South. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=445.44s)]
*  Along the ride, he said he used the restroom and the lunch counters designated for white [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=449.58s)]
*  customers drawing stairs. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=453.56s)]
*  By the time they reached Atlanta, Ku Klux Klan members boarded their bus. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=456.16s)]
*  Person was beaten for not sitting in the back. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=461.24s)]
*  And when the bus pulled into Birmingham, more violence broke out engulfing the whole station. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=463.48s)]
*  But the ride inspired others. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=469.2s)]
*  More than 400 riders took similar trips, facing beatings and arrests until President Kennedy's [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  administration ordered the desegregation of all interstate bus terminals. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  Years later, Person talked about his experience on the podcast Book Dreams. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  There are times when you doubt where is humanity. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=487.44s)]
*  But I've learned that there are a lot of good people in this world and you can't be [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=490.32s)]
*  dissuaded by those who want to do harm or who want to deter you from doing normal things [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=494.28s)]
*  like normal people. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=499.15999999999997s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=501.16s)]
*  Today on The Daily, the rise of the MAGA movement in Silicon Valley. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=504.92s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app where you can listen wherever you get your [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhwhyxYbs9s&t=509.88000000000005s)]
