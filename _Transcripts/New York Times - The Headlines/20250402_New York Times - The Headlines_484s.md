# Democrats Get a Boost, and U.S. Admits Deportation 'Error'
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=4.96s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, April 2nd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=7.76s)]
*  The results are in for the state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin that had become a kind of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=19.2s)]
*  temperature check on how voters feel about the Trump administration so far. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=23.64s)]
*  Today, Wisconsinites stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=28.2s)]
*  Our courts are not for sale. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=36.08s)]
*  The liberal candidate Susan Crawford won despite the $25 million that Elon Musk and groups [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  tied to him poured into supporting the conservative candidate. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=45.32s)]
*  Crawford was up roughly 10 points as of early this morning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=49.32s)]
*  For Democratic leaders, the hope is that the local results send a national message that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=52.8s)]
*  voters are fired up to push back against the Trump administration and its efforts to drastically [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  reshape the federal government. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  Also last night, the results came in for two special elections in Florida for House seats. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=65.44s)]
*  Republicans took both as expected, but Democrats cut sharply into their margins. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=71.36s)]
*  In a district where the last GOP candidate won by 33 points, the new representative's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=76.2s)]
*  margin was down to 14. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=81.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  I rise with the intention to stand here until I can stand no longer, until I'm physically [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=88.68s)]
*  unable to stand anymore. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=94.4s)]
*  Senator Cory Booker spoke from the Senate floor for over 24 hours, condemning President Trump [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  in what is now the longest Senate speech on record. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=102.44000000000001s)]
*  He started at 7 p.m. Monday evening. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Have we once held this president to account? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=108.16s)]
*  And he went on through the night and the next day, talking about cuts to health care and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=112.52s)]
*  education and the crackdown on immigration. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  My voice is inadequate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=119.56s)]
*  My efforts today are inadequate to stop what they're trying to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=121.2s)]
*  It was not a filibuster, the tactic where lawmakers hold the floor to try and block [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=126.9s)]
*  a specific piece of legislation, for example. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=131.24s)]
*  But Booker said it was his chance to call on other Americans to stand up to the Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=134.44s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=138.68s)]
*  Booker's speech broke the previous record held by Strom Thurmond, who said it trying [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=139.68s)]
*  to block a civil rights bill in 1957. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=145.52s)]
*  Booker wrapped up at 8.05 p.m. last night, quoting John Lewis, the congressman and icon [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=149.32s)]
*  of the civil rights movement. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=155.0s)]
*  He said for us to go out and cause some good trouble. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=156.68s)]
*  It's getting good trouble. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=163.0s)]
*  I yield the floor. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=165.04s)]
*  The White House dismissed Booker's speech, calling it, quote, a spoof. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=168.24s)]
*  Now three quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=177.84s)]
*  First, he's with his trade and tariff team right now, perfecting it to make sure this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  is a perfect deal for the American people and the American worker. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=186.32s)]
*  Trump will unveil an expansive new set of tariffs today. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=190.48s)]
*  It's unclear exactly what they'll include, but they're likely to hit America's biggest [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  trading partners and be a significant escalation toward a broader trade war that could raise [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=198.44s)]
*  consumer prices and slow the economy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=203.64s)]
*  Trump has said they're necessary to re-energize American manufacturing and stop other countries [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=206.64s)]
*  from, quote, ripping off the U.S. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  Also, the error that you are referring to was a clerical error. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=215.0s)]
*  It was an administrative error. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=218.72s)]
*  The Trump administration admitted this week that it made an administrative error when [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=220.4s)]
*  it deported a man who was living in the U.S. legally to a prison in El Salvador. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=224.32s)]
*  While acknowledging the error, the White House claimed that the man was a convicted gang [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=229.96s)]
*  member, though he never went on trial or pleaded guilty. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=233.8s)]
*  The man's family is pushing to have him returned, but in a court filing, government lawyers [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=237.52s)]
*  say there's nothing they can do to get him back since he's no longer in U.S. custody. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=242.24s)]
*  Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, said her team will seek the death penalty against [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=249.44s)]
*  Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old charged with murdering a UnitedHealth care executive last [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  year. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=259.68s)]
*  The very public killing on a Manhattan sidewalk shocked the country, but also spurred a swell [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=260.8s)]
*  of support for Mangione, who some saw as a vigilante fighting corporate greed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=266.72s)]
*  Bondi's decision is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to revive capital [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=271.92s)]
*  punishment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=277.24s)]
*  President Biden had previously put a moratorium on the death penalty for most federal offenders. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=278.64s)]
*  In Gaza, the United Nations says Israeli forces killed 15 rescue workers as they tried to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  help civilians. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=297.12s)]
*  It's a rare accusation for the U.N. to make. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=298.12s)]
*  The organization has generally been cautious about assigning clear blame. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=301.56s)]
*  According to U.N. officials, last Sunday, an ambulance crew headed out before dawn [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=306.12s)]
*  to help with evacuations. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=310.6s)]
*  They were hit on the way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=312.76s)]
*  Several more ambulances and a fire truck then went out to rescue them, but they went silent [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=314.56s)]
*  too. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=319.0s)]
*  It's an absolute horror. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=320.0s)]
*  What has happened here? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=321.0s)]
*  This should never happen. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=322.0s)]
*  Health care workers should never be attacked again. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=323.0s)]
*  The top U.N. humanitarian official in Gaza, Jonathan Whittle, said it took five days for [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  him and a team to safely reach the site to see what happened. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=330.3s)]
*  He said they found the ambulances, fire truck and a U.N. vehicle crushed and partially buried, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=334.1s)]
*  and they found most of the first responders in their uniforms in a mass grave. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=339.96s)]
*  An Israeli military spokesman claimed that nine of those killed were Palestinian militants [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=344.38s)]
*  and that several vehicles were, quote, advancing suspiciously toward Israeli troops, prompting [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=349.46s)]
*  them to shoot. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=354.16s)]
*  He did not directly say whether the militants were in the emergency vehicles or addressed [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=355.82s)]
*  the full number of those killed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  This morning, Israel announced it will be expanding its military offensive inside Gaza [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=362.5s)]
*  and seizing large portions of the territory after breaking the ceasefire with Hamas last [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=367.42s)]
*  month. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=372.18s)]
*  And finally, the actor Val Kilmer has died at 65. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=378.7s)]
*  The cause was pneumonia, according to his daughter. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=383.1s)]
*  Kilmer rose to fame in the 1980s. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=386.14s)]
*  He played everything from the brooding rock star Jim Morrison to Batman. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=393.5s)]
*  Darkness is as clear as daylight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=399.5s)]
*  In an adaptation that was not widely appreciated. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=402.5s)]
*  While he played plenty of leading men, his career arced toward him being a supporting [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=406.5s)]
*  player, stealing scenes as the bad boy or the bad guy, depending. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=411.18s)]
*  You figured it out yet? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=415.5s)]
*  What's that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=416.5s)]
*  Who's the best pilot? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=417.5s)]
*  In one of his most famous roles in Top Gun, Kilmer was the cool and cocky rival to Tom [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=420.5s)]
*  Cruise. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=425.5s)]
*  Kilmer played that role again in 2022 in Top Gun Maverick, even though a battle with [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=426.5s)]
*  throat cancer had turned his voice thin and raspy. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=432.22s)]
*  The Navy needs Maverick. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=435.5s)]
*  The Top Gun sequel was Kilmer's final performance. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=438.5s)]
*  Thank you, Weiss, for everything. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=442.5s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=449.5s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a Times investigation into the dance group Shen Yun whose performances [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=456.5s)]
*  have been promoted on billboards across the country. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=462.1s)]
*  A look at the group's ties to a Chinese religious movement and its exploitation of young performers. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=464.5s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=471.5s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKM0EtFLFJg&t=475.5s)]
