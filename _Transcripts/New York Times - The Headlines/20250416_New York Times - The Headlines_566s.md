# Deportation Fight Escalates, and America’s New Meth Crisis
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Amelia Nirenberg in for Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=0.0s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, April 16th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=7.44s)]
*  A federal judge is turning up the pressure on the Trump administration in the case of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=14.36s)]
*  the man it wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador. At a hearing yesterday, the judge [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  criticized the administration for dragging its feet and not immediately complying with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  the Supreme Court order to facilitate his release. She said, quote, to date, nothing [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=28.4s)]
*  has been done, nothing. Government lawyers had previously admitted that the man, Kilmar [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=33.1s)]
*  Armando Abrego-Garcia, was mistakenly deported, though on Tuesday, some of President Trump's [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=38.76s)]
*  top advisors abruptly changed their position, claiming that he was deported on purpose. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=44.28s)]
*  The judge is now trying to force the administration to show how it's handling the case behind [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  She said she plans to let Abrego-Garcia's lawyers request government documents and bring [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=55.16s)]
*  in officials for questioning. Meanwhile, the case has sparked anger across the country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=59.81999999999999s)]
*  Are you going to bring a guy back from El Salvador? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=65.56s)]
*  At a town hall in Iowa, constituents confronted Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who heads [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=71.96s)]
*  the Senate committee that oversees immigration policy and federal courts. Grassley said he [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  won't push for Abrego-Garcia's release, arguing that it's out of his control. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=81.58s)]
*  The president of that country is not subject to our U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=85.98s)]
*  Grassley is one of just a handful of Republicans hosting town halls this week while Congress [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=94.98s)]
*  is in recess. In the first months of the Trump administration, the events have become flash [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=98.58s)]
*  points not just about immigration, but about a range of Republican policies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=102.86s)]
*  Many Republicans have gone into sort of hiding and are not engaging as much, if at all, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=107.78s)]
*  with their constituents in unstructured in-person settings. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=116.06s)]
*  Maya Miller, who covers Congress for the Times, was at one of the few other town halls, an [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=121.06s)]
*  event with Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of President Trump's most [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  loyal allies. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=129.5s)]
*  The protest is outside. Thank you very much. The protest is outside. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=130.5s)]
*  She says it quickly became chaotic as protesters interrupted Greene repeatedly. Police used [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=136.54s)]
*  stun guns on two of them and forcibly removed multiple people while supporters of Greene [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=141.78s)]
*  cheered and applauded. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=146.73999999999998s)]
*  At the same time, there were folks there who stayed quiet and kept seated. And afterwards, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=148.54s)]
*  they told me that they didn't feel like their concerns were really heard at all. So if you [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=156.22s)]
*  were a median voter who had genuine concerns that you wanted to bring to your congresswoman, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=162.2s)]
*  this was not a good night for you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  The fight between Harvard and the Trump administration heated up yesterday when President Trump threatened [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=180.56s)]
*  a new attack on the university, stripping the school of its tax-exempt status. Like [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=185.6s)]
*  many schools, Harvard doesn't have to pay taxes for the most part. Trump suggested that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=191.32s)]
*  should change, as his administration tries to force radical overhauls at the university [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=195.72s)]
*  and other top schools. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=200.48s)]
*  The new threat came just after Harvard became the first school to refuse to comply with [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=202.54s)]
*  a list of demands from the administration, and the administration hit back by freezing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=206.62s)]
*  more than $2 billion in federal funding. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=211.2s)]
*  Experts say that it's unlikely that Trump could actually make the IRS take away Harvard's [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=214.6s)]
*  tax-exempt status, and the university is uniquely well-equipped to face off against [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=218.68s)]
*  the White House. It's the richest school in the world, with more than $50 billion in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=223.12s)]
*  its endowment, and spent months preparing for a showdown. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  Still, even an attempt to change its tax status could force the school into a long and expensive [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  legal fight, as the university is starting to feel the pressure from the funding freeze. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  The Times has learned that some public health research has already been halted there, and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=241.52s)]
*  any more cutbacks could hit the 11 hospitals that are affiliated with Harvard. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=245.56s)]
*  Fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=249.52s)]
*  In his first major remarks since leaving the White House, former President Joe Biden gave [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=266.32s)]
*  a speech yesterday condemning the Trump administration and forcefully defending Social Security. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=270.12s)]
*  Well, they're following that old line from tech startups. The quote is, move fast, break [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=275.44s)]
*  things. They're certainly breaking things. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=281.96s)]
*  In Biden's speech, a paid address to disability advocates in Chicago, he said that the Trump [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=285.6s)]
*  administration was, quote, taking a hatchet to the program that more than 70 million Americans [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=290.32s)]
*  rely on. President Trump has promised not to roll back the benefits, but the Social [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=295.72s)]
*  Security administration has said it wants to cut thousands of staffers. And Trump's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=300.7s)]
*  budget cuts have already left many local offices understaffed and overwhelmed with longer lines [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=305.3s)]
*  and longer wait times. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=311.34s)]
*  Biden's speech was one of his relatively few public events since leaving office, though [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=313.62s)]
*  the Times has learned he's expected to do more speaking engagements in the next few [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=317.86s)]
*  months. The former president is also working on a memoir. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=321.62s)]
*  After years of rising overdose deaths, the U.S. got a glimmer of hope last year. Opioid [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  fatalities were falling, treatments were expanding, and drugs like fentanyl seem to be getting [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=336.5s)]
*  less potent. But in some cities, including Portland, Maine, a once popular drug has reemerged [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=341.18s)]
*  with devastating consequences, methamphetamine. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  My colleague Greta Ribas, a photographer and I, spent on and off six months in Portland [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=350.7s)]
*  getting to know people who use the drug and the emergency responders who really struggle [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=357.66s)]
*  to know what to do with someone when they are under extreme agitation from meth. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=363.7s)]
*  My colleague Jan Hoffman covers addiction for the Times. She says that parts of Portland [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=368.7s)]
*  have been overrun by cheap meth, which is now being mass produced by Mexican cartels [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=373.18s)]
*  and is sometimes cut with other dangerous drugs. The result is a stimulant that can [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=378.06s)]
*  lead to psychosis and violent episodes, and it has overwhelmed health officials. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=382.62s)]
*  The neighborhood where much of this is concentrated, called Bayside, has a remarkable repertoire [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=387.58s)]
*  of social services. There are social workers on the street, there are health clinics for [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  people who are unhoused, and yet with all this extraordinary outpouring of services, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=401.32s)]
*  they are baffled by meth. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=408.26s)]
*  One of the emergency responders I spent the most time with was a fellow named Bill Burns, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  who's a mental health specialist with the Portland Police. And he has just been drowning [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=418.5s)]
*  in trying to help people who are under meth influence. He talked about one time putting [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=424.70000000000005s)]
*  his arms around a young guy who was flinging himself against concrete dividers in an alley, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=430.32s)]
*  completely lost to the world. Another time Bill was called to a woman's apartment, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=437.32s)]
*  she was ripping tiles from her ceiling looking for spying devices. And Bill had to try to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=443.24s)]
*  talk her down and also get her to the hospital. This has happened to him and frankly to people [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=448.76s)]
*  under the influence many, many times. It's not at all uncommon. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=453.68s)]
*  Jan says that as meth use surges in places like Portland, health officials are short [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  on tools to help. Unlike with opioids, there are no medications specifically approved to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=462.48s)]
*  treat addiction to meth, and no drugs like Narcan that can be used to reverse an overdose. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=467.36s)]
*  And finally, in Sweden, an annual TV phenomenon is getting underway this week, a live broadcast [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=480.44s)]
*  of the country's moose migration. The country's national broadcaster sets up more than 30 [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=486.68s)]
*  farms and fields along rivers and in forests to capture and stream the migrating moose. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=492.32s)]
*  Last year, millions of people tuned in. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=498.8s)]
*  I make sure I have coffee, I have snacks, I have prepared food so I don't have to be [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=501.76s)]
*  in the kitchen too long. Sleep. Forget it. I don't sleep. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=510.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands of diehard fans like Ola Malmgren flock to a Facebook group as they [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=516.08s)]
*  wait for the huge mammals to lumber across their screens. When one appears, the page [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=521.04s)]
*  blows up in delight. But even when there are no moose on screen, part of the appeal is [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=526.14s)]
*  that it's just nice to have a little window into nature. Unlike other animal programs, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=531.36s)]
*  there is no background music or narration. Arne Nilsson, a moderator of the Facebook [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=536.02s)]
*  group calls it, quote, reality TV at its finest. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=540.56s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, an inside look at the negotiations over the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=547.56s)]
*  future of Iran's nuclear weapons program. That's next in the New York Times audio app, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=551.56s)]
*  or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Amelia Nierenberg. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfbaHa2tZgE&t=556.28s)]
