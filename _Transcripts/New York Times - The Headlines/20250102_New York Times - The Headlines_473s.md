# China Hacks the Treasury Dept., and a Hydropower Crisis
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, December 31st. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=6.36s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=8.56s)]
*  The U.S. Treasury Department says it was hacked by a Chinese intelligence agency, calling [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=14.4s)]
*  it a major cybersecurity incident. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  In a letter to lawmakers yesterday, the department said it learned about the incident earlier [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=21.8s)]
*  this month. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=25.88s)]
*  The hackers were able to get remote access to some employees' computers and unclassified [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=27.08s)]
*  documents. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  It's not clear what they did with that access, but senior U.S. officials tell the Times it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  appears to be an espionage operation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  The Treasury Department keeps sensitive data about global financial systems, including [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=40.16s)]
*  estimates about China's own economy, which has been struggling. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=44.4s)]
*  It also implements sanctions, including against some Chinese firms who are helping Russia [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  in its war against Ukraine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=52.459999999999994s)]
*  Chinese officials have long denied any government role in hacking, but the Treasury breach [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=55.04s)]
*  is the latest in a series of incidents that the U.S. says China is behind. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=59.46s)]
*  In one of the most far-reaching and damaging of those incidents, a Chinese intelligence [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=63.92s)]
*  group hacked into U.S. telecom firms this year, getting access to text messages and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  phone conversations. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=73.08s)]
*  Investigators say phone lines used by Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and others were targeted, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  though it's not clear what, if anything, hackers were able to monitor. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Beyond data collection, there's been a Chinese effort to insert malicious code into U.S. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=82.96s)]
*  utility grids and water supply systems, potentially giving hackers the capability to shut off [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=87.88s)]
*  critical infrastructure. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  The Treasury Department said it's working with the FBI and other investigators to determine [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  the full impact of the latest breach. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Yesterday, a man who had been detained at Guantanamo Bay since the day the U.S. military [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=102.08s)]
*  prison opened was sent home. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=113.52s)]
*  Rida bin Saleh al-Yazidi was captured along with a group of other men on the Afghanistan-Pakistan [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=116.32s)]
*  border in December of 2001. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=121.28s)]
*  Some of them were suspected of being bodyguards for Osama bin Laden. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=124.0s)]
*  Yazidi was sent to Guantanamo Bay the next month and spent almost 23 years there without [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=128.08s)]
*  ever being charged with a crime. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=133.24s)]
*  He was approved for transfer back to his home country of Tunisia more than a decade ago, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=135.74s)]
*  but the deal got caught up in bureaucratic red tape, and Yazidi didn't want to meet with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=140.6s)]
*  other countries that might have taken him in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=144.52s)]
*  His repatriation is part of a final push by the White House to follow through on an Obama-era [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=147.28s)]
*  promise to close Guantanamo. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=152.2s)]
*  It's now clear, though, that that won't happen in this administration. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=155.18s)]
*  There are still 26 detainees left at the prison. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=158.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, a plea deal with the most high-profile remaining prisoner at Guantanamo appears to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=165.66s)]
*  be moving forward. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=170.58s)]
*  Earlier this year, senior Pentagon officials said Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  of the September 11 attacks, would plead guilty to conspiracy and murder charges in exchange [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  for a life sentence instead of a death penalty trial. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=182.1s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense stepped in to try and block the deal, saying he alone should [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=185.66s)]
*  be responsible for that kind of decision. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=189.82s)]
*  But yesterday, an appeals panel at the Pentagon ruled the deal is valid, clearing the way [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=192.38s)]
*  for a guilty plea hearing next week. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=196.98s)]
*  In Ecuador, the country is in the grips of an extreme energy crisis. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=206.7s)]
*  My colleague Julie Turkowitz has been covering the blackouts that have become a near-constant [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=211.7s)]
*  reality. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=216.1s)]
*  The highways are sort of an inky black for long stretches. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=217.1s)]
*  Internet service has gone down because of energy cuts. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  In some places, people don't have running water for seven, eight, nine hours a day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=225.89999999999998s)]
*  Elderly people who live in towering buildings who don't want to get in elevators because [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=232.85999999999999s)]
*  they're scared to be trapped. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=237.82s)]
*  They're just trapped in their homes for days or weeks on end. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=239.38s)]
*  This has really affected almost every aspect of daily life. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=243.62s)]
*  Julie says the problem is that Ecuador went all in on hydroelectric power. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=248.82s)]
*  In the past few decades, it's spent billions of dollars building dams along the rivers [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=253.82s)]
*  that thread through the country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=258.02s)]
*  Hydropower provides 70% of its electricity. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=260.5s)]
*  But the country, along with most of South America, has now been caught in a record-breaking [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=264.06s)]
*  drought, collapsing the whole energy system. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=268.98s)]
*  When Ecuador embarked on this ambitious hydropower expansion project, it really sought to be [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=272.22s)]
*  a leader in becoming not only a country that could sort of build progress through energy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=279.3s)]
*  expansion, but do so using sustainable energy sources. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  And what we've seen is that the country that once tried to respond to climate change has [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  instead become a victim of its own energy system. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=298.54s)]
*  And so now Ecuador is being looked at as a potential warning sign for other countries [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=304.26000000000005s)]
*  around the world that have invested heavily in hydropower. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=309.22s)]
*  Worldwide, more than a billion people live in countries that get the majority of their [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=313.98s)]
*  energy from hydroelectric plants. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=318.66s)]
*  Many of those dams, in places from China to Zambia, have been strained by droughts. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=321.42s)]
*  That's left some countries looking for alternatives, including turning back to fossil fuels to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=326.46s)]
*  keep the power on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=331.62s)]
*  And finally, The Times has an annual tradition of making food predictions. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=340.26s)]
*  What will be the big foods and food trends in the new year? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  Reporter Kim Severson has been digging through food companies' research, talking with chefs [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  and restaurant groups and analysts about what we'll be eating in 2025. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=352.82s)]
*  She says convenience stores and gas station options are going to get some culinary love. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=357.86s)]
*  Social media reviewers are already all over it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=364.14s)]
*  I don't know that I've ever seen meatballs at a gas station before. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=366.62s)]
*  Honestly, not bad. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=369.46000000000004s)]
*  It didn't really taste like garlic or Parmesan, but it kind of had a flame broiled taste to it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=370.82s)]
*  And it was so juicy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=374.66s)]
*  Mini-marts have been cooking up made to order meals. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=375.94s)]
*  And the Japanese parent company of 7-Eleven plans to start bringing over more options [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=378.97999999999996s)]
*  like ramen and egg salad sandwiches that are common at Japanese convenience stores. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=383.26s)]
*  Here is how to pack your oats with protein without any protein powder. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  Also in 2025, Kim says protein is going to continue to be a big buzzword, partly for [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=392.58s)]
*  the gym bros, partly for the people on weight loss medications like Ozempic who need more [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=398.78s)]
*  protein to maintain muscle mass. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=403.28s)]
*  So all hail cottage cheese, peanut butter smoothies, and meat snacks. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=405.58s)]
*  And... [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=410.58s)]
*  These are badger flame beets. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=411.58s)]
*  They're a beet that's bred to be much sweeter and milder than your typical red beet. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=413.34s)]
*  Look out for designer produce. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=418.97999999999996s)]
*  Specially tweaked fruits and veggies, like beets grown to be sweeter, are going to be [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=421.18s)]
*  popping up more often. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  Grapes that taste like cotton candy, strawberries bred to have a tropical twist, etc. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=427.46s)]
*  You may see influencers on social media hyping up the latest berry. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=433.14000000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=437.70000000000005s)]
*  It tastes like candy. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=438.70000000000005s)]
*  So sweet. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=441.5s)]

*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=450.62s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a special year-end episode looking at the best books of the year and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=451.62s)]

*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkluKRwnPxQ&t=463.18s)]
