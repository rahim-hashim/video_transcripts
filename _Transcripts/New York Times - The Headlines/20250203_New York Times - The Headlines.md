# Trump's Trade War Heats Up, and Government Websites Go Dark
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=4.96s)]
*  Today's Monday, February 3rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=7.76s)]
*  The United States and its largest trading partners are now hurtling into a trade war. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=11.6s)]
*  President Trump slapped sweeping tariffs onto Canada, Mexico, and China over the weekend. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=20.32s)]
*  They'll kick in just after midnight tonight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=25.72s)]
*  Products imported from China will face a 10% surcharge, and nearly all products imported [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=28.68s)]
*  through Canada and Mexico will face a 25% surcharge. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=33.8s)]
*  Trump has said that the North American tariffs are intended to force America's neighbors [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=38.68s)]
*  to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl and migrants into the U.S. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=42.84s)]
*  Economists warned that they could ramp up inflation and cripple whole industries. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=47.96s)]
*  Consumers may see prices go up from everything from auto parts to avocados. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=52.36s)]
*  After the tariffs were announced, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went on TV to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  address the American public directly. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=62.92s)]
*  Tariffs against Canada will put your jobs at risk, potentially shutting down American [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=65.72s)]
*  auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=72.52s)]
*  They will raise costs for you, including food at the grocery stores and gas at the pump. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=77.0s)]
*  In a speech, Trudeau announced that Canada will slap its own tariffs on the U.S. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=83.68s)]
*  We don't want to be here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  We didn't ask for this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=90.92s)]
*  But we will not back down. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  What's clear in the case of Canada is that there is a broad consensus to continue with [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  the retaliatory tariffs and other measures against the United States. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=101.48s)]
*  In fact, some top political leaders in Canada are pushing for harsher tariffs faster. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=106.2s)]
*  Matina Stevis-Gridneff covers Canada for the Times. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=112.24s)]
*  She says that beyond the political reaction, there's also been pushback from the Canadian [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=115.36s)]
*  public. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=119.56s)]
*  At pro-sporting events between U.S. and Canadian teams in recent days, Canadians have been [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=125.6s)]
*  booing during the American national anthem. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=130.88s)]
*  And Matina says there's been an immediate push to buy Canadian. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=134.12s)]
*  We have seen stickers with Canadian flags put out on grocer shelves indicating to consumers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=137.92s)]
*  that these are domestically produced goods that should be favored over the American alternatives. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=144.1s)]
*  Mexico has also vowed to retaliate against the U.S. with tariffs, and China's promised [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=151.56s)]
*  its own countermeasures. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=156.72s)]
*  In a post on social media, Trump acknowledged that his aggressive moves could bring some [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  negative consequences, writing, quote, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=163.12s)]
*  In other news from the White House, the Trump administration has revoked immigration protections [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=180.4s)]
*  300,000 people will lose temporary protected status, known as TPS, in the coming months. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  TPS is designed for people from countries racked by conflict or natural disasters. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=190.48s)]
*  In recent years, Venezuelans have faced political repression, runaway inflation, and widespread [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=195.4s)]
*  food shortages. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=200.56s)]
*  But the new Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, says the program is no longer [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=202.48s)]
*  necessary because it does not serve American interests. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=207.32s)]
*  The people who will lose protections will no longer have formal immigration status in [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=211.32s)]
*  the U.S., putting them at risk of being deported. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=215.32s)]
*  Also, in the past few days, a wide range of government websites have gone dark. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=220.32s)]
*  Federal agencies have been scrambling to comply with executive orders targeting diversity [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=226.2s)]
*  programs and what the Trump administration has called gender ideology. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=230.48s)]
*  The agencies had a 5 p.m. deadline on Friday to terminate all of those programs and to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  strip any related language from their sites. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=241.2s)]
*  In the process, the Times found that more than 8,000 websites were shut down. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=244.54s)]
*  That includes Justice Department pages about LGBTQ hate crimes, FDA pages about increasing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=250.24s)]
*  diversity in clinical trials, and thousands of pages from the Census Bureau and the Centers [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  for Disease Control and Prevention. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=261.24s)]
*  The removed pages often mention words like inclusion or transgender. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=263.76s)]
*  It's not clear yet if the pages are permanently gone or if they'll be revised and put back [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  online. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=273.0s)]
*  This morning, salvage teams on the Potomac River will begin lifting the wreckage of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=281.24s)]
*  American Airlines plane that crashed into the water after colliding with a military [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=285.8s)]
*  helicopter last week. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=290.08s)]
*  The crash killed 67 people. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  So far, divers have recovered 55 bodies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  Once the debris is pulled out of the water, it will be moved to a hangar, where it will [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=297.48s)]
*  be examined as part of the ongoing investigation into the crash. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=301.16s)]
*  It's still not clear what exactly led to the collision. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=305.2s)]
*  Researchers now say the plane turned upward in the final moments, perhaps trying to avoid [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=308.92s)]
*  the Black Hawk helicopter, which was flying around 100 feet higher than authorized. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  After the crash, federal authorities have blocked nearly all helicopter traffic along [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=318.32s)]
*  the route that the Black Hawk was flying. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=322.32s)]
*  And finally... [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=336.32s)]
*  Look at that mountain. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=337.32s)]
*  Look at those trees. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  Look at this city getting back up off its knees. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  The Grammy Awards were last night in Los Angeles, a city still reeling from devastating wildfires [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=344.32s)]
*  last month. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=349.92s)]
*  The ceremony was part fundraising effort, with firefighters on stage to present some [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=351.32s)]
*  of the awards, and part pop music celebration. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=355.92s)]
*  God, what have you done? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  Best New Artist went to Chappell Roane, the 26-year-old behind Pink Pony Club and Good [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=362.52s)]
*  Luck Babe. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=367.32s)]
*  It was a triumphant moment for her, since she was once dropped by her label and had [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=368.52s)]
*  to move home and work at a coffee shop to make ends meet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=373.32s)]
*  Because I got signed so young, I got signed as a minor, and when I got dropped, I had [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=376.32s)]
*  zero job experience under my belt. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=382.91999999999996s)]
*  Roane took her moment on stage last night to call out how the music industry treats artists. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=385.52s)]
*  She asked record labels to offer a livable wage and health insurance, especially when [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=391.32s)]
*  people are just starting out. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=396.32s)]
*  Labels, we got you, but do you got us? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=398.12s)]
*  The night's biggest win, though... [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  Cowboy Carter. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  ...was Beyoncé. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=408.32s)]
*  Her album Cowboy Carter, which draws heavily from country music, won Album of the Year. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=409.92s)]
*  I just feel very full and very honored. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=422.32s)]
*  It's been many, many years. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=427.32s)]
*  It was the fifth time Beyoncé had been nominated for the Grammy's Top Award and the first time [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=430.32s)]
*  she won. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=435.32s)]
*  She's the first black woman to win Album of the Year since Lauryn Hill in 1999. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=436.32s)]
*  And I hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=441.32s)]
*  God bless y'all. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=445.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=446.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=447.32s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=449.32s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at how the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek caught Silicon Valley [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=451.32s)]
*  off guard. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=457.32s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=458.32s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=463.32s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkbIIPA0nd0&t=464.32s)]
