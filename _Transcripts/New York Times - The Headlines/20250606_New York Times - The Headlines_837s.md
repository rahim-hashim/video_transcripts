# Musk vs. Trump, a Surge in Whooping Cough, a Friday News Quiz | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, June 6th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=7.92s)]
*  I mean, what we watched unfold was this remarkable break between two of the most powerful men [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=10.92s)]
*  in the world, and it just utterly collapsed. And it didn't just break down, it severed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=18.36s)]
*  My colleague Tyler Pager has been covering how the relationship between President Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=26.04s)]
*  and Elon Musk has erupted into a public feud. Musk, who formally left his special government [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=30.08s)]
*  position last week, has been openly railing against Trump's signature domestic policy [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=36.12s)]
*  bill, criticizing it as disgusting and too expensive. Then, at a press conference in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=41.08s)]
*  the Oval Office yesterday, Trump fired back. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=46.64s)]
*  As anticipated, Trump very early on got a question from a reporter to respond to Elon [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=50.36s)]
*  Musk's criticism of the bill. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=55.6s)]
*  I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  anybody sitting here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=63.36s)]
*  And Trump just sort of started to unload on him. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=64.84s)]
*  And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place. I think he got out there and all of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=68.84s)]
*  a sudden he wasn't in this beautiful Oval Office. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=72.68s)]
*  He said he was very disappointed in him. He said Elon was just self-interested in his [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  criticism of the bill. And he started to sort of walk through a laundry list of complaints [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=81.78s)]
*  about the world's richest man and his former good friend. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  And then from there, that story just continued to unfold. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=91.1s)]
*  Trump went on to claim that he would have won the 2024 election even without the hundreds [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  of millions of dollars Musk poured into his campaign. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=102.06s)]
*  Musk was clearly watching the president's comments and took the fight online. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=105.69999999999999s)]
*  Without me, Trump would have lost, he posted on X. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=110.86s)]
*  That was followed by, quote, such ingratitude. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=114.05999999999999s)]
*  The sparring then gave way to threats. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=117.58s)]
*  Trump posted about how he could save federal money by terminating billions of dollars of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=120.13999999999999s)]
*  government contracts with Musk's companies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=124.78s)]
*  And Musk went scorched earth, claiming that there were references to Trump in government [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=127.61999999999999s)]
*  documents related to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and indicating his support for a [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=132.66s)]
*  post calling for Trump's impeachment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=137.82s)]
*  The thing is, both of these men have a lot at risk. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=140.54s)]
*  For Trump, Elon Musk has promised 100 million dollars for groups controlled by pro-Trump [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  allies ahead of the midterms. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=153.22s)]
*  Elon Musk also controls a powerful platform in X, and he can now deploy that against Trump [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  in a remarkable way. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=163.18s)]
*  For Musk, there are allies of President Trump, including Steve Bannon, who I spoke with on [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=165.17999999999998s)]
*  Thursday, who said Trump should start investigations into Musk. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  So there's a whole host of ways that this could continue to escalate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=176.33999999999997s)]
*  And we'll see what the next twist and turn is. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=180.26s)]
*  Also yesterday, Trump had a 90 minute phone call with the president of China. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=182.62s)]
*  By the way, he invited me to China and I invited him here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=195.5s)]
*  We both accepted. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=198.06s)]
*  So I'll be going there with the first lady at a certain point. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  It was the first known conversation between the leaders since Trump took office and massively [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=203.74s)]
*  escalated the global trade war. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=208.62s)]
*  Countries in both countries have been in limbo, hoping for some kind of resolution. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=211.46s)]
*  At the moment, the tariffs Trump ratcheted up over 100% are on pause, but other trade [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=215.94s)]
*  restrictions between the countries are threatening the global supply chain. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=221.58s)]
*  For example, China stopped exporting rare earth metals, which are crucial to manufacturing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  everything from cars to computer chips. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=230.66s)]
*  Some U.S. factories have already warned they're running out of the stockpiles they had left. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=233.44s)]
*  After the call yesterday, which Chinese officials say Trump requested, the two sides agreed [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=238.42s)]
*  to hold more trade talks, though the Trump administration has said little publicly about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=243.66s)]
*  what concessions it hopes to get from China. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=248.66s)]
*  In the Middle East, officials tell the Times that Israel has been sending weapons into [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=258.86s)]
*  Gaza to arm a Palestinian militia in an effort to fight Hamas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=263.24s)]
*  Facing criticism over the allegations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=268.5s)]
*  government has been working with, quote, clans in the territory. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=272.82s)]
*  Insiders speaking on the condition of anonymity say that weapons and other support have gone [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  to a militia leader named Yasser Abu Shabab, who is believed to command a relatively small [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=281.5s)]
*  group in the city of Ra'afa. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=286.46s)]
*  Abu Shabab became notorious last year amid accusations that he had looted and resold [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  truckloads of humanitarian aid intended for hungry Gazans. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=294.32s)]
*  He disputed that and also calls the claims that he's working with Israel invalid. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=298.8s)]
*  It's not clear what effect arming a Palestinian militia would have on the security situation [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=303.96s)]
*  in Gaza, but Israel's decision offers a window into the government's struggles to find an [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=308.6s)]
*  alternative to Hamas' rule in the territory and its willingness to experiment with potentially [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=313.4s)]
*  risky strategies to do so. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=318.76s)]
*  The Israeli opposition leader has warned it could backfire, writing, quote, the weapons [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=321.4s)]
*  going into Gaza will eventually be pointed at Israeli soldiers and civilians. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=326.21999999999997s)]
*  This year, there has been an unusually high number of whooping cough cases across the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  U.S., more than 10,000, raising the alarm among public health officials. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  Also called pertussis, the respiratory illness is known for causing bouts of coughing so [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=348.66s)]
*  intense that they can lead to vomiting or even broken ribs. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  Experts think the jump in cases is likely due to the falling rate of childhood vaccines [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=358.26000000000005s)]
*  and that people weren't exposed to whooping cough as much during the isolation of the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=363.24s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=367.16s)]
*  That's left people's immune systems out of the habit of defending against it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=368.16s)]
*  My colleague Teddy Rosenbluth on the Times Well Desk has been talking with infectious [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=372.68s)]
*  disease experts who said there are three main categories of people who should consider getting [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=377.06s)]
*  a booster shot. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=382.22s)]
*  So the first situation is if you are a preteen, and that's because the protection you get [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=383.56s)]
*  from the whooping cough vaccines wane over time. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=389.16s)]
*  So by the time you're a preteen, that immunity has really fallen off and you're still attending [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=393.08s)]
*  school, which is a place where pertussis spreads easily. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=397.04s)]
*  Another scenario is if you have a young child in your life that you're planning on seeing, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=401.56s)]
*  whooping cough is bothersome and disruptive for anyone, but it can be potentially deadly [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=406.76s)]
*  for babies, especially under two months. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=412.38s)]
*  So experts said in general, if you're planning on seeing a baby, you should really check [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=415.3s)]
*  to make sure you've had a Tdap booster in the last five years or so. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=419.06s)]
*  And if you can't remember when you've had that booster, it really can't hurt just to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=423.26s)]
*  get the shot again, aside from maybe having a sore arm. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=427.26s)]
*  And then the last scenario is if you are pregnant. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=431.04s)]
*  One of the best ways to protect babies from getting whooping cough is to get vaccinated [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=433.62s)]
*  during your third trimester of pregnancy. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=439.18s)]
*  And so the immunity actually transfers over to the baby and protects them when they are [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=441.54s)]
*  most vulnerable to dying from the infection. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  Teddy says local public health officials may also advise booster shots for anyone living [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=449.3s)]
*  near an active outbreak. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=453.82s)]
*  States on the West Coast, Washington, Oregon and California have reported the most cases [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=456.14s)]
*  this year, according to data from the CDC. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=461.14000000000004s)]
*  And finally, the summer travel season is upon us, and The Times travel desk has been looking [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=464.02000000000004s)]
*  at some of the big trends. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=476.1s)]
*  In some cases, that requires compiling a glossary to keep up. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=477.82s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=481.44s)]
*  One term you might hear this summer, land snorkeling, though there's no actual snorkel [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=482.86s)]
*  required. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=487.94s)]
*  The term refers to going on a walk, maybe in a new place, and really paying attention [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=489.06s)]
*  to all the minute details along the way. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=493.7s)]
*  The same way that you might hover over a coral reef and watch every little tiny fish on a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=496.38s)]
*  snorkeling trip. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=501.3s)]
*  Basically, take it all in. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  Another one, nocturism, as in nocturnal tourism. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=505.1s)]
*  Travel adventures you have at night, whether that's swimming in phosphorescent bays and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=510.18s)]
*  watching the glow, or getting away from city lights to go stargazing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=514.14s)]
*  And forecasters say there's been a jump in interest in after dark tourist activities, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=518.7s)]
*  in some cases to try and beat the heat of the middle of the day. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=523.1400000000001s)]
*  And lastly, some travel organizers say they've seen a rise in phenomenon chasing. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=526.7800000000001s)]
*  People trying to book trips to see natural events like the Northern Lights or solar eclipses. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=531.94s)]

*  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer took the mic at a press conference this week to express [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=612.26s)]

*  I hear something happened while we were at lunch, which led me to say something I didn't [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=618.38s)]

*  Who was Schumer frankly shocked that he agreed with? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=630.42s)]
*  I'll give you a hint. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=634.42s)]
*  It has to do with President Trump's signature policy bill. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=639.02s)]
*  The answer? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=646.78s)]
*  I agree with Elon Musk. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=647.98s)]

*  a nod from the Democrats. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=657.3s)]

*  OK, second question. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=669.14s)]

*  dozens of drones into Russia and launching them at air bases across the country. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=678.5799999999999s)]
*  Eye-witness videos from near one of those bases showed plumes of smoke billowing into [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=683.14s)]
*  the air. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=692.1s)]
*  The whole thing took more than a year to plan, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=693.22s)]
*  Zelensky, and it had a code name. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=697.14s)]
*  What was it called? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=700.34s)]

*  The answer? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=717.6999999999999s)]
*  Operation Spider's Web Ukraine says the attack took out dozens of [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=719.1s)]
*  Russian planes, some of them worth $100 million or more. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=723.14s)]
*  The drones they used to do it cost as little as $600 each. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=727.1s)]
*  And last question. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=734.42s)]
*  This week, Nintendo released its highly anticipated Switch 2, the company's first new console [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=739.78s)]
*  in almost a decade. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=746.3s)]
*  And the ads for it are kind of a nostalgic throwback, featuring a big-name Hollywood [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=747.9399999999999s)]
*  actor who somehow never seems to age. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=752.56s)]
*  That same actor appeared in a Nintendo ad more than 30 years ago when Super Nintendo [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=763.62s)]
*  came out, and that was his acting debut. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=768.42s)]
*  Who is the actor? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=772.3s)]

*  The answer? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=790.3s)]
*  Paul Rudd. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=791.3s)]
*  He had no lines in the 1991 commercial, so he has come a long way. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=792.46s)]
*  As for the Switch 2, Nintendo, like many other companies, has been trying to figure out how [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=797.86s)]
*  increased tariffs will affect the costs. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=802.26s)]
*  It hasn't raised the price of the console itself yet, which is $449, but it did raise [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=805.22s)]
*  the cost of accessories like controllers. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=811.1s)]
*  That's it for the news quiz. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=816.58s)]
*  If you want to tell us how you did, you can always email us at the headlines at ny times [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=817.84s)]
*  dot com. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=822.2s)]
*  The show will be back on Monday, and we'll try a few more questions next Friday. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC_AY-53vPQ&t=823.5400000000001s)]
