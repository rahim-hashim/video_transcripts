# 'Insider Threats' to the Election, and Starbucks’ 4-Minute Goal
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Thursday, October 31st. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=8.52s)]
*  Across the U.S., more than 50 million voters have already cast their ballots. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=14.48s)]
*  The election's mostly been running smoothly, but the country is still on edge. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=19.16s)]
*  Authorities have warned about political violence and foreign powers spreading disinformation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=24.36s)]
*  There are also concerns about how the actual counting of the votes will play out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=29.48s)]
*  One of the concerns that state and local election officials have right now is what they call [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=33.92s)]
*  insider threats. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=38.28s)]
*  These would be people who are kind of well positioned or even running elections offices [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=39.56s)]
*  who would have ability to impact the election based on conspiracy theories. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=44.92s)]
*  Alexandra Berzon covers voting for the Times. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=50.92s)]
*  She says that people steeped in Donald Trump's false claims about rigged elections are now [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=53.900000000000006s)]
*  in some cases in charge of the election process in communities across the country. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=59.4s)]
*  One example of this that came up just this week, in fact, is an incident that's been [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=65.04s)]
*  happening in Michigan in a very small town called Rock River. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=70.0s)]
*  And there you had a clerk and his deputy who have taken over the election systems there. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  And he has decided that they want to do hand counting of ballots, which is an idea that's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=80.1s)]
*  been promoted by a lot of the election denial activist groups that election experts and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=85.04s)]
*  election officials really say could be disruptive to elections because it can slow down the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  process. It's actually not as reliable. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  It's been shown as machines are. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  And the director of elections in Michigan sent a letter earlier this week to the clerks [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  relieving them of their duties in the elections and basically saying that they could not oversee [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  the elections because their plan to do hand counting of ballots, the state says, is not [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=109.84s)]
*  legal in Michigan. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=114.8s)]
*  Alexandra spoke with the clerk who was removed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=116.48s)]
*  He argued that he was protecting the integrity of the election. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=119.2s)]
*  The state of Michigan already had to take over supervision of elections in another town [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=122.84s)]
*  after the Republican clerk there was charged with a felony for his role in trying to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=127.36s)]
*  overturn the results of the 2020 election. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=131.8s)]
*  Alexandra says other people steeped in the false theories have gotten involved this year [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=134.8s)]
*  by volunteering to be poll monitors. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=139.24s)]
*  They're supposed to document disputes and irregularities at the polls. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=142.0s)]
*  But this year, she says many feel their role is to provide proof of Trump's claims of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=145.56s)]
*  fraud. And officials are concerned they could delay or even disrupt vote counts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, President Biden's remarks from a Zoom call earlier this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  week are continuing to haunt Kamala Harris. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Biden appeared to call Trump supporters garbage on the call, though he since said he was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=166.92000000000002s)]
*  actually calling racist rhetoric garbage. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=171.72s)]
*  First of all, I think that the president has explained what he meant. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  But I've said it earlier, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=178.96s)]
*  who they vote for. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=186.84s)]
*  Harris has faced repeated questions about the comments and tried to separate herself [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=188.32s)]
*  from them. The vice president had already been trying to keep her distance from the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=192.44s)]
*  Biden. She did not include him at her Tuesday rally, even though it was just a few [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=196.6s)]
*  hundred yards from the White House. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=201.44s)]
*  Harris campaign officials tell The Times they view Biden as a liability and were concerned [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  about potential gaffes even before his garbage comment. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  For their part, the Trump campaign has been going all in on the soundbite. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=212.48s)]
*  Trump even posed for photos at a Wisconsin campaign stop in a garbage truck. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=216.56s)]
*  Trump has a long history of disparaging comments of his own. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=222.16s)]
*  He's called Democrats vermin, lunatics and the enemy within. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=225.44s)]
*  Just last month, he said Harris was surrounded by terrible people, calling them, quote, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=229.8s)]
*  absolute garbage. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=234.52s)]
*  In eastern Spain, flash floods have wreaked havoc in one of the worst natural disasters [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=244.72s)]
*  to hit the country in years. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=249.68s)]
*  At least 95 people are dead and more are missing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=251.88s)]
*  And the torrential rainfall was off the charts. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=254.96s)]
*  In one town in eastern Valencia, nearly a year's worth of rain fell in just eight hours. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=257.6s)]
*  It washed away homes, bridges and roads. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=263.04s)]
*  And the full scope of the devastation is still unclear. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=265.72s)]
*  I saw tons of cars just abandoned on the highway, on thick layers of mud, that driver [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=268.88s)]
*  that kind of left there to run away from the water. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=276.72s)]
*  Times reporter Emma Bubla is in Valencia, where the storm caught many people unaware. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  All of the people I spoke to had similar stories of just being in their car and slowly [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=285.28s)]
*  seeing water levels climbing up and reaching their legs or their chests, even their [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=289.88s)]
*  chins sometimes. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=296.08s)]
*  I tried to go out to some of the villages that were the hardest hit, but it was very [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=298.08s)]
*  hard to get there because many bridges and roads were either broken or inundated by the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=303.08s)]
*  water. And a lot of these villages are still completely isolated from the rest of the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=308.92s)]
*  country. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=313.72s)]
*  Right now, we aren't always at our best. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=323.72s)]
*  I've heard that while people love Starbucks, some feel like we have drifted from our [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=326.32s)]
*  core. We've made it harder. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  In a call with investors yesterday, the CEO of Starbucks acknowledged the coffee giant [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=331.36s)]
*  has been struggling. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=336.32s)]
*  Starbucks has seen a 10 percent drop in sales in North America in just the past year, as [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=337.88s)]
*  customers have complained about long wait times and the chaotic feeling in stores as they [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=343.16s)]
*  jostle for their drinks. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  We have to make it easier for our customers to get a cup of coffee. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=349.44s)]
*  So in reporting this over the last couple of weeks, I actually went to a number of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=352.44s)]
*  Starbucks and saw the challenges firsthand. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=355.88s)]
*  I think, first of all, they were all slammed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=358.68s)]
*  They had mobile orders that they were shuffling out. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=361.16s)]
*  They had people going through the drive throughs. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  They were just trying to get the orders through. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=366.20000000000005s)]
*  Julie Cresswell is a business reporter at The Times. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  She says Starbucks had been riding a wave in recent years, luring in customers with [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  expanded drive throughs and ever more customizable drinks. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=377.24s)]
*  But the complex orders have bogged down baristas and the focus on to-go orders made the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=381.04s)]
*  stores feel more like frantic Frappuccino factories instead of cozy coffee shops. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, the company's CEO says he's setting a goal of delivering all orders in four [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=391.76s)]
*  minutes or less, and he wants people to enjoy the ambiance again. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=396.68s)]
*  For example, some stores will lean into using ceramic mugs for customers who want to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=401.08s)]
*  linger. But Julie says that for Starbucks, vibes are not the only issue. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  So whereas Starbucks is trying to do hot food, hot drinks, you know, beverages, they [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=410.96s)]
*  want to be a cafe, they want to have mobile orders, they want to have drive through, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=416.24s)]
*  you're seeing competitors in different parts of the country that are just cleaving off [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=419.8s)]
*  sort of one piece of that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=423.44s)]
*  So they're just going to do the only drive throughs and only cold beverages is going [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=425.12s)]
*  to be what they're focusing on and other competitors that are truly just a sit down [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=430.72s)]
*  cafe experience. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=435.4s)]
*  So I think that's one of the more interesting questions around Starbucks is it can it be [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=437.08s)]
*  everything for everyone or is it trying to be too much? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=441.48s)]
*  And finally. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=449.56s)]
*  The Dodgers roared back to beat the New York Yankees last night and win their eighth [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=461.08s)]
*  World Series title. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=465.4s)]
*  For the Los Angeles team, the win validates the massive spending spree it took to pull [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=467.2s)]
*  this team together to get superstar Shohei Otani. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=472.04s)]
*  The Dodgers offered him the largest contract in pro sports history, 700 million dollars [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  over 10 years. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=481.76s)]
*  The last time the Dodgers won the World Series was in 2020, but that came with an [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=483.6s)]
*  asterisk. It was a short season because of the pandemic and covid restrictions meant [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=488.12s)]
*  there was no citywide celebration. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  This year, the Dodgers will get their parade. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  They'll roll through downtown Los Angeles tomorrow morning. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily, a look at how the relationship between black [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=506.36s)]
*  Americans and the Democratic Party is changing through the story of one family in Georgia. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=511.36s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=517.2s)]
*  podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=521.0s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXhlKEWCM0I&t=523.44s)]
