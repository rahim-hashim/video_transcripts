# Trump Pivots Toward Putin, and R.F.K. Jr. Says ‘Nothing’ Is Off Limits
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, February [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=0.0s)]
*  19th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=7.4s)]
*  The Trump administration is going all in on building closer ties with Russia, upending [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=14.08s)]
*  decades of American foreign policy. Yesterday, top U.S. officials, including Secretary of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=19.76s)]
*  State Marco Rubio, met for four hours with Russia's foreign minister as they began [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=25.28s)]
*  peace talks around the war in Ukraine. It was the first face-to-face meeting between [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=30.6s)]
*  Russia and the U.S. since Russia's invasion in 2022. Rubio said that ending the war would [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=35.56s)]
*  open up, quote, extraordinary business and political opportunities for the U.S. and Russia, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  signaling that the administration is ready to look past Russia's brazen land grab and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=47.72s)]
*  its killing of thousands of civilians. Ukraine said it was not invited to the peace talks [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=52.54s)]
*  at all. After the meeting. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=57.3s)]
*  Do you have any message for Ukrainians who, after three years of fighting, might feel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=59.98s)]
*  betrayed or disappointed at not having a seat at these initial talks in Saudi Arabia? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=63.26s)]
*  Trump faced questions about the negotiations at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago. My colleague [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  Jonathan Swan was there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=72.38s)]
*  He was asked about Ukraine not having a seat at the table, and it was a very revealing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=74.06s)]
*  exchange. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=79.1s)]
*  I hear that, you know, they're upset about not having a seat. Well, they've had a seat [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=80.1s)]
*  for three years and a long time before that. This could have been settled very easily. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=83.97999999999999s)]
*  Just a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=88.94s)]
*  President Trump attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=96.1s)]
*  I hate to say it, but he's down at 4% approval rating. And we're a country has been blown [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=99.82s)]
*  to smithereens. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump incorrectly said that he had a 4% approval rating and even seemed to suggest that Zelensky [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  was the one who was responsible for the Russian invasion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  We already knew that Trump felt more warmly toward the Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  than he did toward Zelensky. But it was illuminating to be there at Mar-a-Lago at this moment, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=127.28s)]
*  as his team is negotiating, to see him effectively blame Zelensky for the invasion of his country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=133.56s)]
*  The contempt was stark. Trump didn't say a bad word about Putin. And all of his criticisms [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=141.28s)]
*  seem directed toward Zelensky. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=148.68s)]
*  President Trump's pivot on Putin has raised concerns even among members of his own party. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=152.6s)]
*  And Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi urged caution in an interview on CNN. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=158.4s)]
*  You think that Putin can be trusted in these negotiations? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=162.96s)]
*  No. Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=165.96s)]
*  I've just finished signing some executive orders and if we could start with that, Wil, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  you might want to come up here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=186.12s)]
*  At Mar-a-Lago yesterday, President Trump also signed a new order expanding his power [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=187.12s)]
*  over independent government agencies. The agencies range from the Securities and Exchange [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=192.24s)]
*  Commission to the National Labor Relations Board. They regulate everything from Wall [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=197.32s)]
*  Street to Internet access to unionizing. They're agencies that Congress established. They're [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=201.56s)]
*  designed to be independent and they're structured so their day-to-day activities are not under [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  the direct control of the President. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=212.72s)]
*  These agencies do not get to become a fourth branch of government issuing rules and edicts [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=214.7s)]
*  all by themselves and that's what they've been doing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  When Trump was on the campaign trail, he vowed to change that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=224.17999999999998s)]
*  I will require that they submit any regulations they're considering for White House review. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=227.33999999999997s)]
*  And his new order follows through. It requires the agencies to submit their policies to the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  White House in advance and says the administration can block and cut off funding for initiatives [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  that conflict with the President's priorities. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=243.06s)]
*  Ending the agencies' independence has been a long-time goal of the conservative legal [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=246.1s)]
*  movement which sees this as a way to reduce government regulation and rules on corporations. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  Three more quick updates from Washington. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=260.74s)]
*  On the energy front, the Trump administration is moving to fast-track fossil fuel projects. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=265.06s)]
*  The Army Corps of Engineers has created a new class of emergency permits to speed up [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=271.1s)]
*  the approval of projects like pipelines, mines, and power plants. It's part of President [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=275.94s)]
*  Trump's demand to increase oil, gas, and coal production. The move could limit environmental [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  reviews of the projects and cut out the chance for the public to weigh in. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=287.3s)]
*  At the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. laid out his agenda [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=293.38s)]
*  in his first address to staffers. He vowed to investigate the causes of chronic disease, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=298.14s)]
*  said he would scrutinize childhood vaccines, and prioritize other topics that he said had [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=303.94s)]
*  been considered taboo by mainstream science, saying, quote, nothing is going to be off [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=308.86s)]
*  limits. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=313.94s)]
*  And across the federal government, the Trump administration continues to carry out mass [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=315.94s)]
*  firings. At least 3,000 employees from the U.S. Forest and National Park Services lost [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  their jobs this past week. That includes rangers who maintain trails, clean facilities, and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=326.94s)]
*  conduct search and rescue missions. Some rangers told the Times that the job cuts could make [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=332.42s)]
*  parks and forests less safe for the public. And more firings are planned at multiple other [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  departments, including the Pentagon. Today on The Daily, federal workers on how the cuts [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=344.18s)]
*  have them feeling under attack. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=350.02000000000004s)]
*  The stress is starting to build. Like, jobs really not secure at this point. It's like [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=352.46s)]
*  contraction in my stomach and chest. I started to, like, not be able to eat or sleep. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=357.85999999999996s)]
*  At the Vatican, officials announced that Pope Francis has pneumonia and will remain hospitalized [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=369.7s)]
*  in Rome. The head of the Catholic Church is 88 years old. He went into the hospital last [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=375.94s)]
*  Friday. The Vatican said his condition is, quote, complex, but that he's in good spirits. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=381.54s)]
*  The pope had part of his right lung removed when he was younger, leaving him prone to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=387.54s)]
*  respiratory issues. Over the last few years, he's faced a number of health challenges. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=391.7s)]
*  He's been using a walker or a wheelchair more and more, but he's kept up a busy schedule. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=396.86s)]
*  And finally, astronomers announced yesterday that Earth's chance of being hit by an asteroid [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=404.82s)]
*  is now at its highest level ever recorded. To be clear, that is still very low, but they've [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=415.18s)]
*  got their eye on an asteroid called 2024 YR4, which they just spotted in December. It's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=420.18s)]
*  expected to pass very close to Earth in 2032, on December 22, to be exact, and there's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=427.66s)]
*  a chance 3.1% that it could actually hit the planet. It's smaller than other asteroids [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=433.98s)]
*  that researchers have tracked, somewhere between 130 and 300 feet long, but it could demolish [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  a city with a direct hit. Again, there's a slim chance that could happen, but it's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=446.02s)]
*  a good time to remember that NASA has a program designed for these situations. In the last [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  few years, it ran a test smashing a spacecraft into an asteroid on purpose to see if it [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=455.94s)]
*  could knock it off course, and it was able to minimally alter its path that way. The [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=461.26s)]
*  agency's administrator at the time said the test showed, quote, NASA is serious as a defender [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=466.62s)]
*  of this planet. Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suv0fqh0v-8&t=472.42s)]
