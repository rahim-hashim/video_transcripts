# Trump Defeats Harris to Retake the Presidency
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=4.96s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, November 6th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=8.36s)]
*  Donald Trump has been elected the next president of the United States, defeating Kamala Harris. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=13.72s)]
*  Trump's victories in the crucial battleground states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=22.68s)]
*  and Wisconsin will send him back to the White House. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=27.56s)]
*  Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  There's never been anything like this in this country and maybe beyond. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=36.76s)]
*  And now it's going to reach a new level of importance because we're going to help our [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=42.44s)]
*  country heal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=49.36s)]
*  We're going to help our country heal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=50.36s)]
*  Trump himself claimed victory before many news outlets had called the race. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=51.84s)]
*  Speaking in West Palm Beach, Florida, a little after 2 a.m., he was surrounded by his wife, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=56.12s)]
*  children, campaign staff and prominent supporters, and he credited his win to the wide coalition [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=61.0s)]
*  that voted for him. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=66.6s)]
*  They came from all quarters, union, non-union, African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=67.96s)]
*  Arab-American, Muslim-American. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=75.6s)]
*  We had everybody and it was beautiful. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=79.12s)]
*  It was a historic realignment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=81.72s)]
*  Votes are still being tallied in some states. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=85.4s)]
*  Trump is on track to win not only the Electoral College, but also the popular vote. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=87.92s)]
*  You know, going into election night, we thought that this was going to be close. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=93.12s)]
*  We thought this would be a race that would stretch on for days and not weeks before we [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=96.4s)]
*  knew the outcome. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  But Trump scored victory after victory and he kept winning by fairly decisive margins. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=101.68s)]
*  Adam Nagourney covers politics for the Times. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  So Donald Trump is the first president in over 100 years to retake the White House after [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=109.96s)]
*  having lost. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  And what is more remarkable about this is he left the White House in such disrepute. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  I mean, he was impeached twice. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=122.44s)]
*  Republicans were saying his career was over. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=125.36s)]
*  No one could imagine him coming back. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=127.6s)]
*  And in the interim, since he left office, he had been indicted and convicted of multiple [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=129.4s)]
*  felonies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=134.24s)]
*  So the idea that he could return to the White House after all that history is just remarkable. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=135.32s)]
*  And his appearance early this morning, sort of declaring victory, JD Vance came out to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=140.72s)]
*  speak for a few minutes and he goes, I think we just witnessed the greatest political comeback [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=145.88s)]
*  in the history of the United States. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=150.84s)]
*  And I don't think that's hyperbole. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=152.76s)]
*  I think that really is what we saw. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=154.64s)]
*  Looking ahead to what will be Trump's second term starting in January, there's a lot of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=159.28s)]
*  things that he talked about during the campaign. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=163.92s)]
*  He talked about imposing massive tariffs. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  He talked about doing a major deportation of what he would call illegal immigrants. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=169.4s)]
*  I think he's coming in with a very clear agenda and I would expect him to begin doing a lot [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=174.2s)]
*  of the stuff that he talked about. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=177.72s)]
*  Also last night, Republicans seized control of the Senate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=182.92s)]
*  They picked up at least two Democratic seats. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=186.44s)]
*  In West Virginia, the state's Republican governor, Jim Justice, won the seat formerly held by [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=189.48s)]
*  Joe Manchin and in Ohio, Bernie Marino ousted Sherrod Brown. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=193.76s)]
*  Republican incumbents also fended off Democratic challengers in some tight races, including [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=199.12s)]
*  in Texas where Ted Cruz held onto his seat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=204.16s)]
*  The Republican victories end four years of Democratic control in the Senate. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  In the House, control is still up for grabs. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=212.51999999999998s)]
*  Many of the most competitive House races have yet to be called. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=215.32s)]
*  Running those votes, especially in California, may take days. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=218.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, measures to protect abortion rights were on the ballot in 10 states last night [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=223.96s)]
*  and they passed in most of them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  But in Florida, South Dakota, and Nebraska, efforts to ensure access to the procedure [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=235.84s)]
*  failed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=241.24s)]
*  The results end what had been an unbroken winning streak for abortion rights ballot measures [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  since Roe v. Wade was overturned. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=248.04s)]
*  In all, Election Day went smoothly across much of the country. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=251.64s)]
*  There had been widespread concerns about interference and disruption, and there were bomb threats [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=255.36s)]
*  called in at polling stations in multiple states. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=260.4s)]
*  But they did not prevent people from casting ballots, and election officials described [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=263.44s)]
*  the process as generally calm, safe, and secure. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=267.44s)]
*  Here's what else we're covering. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=275.84s)]
*  In Israel yesterday, there was a shakeup at the highest levels of the government. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=280.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister, Yoav Galant, after the two [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=284.28s)]
*  repeatedly clashed over the strategy in Gaza. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=289.26s)]
*  Galant, who'd been pushing for a ceasefire, was seen as a moderate voice on the conflict, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=291.88s)]
*  and he'd called Netanyahu's goal of achieving total victory over Hamas nonsense. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=297.28s)]
*  The announcement sparked protests across Israel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=302.72s)]
*  Large crowds blocked traffic and lit bonfires on a major highway in Tel Aviv. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=306.0s)]
*  Netanyahu has already named Galant's replacement Israel Katz, the country's foreign minister, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=311.48s)]
*  who's a close ally of Netanyahu's and is unlikely to challenge him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  And in other news, the Times has learned that North Korean troops are now actively fighting [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=322.0s)]
*  alongside Russia in its war on Ukraine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=326.48s)]
*  The North Koreans clashed with Ukrainian soldiers in the sliver of Russia that Ukraine has occupied [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=329.84s)]
*  in recent months. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=335.08s)]
*  A significant number of North Korean troops were killed, according to one U.S. official. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=336.48s)]
*  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the clashes mark a, quote, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=341.6s)]
*  new chapter of global instability. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=345.48s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=348.0s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Times political reporters Astead Herndon, Lisa Lair, and Nate Cohn [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=360.72s)]
*  break down last night's results. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=365.76s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=368.44s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=373.36s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aukflT2zB2U&t=374.36s)]
