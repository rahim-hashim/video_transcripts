# Gaza Fighting to Pause for Polio Vaccinations, and Harris’s CNN Interview
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Friday, August 30th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=8.24s)]
*  Can you hear me loud and clear? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=14.4s)]
*  Perfectly. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=16.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, greetings from Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=17.0s)]
*  I want to update you first on the polio campaign. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=20.88s)]
*  In Gaza, the World Health Organization is trying to stop an outbreak of polio. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=25.44s)]
*  The top official with the group announced they've reached a deal with Israel to pause [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=30.76s)]
*  military operations there for a brief window to try and vaccinate as many children as possible. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  Starting on Sunday, the military has agreed to suspend its offensive in central Gaza from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=41.0s)]
*  6 a.m. to 3 p.m. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=45.88s)]
*  They'll repeat that schedule for three days, and there will be pauses in different parts [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=48.32s)]
*  of the territory later on, as health workers try to vaccinate some 650,000 kids. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=52.08s)]
*  This is a way forward. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=58.52s)]
*  I'm not going to say this is the ideal way forward, but not doing anything would be really [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=60.6s)]
*  bad. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=65.84s)]
*  We have to stop this transmission in Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=66.84s)]
*  Global health authorities have been pushing for an emergency vaccination campaign after [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=70.32s)]
*  polio was found in the wastewater in Gaza last month, and a young child was later diagnosed. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=74.36s)]
*  The first confirmed case of polio in the area in 25 years. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=80.6s)]
*  The disease has been nearly eradicated in most of the world, but the 10-month-long war [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=85.33999999999999s)]
*  has devastated the health services in Gaza, and aid officials say that the severely unsanitary [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=90.33999999999999s)]
*  conditions there have allowed even rare diseases to spread. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=96.24s)]
*  Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for sitting down with me. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris gave the first major interview of her presidential campaign yesterday, sitting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=114.36s)]
*  down with CNN's Dana Bash. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=118.88s)]
*  The voters are really eager to hear what your plans are. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  If you are elected, what would you do on day one in the White House? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=123.88s)]
*  Well, there are a number of things. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=128.24s)]
*  I will tell you, first and foremost, one of my highest priorities is to do what we can [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  to support and strengthen the middle class. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=136.56s)]
*  The interview was a high-stakes moment for Harris, who voters have really only seen give [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  scripted speeches rather than off-the-cuff answers since she jumped into the race last [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=145.44s)]
*  month. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  She was joined by her running mate Tim Walz, though he pretty much took the backseat, as [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  Harris was pressed to lay out specifics of her policy plan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=156.04s)]
*  So what would you do day one? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  Day one, it's going to be about, one, implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=161.56s)]
*  I've already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we're going [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=166.76s)]
*  to do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, what we're going to do to invest in America's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=171.24s)]
*  small businesses. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=175.8s)]
*  Kamala Harris, in her CNN interview on Thursday night, took great pains to not put any daylight [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=176.8s)]
*  between President Biden's policy legacy in office and what she would do if elected to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=184.04s)]
*  a term in her own right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=189.64s)]
*  Times political reporter Reid Epstein is covering Harris's campaign. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=191.48s)]
*  She embraced his economic record, his stance toward Israel and Gaza, his position on the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=195.28s)]
*  border, and even on fracking in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=201.2s)]
*  Anything that Mr. Biden is for, she essentially said that she is for too. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=207.62s)]
*  I'm very proud of the work that we have done that has brought inflation down to less than [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  three percent, the work that we have done to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=215.8s)]
*  for seniors. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=220.48s)]
*  These are themes that we can expect Harris to come back to again and again over the final [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=221.48s)]
*  weeks of the campaign, and particularly in the days leading up to the September 10th [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=226.48s)]
*  debate with Donald Trump. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=231.2s)]
*  She's essentially going to argue that people can have the parts that they might have liked [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=233.28s)]
*  about the Biden years, his policies, without the parts of the Biden years that they didn't [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  like, primarily the president himself. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=244.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, Donald Trump is trying to reposition himself with voters on a key issue in this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=247.04s)]
*  year's presidential race, reproductive health. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=255.2s)]
*  I'm announcing today in a major statement that under the Trump administration, your [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  government will pay for or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for all costs [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=263.56s)]
*  associated with IVF treatment, fertilization for women. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=272.28s)]
*  At a rally in Michigan, he floated a new proposal that would mandate total coverage for in vitro [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=278.23999999999995s)]
*  fertilization treatments, though he didn't say how that would be paid for. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  One cycle of IVF can cost $20,000 or more. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=287.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, if you talk to them, they'll say, oh, he really doesn't like, they have ads, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=291.32s)]
*  like I'm against it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  It's just the opposite. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  Trump also suggested yesterday that he might support a ballot measure that would expand [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=297.52s)]
*  abortion rights in his home state of Florida, though his campaign quickly tried to downplay [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=301.96s)]
*  that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=306.4s)]
*  Previously, Trump has bragged about appointing the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=307.4s)]
*  Roe v. Wade. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=312.4s)]
*  But his new messaging seems to be part of a pattern of trying to appeal to women voters. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=314.24s)]
*  Recent polling suggests Harris has made big gains with women voters in battleground states. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=319.88s)]
*  In nearly every state in the country right now, COVID levels are at high or very high [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=330.56s)]
*  levels, according to the CDC. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=335.6s)]
*  Hospitalizations are up. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=339.2s)]
*  600 people a week are dying from the virus. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=340.2s)]
*  And the surge is hitting just as kids are packing back into classrooms and millions [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=343.6s)]
*  of Americans are getting together for Labor Day weekend. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=348.2s)]
*  But this is also the country's fifth summer of COVID. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=351.54s)]
*  And Emily Baumgartner, the Times National Health correspondent, has found that many [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=354.8s)]
*  people are taking the virus less seriously than ever before. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=358.54s)]
*  I've been talking to people about how they're living with the virus and what their life [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=362.1s)]
*  looks like now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=365.74s)]
*  And I've just come across this collective psychology of people who are ready to move [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  on. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=371.38s)]
*  Emily has been covering COVID since 2020. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=372.38s)]
*  People who used to mask everywhere they went and always have a mask in their pocket don't [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=375.18s)]
*  even own any masks anymore. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=379.54s)]
*  A lot of people who used to test before going out to a social event or after traveling and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=381.38s)]
*  now people avoiding tests because they don't want to know whether they have the virus. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=386.98s)]
*  They don't want to have to change their plans. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  One reason that the culture of COVID has changed so much is because this is a virus that still [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=393.58000000000004s)]
*  evades our understanding, even epidemiologists understanding. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=399.94s)]
*  These variants are evolving faster than the flu. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  And so there's really no predictability. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=406.54s)]
*  These surges come at different times throughout the year, every time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=408.6s)]
*  And another reason is that people have become extremely confused. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  One person I spoke to said that he would test if he felt that he was supposed to, but [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=416.22s)]
*  he couldn't even keep track of what the CDC recommendations were anymore. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=420.26000000000005s)]
*  At this point, the CDC has started recommending that people deal with COVID the same way they [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  deal with the flu and the same way they deal with RSV. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=430.1s)]
*  They recommend if you have a fever, stay at home for 24 hours after the fever is gone, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=432.94000000000005s)]
*  make sure your symptoms are improving. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=438.3s)]
*  And then when you go back out in public, make sure you wear a mask and protect others. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  There's really no specific COVID guidance anymore. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=444.16s)]
*  And on some level, there's also a bit of a callousness that's developed culturally. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=447.04s)]
*  A lot of epidemiologists say that even though 600 deaths a week is really heartbreaking, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=451.32s)]
*  when you compare that to what we were seeing at the peak of the pandemic, when you compare [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=456.64s)]
*  that to 20,000 deaths a week, it's something that we seem to just have decided as a society [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=460.2s)]
*  that we are collectively willing to live with. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=465.62s)]
*  And finally, cruise ships are getting bigger, a lot bigger. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=467.84s)]
*  The world's largest cruise ship ever, the Icon of the Seas, launched earlier this year, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=477.96s)]
*  capable of carrying nearly 8,000 people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  It weighs over a quarter million tons, and it's so big that they've divided it up into [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=486.73999999999995s)]
*  eight quote unquote neighborhoods. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=491.02s)]
*  There's been so much demand for cruises that now Royal Caribbean announced it's adding [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=494.68s)]
*  more mega ships, with at least four more on order. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=499.28s)]
*  Other cruise companies are also eyeing big, big, big expansions. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=503.04s)]
*  The massive scale has raised concerns about the environmental impact of the ships. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=507.64s)]
*  A report from an environmental advocacy group found the world's largest cruise ships are [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=512.28s)]
*  now twice as big as they were 20 years ago. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYr53iecQc&t=517.4399999999999s)]
