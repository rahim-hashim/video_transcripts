# Israel Steps Up West Bank Raids, and Trump’s Arlington Incident
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=5.04s)]
*  Today's Thursday, August 29th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=6.04s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=8.6s)]
*  Israel's wide-scale raid in the West Bank this week appears to be the largest in over [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=14.4s)]
*  a year. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=19.0s)]
*  Hundreds of troops went into the occupied territory, targeting what the Israeli military [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=20.68s)]
*  said are militant strongholds. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=24.86s)]
*  In many past raids, Israel has gone into these places and left within a number of hours, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=27.32s)]
*  but we're now speaking more than 24 hours since the start of this raid, and the Israeli [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  forces are still on the ground. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=39.96s)]
*  Adam Raskon covers Israel for the Times. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=42.24s)]
*  He says that while much of the focus in the last year has been on Gaza, Israel has also [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=45.0s)]
*  been conducting near-daily raids in the West Bank. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=49.6s)]
*  Thousands of Palestinians there have been killed, and thousands have been arrested on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=53.68s)]
*  suspicion of being involved with armed groups. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=57.3s)]
*  Israel sees this as an operation focused on rooting out militancy in parts of the West [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=60.64s)]
*  Bank, whereas much of the Palestinian population sees it as a raid that's upending their lives [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=67.52s)]
*  and forcing them to huddle in their homes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  We spoke to many people on the ground, and they spoke about hunkering down in their homes, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=79.0s)]
*  fears of snipers on roofs nearby. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=86.96s)]
*  These individuals that we spoke to hadn't been outside for the entirety of the day yesterday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=90.56s)]
*  An Israeli military spokesman said yesterday that the operation in the West Bank is in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=98.28s)]
*  its quote, first stages. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=102.56s)]
*  So far, it's been concentrated in the cities of Jenin and Tolcarum. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=105.1s)]
*  Israeli officials claim that more than 150 attacks against Israelis have originated from [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=109.02s)]
*  those areas in the past year. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=113.78s)]
*  The family of a military veteran buried at Arlington National Cemetery has expressed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=121.06s)]
*  concern that Donald Trump's campaign filmed footage at his grave without permission. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=125.58s)]
*  Trump visited the cemetery in Virginia on Monday for a wreath-laying ceremony honoring [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=131.5s)]
*  American troops killed in a bombing in Afghanistan in 2021. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=136.3s)]
*  The family of a Marine killed in that incident granted permission to film and take photos, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=140.86s)]
*  but the family of a veteran buried next to him, Master Sergeant Andrew Marquesano, did not. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=146.34s)]
*  Photos and videos of Trump's visit to the graves were published to Trump's TikTok account [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=152.58s)]
*  including a photo of Trump giving a thumbs up to the camera with Marquesano's grave clearly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=157.34s)]
*  visible a few feet away. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=163.18s)]
*  Marquesano's sister told the Times she supports the family of the Marine who did grant permission, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  but said the cemetery told her Trump campaign staffers did not adhere to Arlington's rules. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  According to Arlington officials, filming and taking photos at the graves for political [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=177.58s)]
*  purposes violates federal law. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=182.06s)]
*  A cemetery employee tried to stop Trump's team from taking photos and clashed with his [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=185.54s)]
*  staffers, according to three military officials. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=189.98s)]
*  Members of Trump's campaign later publicly insulted the employee, calling her a despicable [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=193.5s)]
*  individual. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=198.7s)]
*  She's declined to press charges related to the altercation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=199.7s)]
*  Military officials say it's because she's worried about retaliation from Trump's supporters. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  It's unclear if the Department of Defense will pursue a legal claim related to the photos. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=208.73999999999998s)]
*  Tonight, Kamala Harris will give her first major interview since starting her campaign [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=215.54s)]
*  for the presidency. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=223.18s)]
*  It'll be a joint appearance with her running mate, Tim Walz. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=224.18s)]
*  The question of if and when she'd do an interview has been hanging over her campaign. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  She hasn't really interacted with reporters in unscripted settings since jumping into [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=233.42s)]
*  the race last month. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  And her critics, especially Trump, have repeatedly asked why she hasn't opened herself up to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=239.76s)]
*  The interview will be taped this afternoon and air on CNN at 9 p.m. Eastern. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=245.74s)]
*  President Biden's plan to wipe out student loan debt for millions of Americans hit another [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  roadblock yesterday when the Supreme Court upheld a temporary pause on the SAVE program. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=259.86s)]
*  The program is one of the newer piecemeal efforts by the Biden administration to forgive [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=266.54s)]
*  student loans after his initial broad push to cancel $400 billion in debt was struck [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=270.54s)]
*  down by the court last year. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=277.1s)]
*  SAVE would have cut required monthly payments in half for many borrowers and offered a faster [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=279.94s)]
*  path to erase some of the debt completely. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  But a group of Republican-led states have been trying to block the effort, arguing that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=288.5s)]
*  the plan is too expensive and that it should have been approved by Congress. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=292.94s)]
*  For now, the eight million borrowers enrolled in SAVE will stay in limbo. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=297.42s)]
*  Their repayments have been paused and they're not being charged interest while the fight [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=302.38s)]
*  over the program continues in court. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=306.24s)]
*  Yesterday in California, lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a new law regulating artificial intelligence. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=313.42s)]
*  Since many of the biggest AI companies are based in the state, the legislation could [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=320.38s)]
*  effectively set a national standard for regulating the technology. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=324.56s)]
*  Among other requirements, the bill mandates safety testing of AI tech before it can be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=329.44s)]
*  released to the public, requires companies to have a way to quickly shut down a system [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=334.36s)]
*  like an off switch, and lets the state sue companies if their tech causes serious harm [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=339.64s)]
*  like mass property damage or death. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=345.8s)]
*  The bill has created warring camps of those who support it and those who oppose it. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=348.88s)]
*  Cecilia Kang covers AI policy for the Times and has been reporting on the intense disagreements [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=353.52s)]
*  in the state about whether the bill should be signed into law. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=359.24s)]
*  Those who support it include technology leaders like Elon Musk, as well as civil society groups [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=363.12s)]
*  and academics such as Jeffrey Hinton, who is known as one of the godfathers of AI. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=369.84s)]
*  They say that the technology is so dangerous and potentially has the ability to cause so [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  much harm that regulators need to step up now and create guardrails for the technology. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=381.32s)]
*  Then you have those who oppose it, which include companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google, who [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=388.04s)]
*  say it's way too early in the progress of artificial intelligence to try to put straps [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=393.76s)]
*  of regulation on how the technology is created and that creating such regulations can impede [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=400.38s)]
*  innovation and also really deter and hurt the US's lead on the development of artificial [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=408.56s)]
*  intelligence globally. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=416.04s)]
*  Now all of these parties are trying to pressure the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=418.16s)]
*  to either sign it or veto it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=423.6s)]
*  He has a month to do so and he has so far not shown his hand. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=425.9s)]
*  And finally, the night sky in Paris, France, approaching midnight there lit up with the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=436.5s)]
*  cauldron once again. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=445.14s)]
*  Today in France, the 2024 Paralympic Games kick off. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=447.54s)]
*  More than 4,000 athletes are set to compete in front of the Eiffel Tower, Versailles, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=451.94s)]
*  and other iconic sites that were the backdrop of the Olympic Games earlier this summer. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=456.78s)]
*  The Paralympic competitions started in Rome in 1960. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=462.18s)]
*  Athletes are sorted according to how much their disabilities affect their performance. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=466.84000000000003s)]
*  They then compete against others in their same category. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=471.18s)]
*  This year there will be 22 individual and team sports. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=474.82s)]
*  There's wheelchair tennis, paraswimming, and blind football. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=478.74s)]
*  Americans would call it blind soccer. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=483.06s)]
*  The players rely entirely on their hearing and fans are asked to stay completely quiet [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=485.06s)]
*  so the athletes can detect the sound of the ball as it moves around the field. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=490.68s)]
*  There are also Paralympic events that don't have an equivalent in the Olympics, like boccia, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=495.74s)]
*  a relative of the lawn bowling game bocce. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  According to the reigning men's champion of the sport, boccia is, quote, tactical, aggressive, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=504.29999999999995s)]
*  and cutthroat. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=509.64s)]
*  The Paralympic Games will run until September 8th. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=511.44s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=516.54s)]
*  Today on The Daily, if you feel like you are being asked to leave a tip more than ever before, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=517.76s)]
*  you are right. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=523.6s)]
*  The story of how tipping took over. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=524.88s)]
*  You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=527.88s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=531.72s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4wQNoYC0o8&t=532.72s)]
