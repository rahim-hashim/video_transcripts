# Wildfires Roars Through L.A., and Trump Floats U.S. Expansion
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=0.0s)]
*  8th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I'm just south of the Pacific Palisades where the fires are burning right now. And I'm [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=16.16s)]
*  right on the evacuation route where people are trying to get out of this region. And [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=20.96s)]
*  I can just look down the street here and see dozens and dozens and dozens of cars full [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=24.28s)]
*  of people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  My colleague Emily Baumgartner is in Los Angeles where a fast moving wildfire is tearing through [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=33.64s)]
*  the Pacific Palisades, destroying homes and forcing at least 30,000 people to evacuate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=38.52s)]
*  The area is a wealthy neighborhood along the coast full of windy dead end roads and people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  trying to flee have been caught in stalled traffic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=49.44s)]
*  These cars are packed with their children, their pets sitting on their laps. I saw several [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=52.36s)]
*  people just sort of running across the street toward their cars, stuffing possessions into [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=56.76s)]
*  the trunks, stuffing food and water into the trunks, just trying to get out of this [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=61.36s)]
*  area as quickly as they can. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=65.8s)]
*  The fire has shocked officials with its speed and its spread. It's been fed by powerful [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=67.76s)]
*  winds that grew stronger overnight and are expected to continue through this morning. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=72.48s)]
*  The only sounds that we can hear out here on the scene are just these rushes of wind. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=77.04s)]
*  It is absolutely screaming loud when the wind comes through and the sound of palm fronds [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  that are crashing down from the palm trees so loud it sounds like an explosion. And these [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  sounds, the sounds of the wind and the effects of the wind are really what sort of epitomizes [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=93.44s)]
*  this particular fire because the wind is the reason that no one really knows where this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=99.56s)]
*  is going to go next and what makes it so unpredictable and so frightening for so many residents. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=104.16s)]
*  All night, alerts have been going out to residents in neighboring areas that may soon be in the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=111.24s)]
*  fire's path. Just after midnight, the city of Malibu said everyone there should be prepared [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=115.92s)]
*  to leave. A city council member sent a message saying, quote, The Palisades Fire is a monster. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=121.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the opposite side of Los Angeles County in the east, a separate wildfire, this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=127.72s)]
*  one just above Pasadena, is also burning out of control, forcing evacuations there. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=133.72s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people have lost power in the region. As of early this morning, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=139.16s)]
*  no deaths have been reported, but officials have warned that the full impact of the fires [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=143.76s)]
*  won't be clear until they're contained. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=148.26s)]
*  I'm just telling you, this will be the golden age of America. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=156.2s)]
*  This is the golden age of America. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=159.32s)]
*  We're going to have a great country again. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=161.12s)]
*  At Mar-a-Lago yesterday, Donald Trump held a rambling hour-long press conference that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  included conspiracy theories and a long list of grievances. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=168.04s)]
*  He veered from complaints about water pressure in household appliances. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=175.88s)]
*  To a vague promise to ban new wind energy projects. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=183.6s)]
*  He said the Gulf of Mexico should be renamed the Gulf of America. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  But his most striking comments were his threats to add territory to the United States. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=191.44s)]
*  Well, we need Greenland for national security purposes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=197.04s)]
*  I've been told that for a long time, long before. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=200.4s)]
*  He repeated a plan to push Denmark to sell Greenland, saying that Chinese and Russian [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=202.92s)]
*  ships have been appearing around the polar island. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=207.88s)]
*  He doubled down on his statements calling for Canada to become the 51st U.S. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=210.84s)]
*  state. And he also made the case for the U.S. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=215.2s)]
*  taking back control of the Panama Canal, which the U.S. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=217.96s)]
*  handed over to Panama in the 70s. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=221.56s)]
*  Trump claimed that China is currently running the canal, which is not true. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Can you assure the world that as you try to get control of these areas, you are not [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=227.8s)]
*  going to use military or economic coercion? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=235.32s)]
*  No. When pressed by reporters, Trump refused to rule out taking Greenland and the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=238.28s)]
*  Panama Canal by force. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to commit to that now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=245.52s)]
*  It might be that you'll have to do something. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  Look, it's not clear if Trump intends to follow through on these threats or if it's [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  just a negotiating tactic. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  After the press conference, world leaders pushed back forcefully. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=256.32s)]
*  The prime minister of Greenland said Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=259.91999999999996s)]
*  Panama's foreign minister said it would never turn over control of the canal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=264.47999999999996s)]
*  And Canada's outgoing prime minister, Justin Trudeau, posted on social media, quote, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=268.44s)]
*  There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=273.12s)]
*  States. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=277.16s)]
*  Hey, everyone, I want to talk about something important today because it's time to get [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=287.92s)]
*  back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=292.0s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Metta, announced yesterday that the company is ending its [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=295.88s)]
*  fact checking program that monitors posts on its social media platforms. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=300.8s)]
*  The company launched the multibillion dollar effort after the 2016 election and Facebook [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=305.84s)]
*  came under fire for allowing misinformation to spread unchecked. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  Multiple studies showed that Facebook's fact checks were effective at reducing the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=314.8s)]
*  spread of false information. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=319.28s)]
*  But in a video posted online, Zuckerberg claimed that ultimately the fact checkers [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=321.2s)]
*  were too politically biased. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=325.48s)]
*  What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=327.55999999999995s)]
*  down opinions and shut out people with different ideas. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=332.11999999999995s)]
*  And it's gone too far. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=335.23999999999995s)]
*  Zuckerberg's announcement seems to be the latest example of his company aligning itself [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  with the incoming Trump administration. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=340.96s)]
*  The president-elect has long claimed that social media platforms have censored [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  conservative voices. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  Even if they accidentally censor just one percent of posts, that's millions of people. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  And we've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  The end of the fact checking program will affect what billions of people see online. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  And misinformation researchers called the policy change deeply concerning, saying it [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=363.4s)]
*  could open the floodgates for hateful content, misleading posts and conspiracy theories. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=368.2s)]
*  Zuckerberg himself acknowledged that it will be a trade off. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=373.96s)]
*  He said more, quote, bad stuff will be out there unchecked. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=377.2s)]
*  But he said fewer people's posts and accounts will be taken down unnecessarily. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  Going forward, Zuckerberg said they'll turn to the same approach to handling false posts [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=386.0s)]
*  that Elon Musk adopted when he bought Twitter. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=390.2s)]
*  Musk got rid of the platform's restrictions on online speech and turned to a program [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  called Community Notes, which relies on users themselves to police false and misleading [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=398.08s)]
*  content. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  And finally. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=410.84s)]
*  Peter Yarrow of the legendary folk group Peter, Paul and Mary has died. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=430.08s)]
*  He was 86 years old. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  Yarrow got into music after taking a college class on American folk stories that inspired [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  him to start singing and playing the guitar. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=441.92s)]
*  Around 1960, he was introduced to Mary Travers and Noel Paul Stuckey, and the trio went on [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=444.44s)]
*  to bring the crunchy folk music scene into the American mainstream. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  The group was known for its progressive politics. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  To help express NSONG what this great meeting is all about, I give you now Peter, Paul and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=456.68s)]
*  Mary. They performed at the March on Washington, the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=465.4s)]
*  They also recorded one of the most iconic children's songs of the era, written by [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=480.88s)]
*  Yarrow. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=485.44s)]
*  He always insisted that Puff the Magic Dragon had nothing to do with smoking marijuana, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=486.4s)]
*  but people heard what they wanted to hear. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=496.84s)]
*  And the song floated up to the top of the Billboard charts, even spawned an animated TV [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=498.92s)]
*  show. Eventually, Peter, Paul and Mary moved towards solo projects, in part because Yarrow [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=503.04s)]
*  pleaded guilty to making sexual advances towards a teenager. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=509.24s)]
*  He served three months in prison before being pardoned by President Carter. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=512.88s)]
*  But the case continued to hang over his career, and a performance of his was canceled in 2019 [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=517.1600000000001s)]
*  during the height of the Me Too movement after there were protests. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=522.4000000000001s)]
*  Mary Travers died in 2009, so Stuckey, Paul, is now the only surviving member of the folk [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=526.4000000000001s)]
*  trio. Those are the headlines. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=531.7600000000001s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at the rise and fall of Justin Trudeau. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=537.12s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=542.08s)]
*  podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=545.32s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2U0onO8p78&t=547.5600000000001s)]
