# The Most Expensive Judicial Race in U.S. History, and a Growing Demand for Ivermectin
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, April [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=0.0s)]
*  1st. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=7.32s)]
*  Two elections today in two different states could offer the clearest view yet of how American [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=13.64s)]
*  voters are feeling about Donald Trump's presidency so far. First, in Wisconsin, there's an election [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=18.76s)]
*  to fill a seat on the state's Supreme Court, which will determine whether the court keeps [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  its liberal majority or flips conservative. The outcome could have national impact since [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=29.76s)]
*  the court will likely oversee key election related cases in the battleground state. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  The race has now become the most expensive judicial race in American history. The candidates [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=40.82s)]
*  and their supporters have spent nearly $100 million. A huge portion of that money has [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  come from Elon Musk and groups tied to him as the billionaire has thrown his support [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  behind the Trump-backed conservative candidate. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  Let me first hand out two $1 million checks in appreciation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=59.48s)]
*  Over the weekend, Musk took to the stage at a rally in support of the candidate, Brad [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  Schimel, and handed out two oversized checks to voters, the same stunt he used during the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=68.32s)]
*  presidential election. At the same time. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=73.96s)]
*  I'm working hard to make sure that voters understand that they should not stand for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  this, that we should not allow a seat on our Supreme Court to be bought. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=80.92s)]
*  The liberal candidate, Susan Crawford, and her campaign have been calling out Musk's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=85.48s)]
*  involvement and trying to mobilize voters who are upset with the drastic government [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  cuts he's carried out under President Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=94.16s)]
*  I spent several days traveling through a handful of towns in western Wisconsin. And to a person, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  when you stop Wisconsinites to talk about this local race, you will get an earful about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  what has been happening in D.C. over the first couple of months of the Trump administration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=109.0s)]
*  My colleague Ernesto Londoño has been reporting on the race. He says that for some supporters [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=114.9s)]
*  of the conservative candidate, a vote for Schimel is a way to also show their support [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  for what Musk and Trump are doing in Washington. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=123.98s)]
*  On the other hand, I also found liberals think Trump has gone too far in eroding core democratic [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  norms. You get a real sense of indignation, outrage and fear. And they see this election [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=133.18s)]
*  as a way to send a strong message from one of the battlegrounds of presidential races. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=139.66s)]
*  The second key race to watch today is a special election in Florida. The House seat that Michael [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=146.0s)]
*  Waltz used to hold is up for grabs. He vacated it to become President Trump's national security [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=151.42s)]
*  advisor. It's a majority Republican district and the Republican candidate is expected to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=156.74s)]
*  win. But the Democrat has been picking up momentum. As of a few weeks ago, he'd outraised [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  his opponent 10 to 1. And the surge of support has Republican leaders nervously watching [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=167.58s)]
*  what the final margin will be. A close race could be a warning sign for the GOP that concerns [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=173.34s)]
*  over Trump's presidency could be eroding Republican support down the ballot. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=179.38000000000002s)]
*  The Trump administration announced yesterday that it has sent another plane of deportees [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=188.52s)]
*  to a high security prison in El Salvador. On social media, President Trump shared a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=193.02s)]
*  video produced like a trailer for an action movie showing a US Air Force plane landing, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=201.94s)]
*  troops marching and handcuffed men being led away. The men are then shown kneeling in the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  prison while their heads are shaved. The White House says all 17 men who they described as [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=212.78s)]
*  gang members were deported under standard US immigration law. The administration supplied [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=218.04s)]
*  a list showing they'd either been accused or convicted of a crime that would make them [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=223.54s)]
*  eligible for deportation, including murder, assault and theft. Notably, the administration [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=227.38s)]
*  did not cite the Alien Enemies Act, the rationale it gave for its previous deportation flights [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  to El Salvador. That justification has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  For far too long, we allowed standards to slip and different standards for men and women [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=248.04s)]
*  and combat arms jobs. That's not acceptable. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced he's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=256.46s)]
*  eliminating the lower physical fitness requirements that had been in place for women in some combat [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=262.34s)]
*  roles. He announced the requirements must now be standardized for everyone. I'm signing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=267.52s)]
*  memorandum today. The services will review and soon we'll have nothing but the highest [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=272.96s)]
*  and equal standards for men and women in combat. When the military first opened up all combat [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  roles to women back in 2015, some branches set separate fitness standards for things [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  like pushups, sit-ups and distance runs. In the Marines, for example, where men had to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  complete 34 pushups in two minutes, women had to complete 15. Some officials saw that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=294.2s)]
*  as essential for recruiting and retaining female soldiers, but it also sparked a heated [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=301.06s)]
*  debate over whether that was compromising the readiness of combat units. Hegseth has [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  a history of saying women should not be in combat roles at all, though he softened that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=311.3s)]
*  during his confirmation hearing, where he essentially previewed this approach of allowing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=316.18s)]
*  women to serve only if they meet the same standards as men. The most elite units in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=320.74s)]
*  the military, like the Navy SEALs and Army Rangers, have always required all members [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=325.86s)]
*  to pass the same physical tests. Hegseth has ordered military leadership to implement [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=330.42s)]
*  the new standards by the end of October. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  Recently online searches for the drug ivermectin have been spiking, and doctors say they're [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=346.04s)]
*  fielding more and more questions about it, fueled in part by misinformation. The drug [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=350.92s)]
*  is primarily used as a treatment for parasites in humans and animals, but it became a household [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=355.84s)]
*  name during the pandemic when people claimed it could treat COVID. Research has shown it [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=361.06s)]
*  does not, though claims it can treat other illnesses are still spreading, particularly [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=365.94s)]
*  among right-wing influencers. Earlier this year, the actor Mel Gibson went on the Joe [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  Rogan podcast and said he had friends recover from stage four cancer after taking ivermectin [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=375.67999999999995s)]
*  and other drugs. A video of that episode got 10 million views. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=381.4s)]
*  The problem is that ivermectin is, as far as we know now, not a miracle drug, and that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  there are a number of things people are trying to use it for that just have not been proven. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=391.12s)]
*  Dani Bloom covers health for The Times. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  There is very early research into ivermectin and cancer. The problem is that that research [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=398.64s)]
*  is mostly in animals or in petri dishes. We don't have large clinical trials done in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=405.56s)]
*  humans. What we do know for sure is that if you take ivermectin in high doses, it can [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=412.36s)]
*  have these pretty devastating effects on the central nervous system. It can cause people [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=417.76s)]
*  to go into comas. It can lead to seizures. It can even be fatal. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=422.88s)]
*  A number of doctors that I spoke with expressed concern that people would turn to these unproven [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=427.56s)]
*  treatments without much input from a doctor. This doctor I spoke with said that he has [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=432.74s)]
*  seen patients with early stage, highly treatable tumors who forego cancer drugs and instead [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=438.62s)]
*  take ivermectin and come back months later with cancers that have spread. Doctors are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=445.62s)]
*  really getting concerned about not only the risks from the drug itself, but also people [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=451.3s)]
*  having this sort of do-it-yourself approach to medicine. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=456.5s)]
*  Danny says even as health providers are warning about the dangers of people taking ivermectin [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=461.94s)]
*  on their own, lawmakers in multiple Republican controlled states are trying to make it easier [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=466.73999999999995s)]
*  for people to get the drug. Last week, the governor of Arkansas signed a law allowing [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=472.46s)]
*  it to be sold over the counter. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=477.0s)]
*  And finally, it's one of the trends of the swinging sixties to find dining rooms in the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=480.0s)]
*  clouds. The rotating restaurant, an architectural novelty from the 1960s and 70s, is making [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=493.6s)]
*  a comeback. When you walk in, you can barely tell it's moving at all. But once you sit, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=499.88s)]
*  you really feel it. That's those glass walled circular dining rooms at the very top of skyscrapers [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=503.56s)]
*  that spin slowly around so you can take in the whole view. The first one opened in the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=509.32s)]
*  U.S. in 1961. That was La Ronde, perched above a shopping center in Honolulu. Then everybody [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=514.28s)]
*  wanted one. There's a rotating restaurant on top of the Space Needle in Seattle. St. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=521.0s)]
*  Louis, Indianapolis, Houston, and Detroit all had one. They sprang up in an age when [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=525.64s)]
*  construction in cities was booming and people wanted to see the changing skylines up close. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=530.4s)]
*  But over the decades, the trend faded. The machinery got old. Maintenance costs soared [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=536.2s)]
*  and there were safety concerns. Many of the restaurants stopped spinning or closed entirely. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=541.44s)]
*  Now though, what goes around comes back around. The revolving bar and restaurant on top of [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  the New York Marriott Marquis is spinning again, as are sky-high restaurants in Atlanta [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=552.12s)]
*  and San Francisco. In New York, they had to add a trick to make sure that diners don't [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=557.12s)]
*  get disoriented. Often, when people get up to use the bathroom, they have trouble finding [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=562.16s)]
*  their seat again because everything outside of the windows has shifted. So they've added [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=566.96s)]
*  a bunch of highly visible landmarks inside the restaurant to help people find their way. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=571.44s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. More on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=581.08s)]
*  how Elon Musk has put himself at the center of it. That's next in the New York Times [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=586.36s)]
*  audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBDVK8qmVg&t=591.26s)]
