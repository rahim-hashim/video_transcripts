# Division at the Democratic Convention, and G.O.P. Efforts to Impeach Joe Biden
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, August [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=0.0s)]
*  19th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=7.22s)]
*  In Chicago today, the Democratic National Convention kicks off as the party tries to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=14.46s)]
*  ride the wave of energy and enthusiasm that the Harris Walls ticket has sparked in recent [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=19.38s)]
*  weeks. President Biden is set to give the main speech tonight, saying that Harris is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  ready to finish the campaign he started. Despite the unity that the Democrats are trying [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=29.98s)]
*  to project, one major fault line in the party will be on display. Tensions over the war [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=35.56s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=42.02s)]
*  Protesters who have denounced the Biden administration's support of Israel and its military campaign [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=49.66s)]
*  in Gaza were already out in force last night, and the city's prepared for thousands more [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=53.78s)]
*  demonstrators to take to the streets. Meanwhile, inside the event, organizers have scheduled [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=58.94s)]
*  a wide range of speakers hoping to appease different factions of the party. They've [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=64.86s)]
*  invited the attorney general of Minnesota, Keith Ellison, a prominent Muslim, to speak. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=70.34s)]
*  They've given a slot to the families of American hostages held by Hamas. And Harris's husband, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=75.38s)]
*  Doug Emhoff, is expected to talk about his own Jewish identity. Times political reporter [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=80.66s)]
*  Jonathan Weissman, who's at the convention, says what's less clear is how the party's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=85.94s)]
*  nominee will navigate the divisions herself. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=91.1s)]
*  We're not sure what Kamala Harris will say about this issue at the convention. When you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=94.5s)]
*  look at polling, even polling of young voters, the war in Gaza and Israel-Palestine issues [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=100.86s)]
*  is way down, nowhere close to inflation or housing costs or abortion. So it's not at [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=108.1s)]
*  all clear that the Israel-Palestine issue really will influence the outcome of the election [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=115.48s)]
*  in November. And that leaves the Harris campaign with an interesting conundrum going into this [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=121.72s)]
*  convention. Do they speak out or do they say, you know, this just isn't an issue that's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=127.72s)]
*  going to decide whether Kamala Harris is going to be the next president. Let's just let it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=134.68s)]
*  rest. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=140.28s)]
*  As the convention gets underway, new polling from the Times and Siena College shows just [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=142.84s)]
*  how much the switch from Biden to Harris is reshaping the presidential race. Just a few [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=147.96s)]
*  months ago, polls showed Donald Trump was firmly in the lead in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=153.6s)]
*  and North Carolina. Now Harris has surged to become a contender in those states. In [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=159.28s)]
*  Arizona, for example, Trump led Biden 50 to 41 in May. Now it's Harris in the lead with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=165.92s)]
*  50 percent of support among likely voters compared to Trump's 45. This morning, House [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=173.04s)]
*  Republicans formally made the case to impeach President Biden, releasing a report that accuses [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=185.44s)]
*  the president of corruption tied to his son, Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=191.72s)]
*  The report doesn't include any direct proof that Biden engaged in corruption, but Republicans [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=197.04s)]
*  say he can still be impeached for what they see as his betrayal of public trust. This [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=202.96s)]
*  report in many ways marks the end of what's been a very lengthy and intense investigation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=208.28s)]
*  Times congressional reporter Luke Broadwater has been covering the impeachment inquiry [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=215.6s)]
*  into Biden, which Republicans started last year. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=219.4s)]
*  What they did in this report, which is nearly 300 pages long, is they painted a very damning [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=222.84s)]
*  picture of the business practices of Hunter Biden and President Biden's brother, James. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=227.96s)]
*  They essentially accused them of going around the world and enticing foreign entities into [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=234.96s)]
*  investing with them and partnering with them under the essentially false impression they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=244.16s)]
*  could deliver big dollar deals within the United States for these foreign interests. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=249.88s)]
*  And the Republicans have attempted to tie President Biden to these deals and say the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=256.4s)]
*  only reason anyone ever paid Jim and Hunter Biden money was because they believe they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=261.8s)]
*  could influence President Biden, who was then Vice President Biden, to essentially behave [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=267.64s)]
*  corruptly and give them things they didn't otherwise deserve. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=273.86s)]
*  They do not prove that in this report at all. Essentially, what they do prove is that President [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=278.90000000000003s)]
*  Biden at times met with business partners of James and Hunter briefly, exchanged pleasantries, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=284.98s)]
*  but they do not have any evidence of any corrupt act to benefit those businesses on behalf [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=293.5s)]
*  of President Biden. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=299.1s)]
*  Luke says it's unclear if House Republicans will try to call for an official vote to impeach [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=300.98s)]
*  Biden when they return to Capitol Hill in September. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=305.38s)]
*  But even if a vote did pass the House, an impeachment effort will almost certainly fall [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  flat in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=313.82s)]
*  Good to be back in Israel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  This is my ninth visit since October 7th to Israel, to the Middle East. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=322.82s)]
*  This is a decisive moment. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=328.74s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel this morning to continue to push for a ceasefire [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=331.3s)]
*  deal. His visit comes after negotiators met last week, and while they have yet to reach [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=336.34s)]
*  an agreement, officials involved in the talks describe them as constructive. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=341.5s)]
*  It is time for it to get done. It's also time to make sure that no one takes any steps that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=346.14s)]
*  could derail this process. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  Negotiators are hoping that a ceasefire deal in Gaza could bring down tensions across [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=355.22s)]
*  the entire region, which have been high after Iran and Hezbollah threatened to retaliate [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=359.02000000000004s)]
*  against Israel over the assassinations of militant leaders. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=363.86s)]
*  Blinken will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=367.86s)]
*  later today. He's also expected to visit Egypt on this trip. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=372.86s)]
*  Negotiators are hoping to gather there and continue the ceasefire talks later this week. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  The Times has learned that former Republican Congressman George Santos is expected to plead [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=385.22s)]
*  guilty today to avoid trial on the multiple felony charges that he's facing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=393.74s)]
*  Santos became one of just six members of the House in American history to ever be expelled [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=399.1s)]
*  after it was revealed that the New York representative spun an enormous tangled web of lies about [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=405.06s)]
*  and was charged with a series of financial crimes. Prosecutors say he stole money from [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=411.18s)]
*  donors by charging their credit cards multiple times, used campaign money for personal expenses [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=416.7s)]
*  like luxury clothing, and collected unemployment money while he was employed, among other alleged [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=422.5s)]
*  crimes. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=429.34000000000003s)]
*  One person familiar with details about Santos' plans told the Times he's going to give a [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  statement in court today acknowledging his crimes. It's not yet clear what the terms [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=435.46s)]
*  of his plea deal are or what sentence he might face. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=440.34s)]
*  And finally, audiences love a medical drama. See 20 Seasons of Grey's Anatomy. They also [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=449.82s)]
*  love a good medical documentary, even with no actors or love triangles. And now these [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=456.38s)]
*  real-world documentaries are proving so popular that one New York hospital system is opening [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=462.41999999999996s)]
*  its own production studio. Northwell Hospital is familiar to people who watch the Netflix [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=467.5s)]
*  hit Lennox Hill about doctors and patients on the Upper East Side. They had so much success [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=472.94s)]
*  with that show and other documentaries filmed there that they've opened Northwell Studios [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=478.82s)]
*  and have five new productions underway. The move is raising questions about logistics [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=483.8s)]
*  and patient privacy. Another hospital faced a multimillion-dollar penalty after TV crews [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=489.62s)]
*  filmed patients without consent at their facility. But Northwell's CEOs say they're very careful [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=495.66s)]
*  to get everyone's permission. The hospital's CEO said he feels, quote, a real responsibility [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=501.38s)]
*  to provide educational material to the public about what goes on inside a health care facility. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=507.66s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, Astead Herndon, who's been covering Kamala [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=515.74s)]
*  Harris for years, unpacks key moments in her political career and what they reveal about [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=520.1800000000001s)]
*  how she would lead the country if she's elected. You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=525.84s)]
*  you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms4QTaDYZ7U&t=531.3s)]
