# Trump’s Iran Deadline, TikTok’s Future in the US, Your Friday News Quiz | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Friday, June 20th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=8.32s)]
*  I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on the fact that there's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  near future. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=24.0s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=25.0s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=30.08s)]
*  The White House announced on Thursday that President Trump may take up to two weeks to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=33.28s)]
*  decide whether the U.S. will join Israel in its war against Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=37.56s)]
*  The deadline gives the U.S. time to prepare for possible military action, for example, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  allowing a second aircraft carrier to get into place and defend U.S. bases in the region. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Iranian intelligence agencies believe Iran has still not decided whether to make a nuclear [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=52.8s)]
*  bomb. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=57.04s)]
*  If the U.S. were to attack Iran or its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, officials [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  say that could drive the country towards producing a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=63.08s)]
*  But Trump's timeline also gives Iran a chance to reenter negotiations over the future of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  its nuclear program. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=71.84s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader rejected a deal earlier this month, which would have cut off the country's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=73.56s)]
*  main path to a nuclear weapon by ending enrichment on Iranian soil. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=77.72s)]
*  The country's foreign minister is set to be in Geneva today to meet with top diplomats [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=82.36s)]
*  from Britain, France and Germany. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=86.66s)]
*  They're expected to push Iran on making significant concessions in its nuclear program. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel has accused Iran of firing cluster munitions into a populated area. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=95.24s)]
*  Those are bombs that burst and scatter smaller bombs indiscriminately, which can remain unexploded [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=102.84s)]
*  for months or years like landmines. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=107.86s)]
*  The Times spoke with experts who said the evidence supports Israel's claim. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=110.8s)]
*  More than 100 countries have signed an agreement to ban cluster munitions, but neither Iran [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=115.32s)]
*  nor Israel have adopted that ban. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=120.36s)]
*  The U.S. and other powers like Russia, China and India have also not signed the agreement. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=123.44s)]
*  In California, a federal appeals court has cleared the way for President Trump to use [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=130.0s)]
*  the National Guard in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=140.88s)]
*  The three-judge panel issued a unanimous ruling. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=145.52s)]
*  Two of the judges had been appointed by Trump and one by former President Joe Biden. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=148.68s)]
*  A lower court judge had previously ruled that the protests were not severe enough for Trump [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=153.2s)]
*  to invoke a rarely used law and federalize the National Guard over objections from California [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=158.24s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=163.88s)]
*  But the appeals court said the conditions in Los Angeles, which had hindered some immigration [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=165.68s)]
*  enforcement, were sufficient to invoke the law. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  The Trump administration had also argued that the judiciary should not have the power at [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=173.08s)]
*  all to review the president's decision to take control of the National Guard. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  The federal appeals court, however, rejected that argument, saying judicial review is warranted. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=182.28s)]
*  President Trump has given the Chinese owners of the video app TikTok another opportunity [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=187.36s)]
*  to avoid a U.S. ban. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order giving TikTok's parent company ByteDance [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=202.9s)]
*  90 more days to find a new owner, just as Trump's previous extension, signed in April, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=207.16000000000003s)]
*  ended. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  Last year, Congress passed a law prohibiting platforms in the U.S. from hosting the app [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=215.04s)]
*  until it sold, citing national security concerns. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=219.2s)]
*  But Trump's executive orders tell the Justice Department not to enforce that ban. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  This marks the third extension that Trump has given ByteDance since he took office. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  ByteDance says they're quote, absolutely confident in a resolution. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=232.16s)]
*  But at the White House, reporters pressed Caroline Levitt, Trump's press secretary, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=236.18s)]
*  on why this time would be different. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=240.12s)]
*  Why does President Trump believe that this 90-day extension on TikTok will provide more [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=242.16s)]
*  runway perhaps than the previous extensions that haven't led to a divestment deal? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=247.28s)]
*  Because it's more time, more time to make a good deal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  Simple question, Dasha. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=253.72s)]
*  Just a few months ago, TikTok's future in the United States seemed anything but certain. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=255.64s)]
*  The Supreme Court had ruled in favor of this law that was calling to ban the company and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=260.78s)]
*  people were freaking out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=265.96s)]
*  But now they're in a very, very different position. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=267.92s)]
*  My colleague Sapna Maheshwari has been reporting on how TikTok is responding to the legal limbo. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=271.28s)]
*  They've been going out telling advertisers that their future is looking secure and great. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=276.67999999999995s)]
*  And I wanted to go this week to this big advertising festival in Cannes, France to see what the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=282.84s)]
*  company would be doing there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  So there on the French Riviera, TikTok was in fantastic spirits. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=290.29999999999995s)]
*  They had set up shop at an incredibly fancy hotel called the Carlton Hotel and created [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  something called TikTok Garden. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=300.56s)]
*  They flew out big creators who were there to do panels and to meet with fans. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=302.52s)]
*  While I was there, I talked to advertisers and creators who all said the same thing, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=308.24s)]
*  that the ban was the furthest thing from their minds. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=312.68s)]
*  They said it didn't seem like it was really happening. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=315.84s)]
*  And it was just not on their radar the way it was in January when people were signing up [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=318.68s)]
*  for Red Note, this Chinese app. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=323.84s)]
*  They were posting tearful videos talking about the fact that TikTok might be going away any [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  day now. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=329.72s)]
*  So the company now has until the middle of September with this latest extension, which [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=333.56s)]
*  raises the question, of course, how many times is President Trump going to give TikTok an [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  extension to either sell or be banned? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=343.56s)]
*  You know, could this continue throughout the rest of his administration? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think that's a real possibility. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=350.48s)]
*  It could also be that TikTok is something of a bargaining chip if talks with China [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=352.72s)]
*  sour at any point, or the company, you know, if these extensions continue, could be [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=358.2s)]
*  vulnerable if a new administration comes in and decides that the federal law should be [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=363.68s)]
*  upheld. But ultimately, what we're looking at with TikTok is a pretty unprecedented [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=368.76s)]
*  situation where a federal law signed by a previous president and upheld by the Supreme [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=373.24s)]
*  Court is all but being ignored. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=378.28s)]
*  After years of automakers pivoting to the electric vehicle market, hybrid cars are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=388.2s)]
*  starting to see a resurgence. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=393.56s)]
*  In the first three months of this year, hybrids made up about 14% of all light vehicles [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=396.12s)]
*  sold in the U.S., about double that of EVs. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=400.84s)]
*  Companies like Ford and Honda are seeing sales of their hybrid models rise significantly. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=404.44s)]
*  So far this year, half of all cars and trucks sold by Toyota and its luxury brand Lexus [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  have been hybrids. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=413.96s)]
*  Once seen as a transition between a gasoline powered past and an inevitable all electric [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  future, hybrid cars seem to have staying power. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  They're much more affordable than purely electric vehicles, and their gas mileage is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=424.08s)]
*  better than purely gas powered cars. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=428.08s)]
*  Plus, today's hybrids are much smoother than earlier models, making the transition between [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=430.47999999999996s)]
*  electric and gas power virtually unnoticeable. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=435.2s)]
*  Proposed federal legislation could push hybrid sales even higher if the federal law [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=438.64s)]
*  could push hybrid sales even higher. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=443.2s)]
*  A Republican bill working its way through Congress would eliminate a seventy five hundred [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=445.44s)]
*  dollar tax credit for electric vehicles, presumably making hybrids a more attractive option to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  some buyers. The bill still includes a hundred dollar annual tax on hybrid ownership. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=454.64s)]
*  And finally, the Crunchwrap Supreme classic Taco Bell tastes grilled to go anywhere. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=465.52s)]
*  This weekend, Taco Bell's Crunchwrap Supreme officially turns 20. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  Happy birthday, my friend. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=475.68s)]
*  And in those two decades, the fast food mashup has gone from an almost comical menu item [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=477.28s)]
*  to an unlikely inspiration for chefs. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=482.32s)]
*  When the Crunchwrap first debuted in 2005, the brainchild of Taco Bell product developer [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  Lois Carson, it wildly exceeded expectations, becoming the fastest selling menu item in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  the chain's history. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=495.28s)]
*  The dish, if you're unfamiliar with this culinary wonder. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=496.84s)]
*  Beef, warm nacho cheese sauce, a crunchy tostada shell, lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=500.96s)]
*  all loaded into a flour tortilla. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=506.0s)]
*  Was designed in a way that addressed one of Taco Bell's longstanding problems, how to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  make a wrap that wasn't messy to eat in the car. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=512.48s)]
*  I just made the famous Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme at home. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=515.36s)]
*  Now chefs across the country are having fun creating their own versions with trademark [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=519.04s)]
*  skirting names. The restaurant Aunt Ginny's in Queens, New York, makes a crisp wrap ultimate [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=524.0s)]
*  with slow roasted pork. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=529.36s)]

*  essentially act as free advertising. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=554.84s)]
*  As one chef puts it, the Crunchwrap is no longer just a gimmick owned by Taco Bell, but [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=557.16s)]

*  Now for the quiz. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=612.56s)]
*  We've got questions about three stories the Times has covered this week. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  Can you answer them all? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=620.92s)]
*  First up, my supporters are America first. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=625.16s)]
*  They make America great again. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  My supporters don't want to see Iran having nuclear weapon. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=629.8399999999999s)]
*  President Trump is facing criticism from some of his most loyal supporters over his [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=633.0s)]
*  openness to involving the U.S. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=637.52s)]
*  in Israel's attacks on Iran. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=639.68s)]
*  The issue has split Trump's coalition and led to some public feuds. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=641.96s)]
*  We're going to play a clip from one of those debates that went viral this week. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=646.5200000000001s)]
*  Can you name the two men arguing? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=650.08s)]
*  How many people living around, by the way? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=652.6s)]
*  I don't know the population. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=654.44s)]
*  At all? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  No, I don't know the population. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=656.8800000000001s)]
*  You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=659.0s)]
*  I don't sit around memorizing population tables. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, it's kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the government. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=665.24s)]
*  That was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and right wing media personality Tucker Carlson. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=668.44s)]
*  So I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=676.6s)]
*  And if that was too easy, a bonus question. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=681.1600000000001s)]
*  What is the population of Iran? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=683.7600000000001s)]
*  The answer, according to the CIA World Factbook, is 88 million. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=691.6s)]
*  Carlson put the figure at 92 million. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=696.48s)]
*  OK, next question. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=698.44s)]
*  This week, chef and Food Network star Anne Burrell died at the age of 55. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=702.9200000000001s)]

*  What is the name of that show? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  A hint. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=729.44s)]
*  It's a cooking competition show with people who have terrible skills in the kitchen. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=733.0400000000001s)]
*  The answer, worst cooks in America. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=744.4000000000001s)]
*  Frankie, why did you just throw those tomatoes away? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=747.8000000000001s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=752.72s)]
*  On the show, Burrell came off as a tough but fun aunt with a big down to earth personality. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=754.52s)]
*  Fellow Food Network star Rachel Ray called her the Betty Davis of food TV celebrity. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=760.0400000000001s)]
*  OK, last question. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=767.52s)]
*  The once and future king who has grown to fulfill a destiny of greatness in the world of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=769.1600000000001s)]
*  competitive eating. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=777.24s)]
*  There is one man who stands alone. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=778.72s)]
*  I give you the number one ranked eater in the world. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=781.4799999999999s)]
*  Joey Chestnut, the Michael Jordan of stuffing his face with frankfurters has won the annual [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=785.4s)]
*  Nathan's famous hot dog eating contest 16 times. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=793.52s)]
*  He set the events record in 2021, crushing 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=797.4s)]
*  This week, Chestnut announced he will be back in Coney Island for the contest next month [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=803.28s)]
*  after organizers blocked him from competing last year. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=807.8000000000001s)]
*  So why had he been banned? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=811.48s)]
*  Was it a sponsorship conflict, B allegations of cheating or C making derogatory comments [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=814.76s)]
*  about major league eating, which runs the competition? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=824.6s)]
*  The answer is A, a sponsorship conflict, at least according to Nathan's. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=827.2s)]
*  Chestnut had inked a deal with a company that makes plant based hot dogs, perhaps a faux [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=840.32s)]
*  paw for someone competing in a meat based event. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=845.36s)]
*  He said he and organizers had come to an agreement on the sponsorship issue for this year, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=848.5200000000001s)]
*  and he'll be back on ESPN for the contest. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=852.84s)]
*  Chestnut also said he'll continue to partner with companies in the plant based space while [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=855.64s)]
*  noting, quote, Those relationships were never a conflict with my love for hot dogs. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=860.28s)]
*  All right, that's it for the news quiz. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRClTfOvPs&t=866.4s)]
