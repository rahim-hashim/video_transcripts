# A Republican Trifecta, and Trump’s Latest Pick Creates Shock Waves
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=4.68s)]
*  Today's Thursday, November 14th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=5.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=8.24s)]
*  It's official. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=13.92s)]
*  Republicans cemented their control of the House of Representatives late last night, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=15.52s)]
*  giving the GOP the trifecta, full control of the House, the Senate, and the White House. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=19.88s)]
*  Republicans in the House and Senate have a mandate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=25.88s)]
*  It's true. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=27.52s)]
*  It was a decisive win across the nation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=28.52s)]
*  The American people want us to implement and deliver that America First agenda. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=30.56s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson spoke on the steps of the Capitol earlier this week about what [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=35.04s)]
*  a full Republican sweep will mean. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=39.4s)]
*  Party leaders have said they intend to move quickly to cut taxes, loosen regulations on [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  oil production, and tighten border security. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=46.66s)]
*  When President Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, we all look back and recognize that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=50.04s)]
*  the Republican Party was not fully prepared for that moment and precious time was wasted [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=55.92s)]
*  in the beginning of that Congress. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=59.96s)]
*  We are not going to make those mistakes again. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=61.64s)]
*  We will be ready on day one. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=64.08s)]
*  We are prepared this time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=65.52s)]
*  And as we wind down the 118th Congress... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=66.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the Senate, Republicans voted for their new majority leader and picked [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=69.48s)]
*  John Thune of South Dakota, who has clashed with Donald Trump in the past, but said he's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  now eager to enact Trump's agenda. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=78.76s)]
*  One of his first tasks will likely be trying to push Trump's nominees through the confirmation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=82.2s)]
*  process. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=86.76s)]
*  There have been an avalanche of picks this week, but the president-elect made his most [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=87.76s)]
*  stunning one yet yesterday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=92.2s)]
*  He tapped Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida for attorney general. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=94.48s)]
*  Gaetz is one of Trump's fiercest defenders and an avowed enemy of virtually every other [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=99.04s)]
*  top Republican. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=104.44s)]
*  He was behind the successful ouster of Kevin McCarthy from the House Speaker post, and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  he was previously investigated by the Justice Department for child sex trafficking, but [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=110.96s)]
*  not charged. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=115.24s)]
*  The House has also been investigating him on allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=116.8s)]
*  drug use, and whether he used campaign funds for personal use. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=121.55999999999999s)]
*  One of Gaetz's fellow Republican representatives, Max Miller of Ohio, said he and his colleagues [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=126.38s)]
*  were happy about the pick only because it meant Gaetz would be leaving the House, saying, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=131.72s)]
*  quote, most people in there are giddy about it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=136.88s)]
*  Get him out of here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=139.32s)]
*  Gaetz resigned from the House almost immediately after being nominated, effectively ending [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=140.88s)]
*  the House ethics investigation into him. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  They were going to vote tomorrow on whether to release a highly critical report on Gaetz, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=148.32s)]
*  and it's not clear if they will still release their findings. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=152.64s)]
*  If Gaetz does become attorney general, it will put him in a position to carry out Trump's [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=156.28s)]
*  promise to exact revenge on federal officials who prosecuted him. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=160.84s)]
*  One of the open questions, I think, that come out of this process as far as it's unfolded [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=165.5s)]
*  so far is what the Trump and American voter appetite will be for an administration that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=171.0s)]
*  is so geared toward revenge and retribution when you have voters who have elected you [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=178.78s)]
*  on issues like the economy and immigration and crime. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=185.26s)]
*  Times reporter Katie Rogers is covering Trump's latest staff pick. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=189.56s)]
*  Does appointing somebody like Matt Gaetz to the DOJ to dismantle checks on power, is that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=193.78s)]
*  going to be something the average voter is going to look at and say, yes, this is what [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=200.36s)]
*  I voted for? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=204.32s)]
*  I think the tension between voters wanting the Trump administration to accomplish things [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=205.32s)]
*  for them is going to butt up against a very different objective for Trump, which is taking [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=210.18s)]
*  out revenge on perceived enemies within the institutions that are checks on the presidency. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=215.74s)]
*  At the White House yesterday. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=223.5s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, elect and former president, Donald, congratulations. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=227.3s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=232.3s)]
*  Looking forward to having a likely said smooth transition. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=234.3s)]
*  President Biden hosted president-elect Trump for a meeting, part of the traditional handoff [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=239.74s)]
*  from one president to the next, a tradition that Trump himself skipped when he refused [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  to concede in 2020. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=248.96s)]
*  In the Oval Office, Trump thanked Biden and the two shook hands. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=251.29999999999998s)]
*  Politics is tough and it's many cases not a very nice world, but it is a nice world [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=255.54s)]
*  today and I appreciate it very much. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=261.94s)]
*  A transition that's so smooth, it'll be as smooth as it can get. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=264.3s)]
*  Cameras were escorted out of the room after about 30 seconds and the two then met for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=269.18s)]
*  two hours behind closed doors with their chiefs of staff. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=272.96s)]
*  The White House said Trump came with a detailed list of questions for Biden, that the conversation [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  had been cordial and substantive. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=281.24s)]
*  Trump later called the New York Post and said the two had talked about the war in Ukraine [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=283.62s)]
*  and the conflict in the Middle East. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=288.48s)]
*  Trump said, quote, I wanted to know his views on where we are and what he thinks, and he [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=290.6s)]
*  gave them to me. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=294.92s)]
*  It could have been better. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  It could have been worse. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  That's how one economist described the latest inflation numbers released yesterday by the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=304.64s)]
*  federal government. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=308.76s)]
*  The consumer price index climbed 2.6 percent from a year ago, the latest reassurance that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  inflation has been brought way down from its peak of over 9 percent in 2022. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's still slightly higher than last month's numbers and it means prices on everything [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=321.96s)]
*  from food to rent are still climbing and are much higher for Americans than they were a [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=326.35999999999996s)]
*  few years ago. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=331.12s)]
*  Efforts to keep fighting inflation could be complicated by the transition to a new [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=333.12s)]
*  administration. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=337.23999999999995s)]
*  Trump has promised big increases in tariffs that most economists think would drive inflation [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=338.94s)]
*  back up. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=344.5s)]
*  Earlier this week in China, a man plowed his SUV into a crowd of people exercising outside [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=352.14s)]
*  of a sports complex in the city of Zhuhai, killing 35 people and injuring dozens more. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=357.58s)]
*  It appeared to be the deadliest attack in the country in a decade. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=363.82s)]
*  But almost immediately, the Chinese government began to censor any details about it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  By the time that I was able to get to Zhuhai on basically the first flight out, the police [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=373.38s)]
*  and the government officials were already working super hard to make it seem like nothing [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=378.54s)]
*  had ever happened. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=382.86s)]
*  Vivian Wong covers China for the Times. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  Our first stop, we went to two different hospitals where we had heard that victims had been taken. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=386.94s)]
*  We wanted to see if we could find any victims or their relatives, but that was quickly quashed [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=393.66s)]
*  because in all of the different ICU wards that we checked, there were government officials [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=399.94s)]
*  standing guard, making sure that we could not reach the family members, even though [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=405.18s)]
*  in one hospital actually we could see the family members standing just a short distance [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=409.74s)]
*  away. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=413.62s)]
*  Then we went to the sports center where the attack actually happened, and there was also [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=414.62s)]
*  a steady stream of local residents who were coming by to drop off flowers as a sort of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=419.7s)]
*  makeshift memorial. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=425.1s)]
*  And basically the minute they would drop them off, someone, a worker, would come and pick [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=426.98s)]
*  them up and carry them out of sight. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=431.3s)]
*  Vivian says the government's efforts to brush the attack under the rug also played out online. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=434.38s)]
*  Censors quickly took down eyewitness accounts and newspaper articles and only left up the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=440.1s)]
*  official government statement about the incident, saying the attacker had been unhappy about [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=444.42s)]
*  his divorce. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=448.54s)]
*  This is straight out of the Chinese government's playbook after any sort of mass incident or [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=450.3s)]
*  tragedy. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=455.90000000000003s)]
*  Basically the goal is to ensure that the government narrative is the only voice out there so that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  people can't mobilize around grief, they can't ask questions about the government's response. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=463.54s)]
*  And a big part of that is that the Chinese government has really made a sort of unspoken [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=469.18s)]
*  contract with its people, which is that it's going to surveil them, it's going to really [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  limit their rights, but in return they're going to get a really safe society. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=478.68s)]
*  And so the government just really doesn't want there to ever be any sign that that safety [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=484.34000000000003s)]
*  is not maybe as perfect or as complete as they would want their people to believe. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=489.16s)]
*  And finally, there's a big art show in Pisa, Italy this week with big names, Salvador [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13vCyZe8g0&t=501.64s)]
