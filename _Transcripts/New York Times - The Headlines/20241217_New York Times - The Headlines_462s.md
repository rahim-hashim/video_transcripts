# A Perilous Time for Europe, and a Brazen Assassination in Moscow
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, December 17th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=7.92s)]
*  In Europe, a crisis of leadership is spreading. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=14.44s)]
*  Yesterday, the German government collapsed after the country's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=17.8s)]
*  lost a confidence vote. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=22.96s)]
*  The country will now hold a snap election months earlier than voting was planned. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=24.88s)]
*  The turmoil in Germany comes as France has also been flailing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=29.88s)]
*  Its prime minister resigned after a vote of no confidence in the government there just [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  weeks ago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=37.68s)]
*  France is now on its fourth prime minister this year, a record level of turnover. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  And across Europe, growing polarization has made it exceptionally difficult to build political [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=44.68s)]
*  coalitions, and the rise of far-right parties has scrambled the balance of power. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=49.4s)]
*  Germany and France are also facing a complex array of hot-button issues, with fierce debates [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=55.24s)]
*  over how to fix their struggling economies, immigration policy, and national defense. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=59.92s)]
*  In Germany in particular, one of the most divisive questions heading into the elections [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=65.2s)]
*  will be how much to continue supporting Ukraine, with some politicians calling for more military [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=70.08s)]
*  aid while others are warning that aggressive support could provoke Russia, which has been [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=75.68s)]
*  ramping up its threats against Europe. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=80.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Moscow early this morning, a Russian general was killed in one of the most [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  brazen assassinations there in years. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Igor Kirolov, the head of Russia's radioactive, chemical, and biological defense forces, died [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=92.28s)]
*  after a bomb planted in a scooter exploded outside of an apartment building. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=97.6s)]
*  One of his aides was also killed. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=101.8s)]
*  A Ukrainian security official told the Times that Ukraine was behind the attack. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=103.6s)]
*  The country's main security agency had charged Kirolov yesterday, in absentia, over his [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=108.8s)]
*  role in the war. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=113.6s)]
*  In response to the assassination, a leader of the Russian Security Council promised retaliation [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  against Ukrainian military and political leaders. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=120.16s)]
*  One of the big differences between the first term and the first term, everybody was fighting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=127.96s)]
*  me. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=132.2s)]
*  In this term, everybody wants to be my friend. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=133.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=135.28s)]
*  My personality changed or something. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=136.28s)]
*  In an elect, Donald Trump held his first press conference since the election yesterday, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=139.0s)]
*  riffing that he seems to be getting better treatment this time around. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=144.04s)]
*  The entire Republican Party is basically on board with his agenda. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=147.88s)]
*  World leaders have been flying to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him, and billionaire tech executives [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=152.04s)]
*  have been writing multi-million dollar checks to support him. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=156.56s)]
*  Trump talked for more than an hour about vaccines, the border wall, foreign policy, and even [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=160.16s)]
*  the drone sightings haunting New Jersey. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=165.0s)]
*  I can't imagine it's the enemy because if it was the enemy, they'd blast it out, even [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=167.32s)]
*  if they were late, they'd blast it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=171.56s)]
*  Trump also praised two of his most controversial picks for cabinet members, Pete Hegseth for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=173.44s)]
*  Secretary of Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=178.84s)]
*  indicating he's standing by them for now, even as they face potentially difficult confirmation [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=184.04s)]
*  hearings in the Senate. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=188.56s)]
*  Hours after the press conference, Trump was dealt a legal setback. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=189.96s)]
*  A judge in New York rejected his attempt to clear his felony record. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=199.56s)]
*  Trump's legal team had argued that the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity should [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  apply in the Manhattan case, where he was convicted of covering up hush money payments. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  The judge disagreed, saying the acts in question were, quote, decidedly personal, not the kind [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=212.84s)]
*  of official actions that are covered by the Supreme Court ruling. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=218.3s)]
*  Trump's likely to appeal that potentially all the way up to the Supreme Court itself. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  He still hasn't been sentenced in the case, though he cannot be sent to jail while he's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=226.5s)]
*  president. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=230.22s)]
*  At 1057 a.m., a second grade student called 911 to report a shooting had occurred at school. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=231.22s)]
*  In Madison, Wisconsin, police say that a student opened fire at a small Christian school yesterday, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=247.06s)]
*  killing two people, a student and a teacher, and injuring at least six more. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=260.86s)]
*  The shooter has now been identified as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, who went by the name Samantha. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  She was a student at the school, and evidence suggests she died from a self-inflicted gunshot [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=275.14s)]
*  wound. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=280.9s)]
*  A female suspect in a school shooting is exceedingly rare. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=281.9s)]
*  Madison Police Chief Sean Barnes said investigators have searched her home and are still looking [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=285.78s)]
*  into how she got the weapon and what may have been behind the attack. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=290.3s)]
*  He said her parents were cooperating with police. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=294.06s)]
*  My colleague Julie Bosman got to the scene yesterday as rattled parents were reuniting [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=296.84s)]
*  with their children. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=301.38s)]
*  I spoke with one man who told me that he was at work nearby when he heard of what had happened, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  and he of course immediately started sprinting out to his car, got in his car, drove as close [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=309.18s)]
*  to the school as he could, and when he realized that he couldn't get close enough to the school, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=315.38s)]
*  parked his car and then just started racing through people's backyards to try to get to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  the school because he just needed to get to his children. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=325.54s)]
*  This year, more than 260 people have been injured or killed in school shootings across [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=331.7s)]
*  the country. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=336.18s)]
*  And finally, the legendary percussionist Zakir Hussain died this week at 73. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  He was a virtuoso at the tabla, tuned drums that have been used for hundreds of years [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=351.09999999999997s)]
*  in classical Indian music. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  He played a lot of other instruments as well. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=357.18s)]
*  Over his career, he fused musical styles with a lot of different collaborators, playing [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=360.32s)]
*  with Ravi Shankar, sitting in on Grateful Dead jam sessions, collaborating with Yo-Yo Ma. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=364.68s)]
*  Growing up in Mumbai, he heard a little bit of everything, studying Indian classical music [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=371.12s)]
*  for three hours every morning, reciting the Koran at a madrasa, singing hymns at a Catholic [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=375.44s)]
*  church. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  He played his first paid concert at 12 and went on to appear on hundreds of albums and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=381.3s)]
*  win multiple Grammy Awards. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=386.3s)]
*  When I was a young man, I wanted to wear blingy outfits and have people screaming and shouting [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=388.42s)]
*  at every move I make. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=395.90000000000003s)]
*  When accepting a lifetime achievement award a few years ago, he talked about how he once [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  told George Harrison from The Beatles that he wanted to be a rock and roll drummer. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=403.16s)]
*  But Harrison told him there were a million of those. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=407.16s)]
*  Playing the tabla for the world was what could make him stand out. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  He said, you are here with me because you have this unique ability to be able to take [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=414.12s)]
*  your instrument, the tabla, and make it talk the language of the present. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=418.92s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=431.04s)]
*  Today on The Daily, tens of thousands of Syrians disappeared under the rule of Bashar al-Assad. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=432.2s)]
*  Times reporter Christina Goldbaum goes inside one of the prisons where people were searching [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=438.68s)]
*  for their friends and family. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=443.08s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=445.44s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=449.92s)]
*  The headlines will be back tomorrow. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIikDnNj6v0&t=450.92s)]
