# Trump Threatens Iran's Leader, Fear at Gaza Aid Sites, a Pay Raise for Cheerleaders | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=4.8s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, June 18th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=6.44s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=8.24s)]
*  As the conflict between Israel and Iran continues into its sixth day, President Trump has taken [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=13.36s)]
*  a newly combative tone calling for Iran's, quote, unconditional surrender and threatening [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=18.66s)]
*  its supreme leader, writing on social media, quote, our patience is wearing thin. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=24.2s)]
*  The comments came before Trump met with his national security team on Tuesday, and it's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=29.32s)]
*  the latest signal that the U.S. may be considering joining Israel's bombing campaign against [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=33.6s)]
*  Iran. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=38.28s)]
*  Should the U.S. join the fight, intelligence officials told the Times that Iran has prepared [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=39.72s)]
*  missiles for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=44.02s)]
*  In anticipation of that, the Pentagon sent three dozen refueling aircraft to Europe where [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=47.32s)]
*  they can assist fighter jets protecting those bases. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=52.36s)]
*  The most immediate decision for Trump is whether to deploy America's largest conventional [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=55.64s)]
*  weapon, a 30,000 pound bomb called the Massive Ordnance Penetrator. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=59.96s)]
*  Israel has neither the bomb nor the planes heavy enough to carry it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=65.0s)]
*  Instead, it hopes the U.S. can use it to destroy Iran's most heavily fortified nuclear enrichment [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=68.52s)]
*  site, which is buried under a mountain. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=74.08s)]
*  Trump has resisted helping Israel attack the facility. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=76.9s)]
*  He pledged not to bring the U.S. into new wars and has largely pushed for a diplomatic [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=79.78s)]
*  solution in Iran. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  But that may be changing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  He's basically got a choice between going back to the Iranians one more time and saying [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=87.88s)]
*  we made you an offer that would require you to give up all of your nuclear enrichment [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=92.72s)]
*  on Iranian soil, but over time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=99.28s)]
*  My colleague David Sanger covers the White House and national security. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=102.08s)]
*  Or you can ignore the offer, as the Iranians have so far, and he'll say, I'll conduct [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  this military operation. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=112.33999999999999s)]
*  This is called coercive diplomacy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=114.1s)]
*  And I think he may take some time, but not very much time, maybe 24 hours to give them [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  that last chance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  And then I suspect if they turn that down, he will make his move. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=125.46s)]
*  Now, the Iranian system is so dispersed in terms of power between the generals, the ayatollahs, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=130.01999999999998s)]
*  civilian groups, that I don't think they're capable of making that decision in a day or [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=138.1s)]
*  a week or a month. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=143.32s)]
*  So my sense is we kind of know where this may be headed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  I think the president's hope here is you go, you drop your 30,000 pound bombs, you've made [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  your point and you go home. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=154.38s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is the world is rarely that simple. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=156.42s)]
*  The Iranians will have their moment to respond. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  It may be against American bases or troops in the Middle East. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=163.06s)]
*  If any of them are killed, obviously the pressure would be on for a big escalation of the conflict. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=168.34s)]
*  And it would put him in exactly the place where he said he did not want to be. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=174.66s)]
*  For more on Trump's evolution on Iran, listen to White House reporter Jonathan Swan on today's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=180.18s)]
*  episode of The Daily. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=185.18s)]
*  Meanwhile in Gaza. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=192.74s)]
*  Dozens of Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded this week near aid distribution [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=196.26s)]
*  sites according to the local health ministry. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=201.1s)]
*  Gaza officials blame Israel for the deaths and the Israeli military says it's looking [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  into the matter. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=208.1s)]
*  In recent weeks, Israeli soldiers have repeatedly used deadly force to control crowds who they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=209.5s)]
*  say are rushing aid trucks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=214.38s)]
*  This has forced many Gazans to make a choice. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=216.82s)]
*  Let their families go hungry or risk getting shot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=219.42s)]
*  Some Palestinians have told the Times they now won't go back. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=223.3s)]
*  One said, quote, The danger is too high for me. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=226.9s)]
*  I don't want to face death this way. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=229.74s)]
*  In Ukraine, the war there carries on as Russia pummeled Ukraine's capital, Kiev, with drones [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=237.74s)]
*  and missiles on Tuesday. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  It was the deadliest attack in nearly a year, killing 10 people, including a U.S. citizen [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=248.66s)]
*  and wounding at least 100 more. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=253.5s)]
*  Russia has been intensifying its airstrikes against Ukraine in the last few weeks, launching [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=256.26s)]
*  as many drones and missiles in a single night as it did throughout all of June last year. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=260.5s)]
*  The latest attack comes as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to Canada to meet [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=266.46s)]
*  with G7 leaders and push them to hit Russia with tougher sanctions. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=271.04s)]
*  But during the summit, President Trump seemed to blame the war on the G7, criticizing the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=275.46s)]
*  group for expelling Russia over a decade ago after it annexed Crimea. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=280.14s)]
*  Trump said, quote, They should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=284.7s)]
*  at the negotiating table. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=288.58s)]
*  Ultimately, Trump rejected the idea of G7 leaders releasing a joint statement supporting [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=290.34s)]
*  Ukraine, and he left the summit before he was scheduled to meet with Zelensky. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=295.14s)]
*  We are seeing a dramatic increase in threats against senators, congressmen, public officials, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=305.96s)]
*  and throughout America. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=313.78s)]
*  In Washington, members of Congress from both parties are pushing for more security and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=315.46s)]
*  more security funding in the wake of recent attacks in Minnesota against state lawmakers. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=320.06s)]
*  Senators met on Tuesday with a top congressional security official who briefed them on new [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=325.76s)]
*  measures to deal with rising concerns of political violence. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=329.78s)]
*  Last year, Capitol Police investigated more than 9,000 threats against lawmakers, their [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=333.74s)]
*  families and staff, a significant increase from the previous year. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  However, of those thousands of threats, prosecutors secured only eight convictions. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=342.7s)]
*  In the medical world, an unconventional idea, one that's promised to upend our understanding [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=353.54s)]
*  of Alzheimer's, has been spreading. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=358.56s)]
*  It's the focus of television specials, popular podcasts, conferences, self-help books. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=361.2s)]
*  The idea is that lifestyle changes and supplements can not only slow the progression of Alzheimer's, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=366.96s)]
*  but actually reverse it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=372.8s)]
*  The Times spoke with doctors and researchers who study the disease, and they say these [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  big claims have little proof backing them up. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=378.68s)]
*  I've been reporting on a man whose claims about his program have been infuriating the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  medical establishment. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  Lindsay Gelman covers health and has been following a former neurologist at the forefront [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=388.08s)]
*  of this movement, a man named Dale Bredesen. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=392.44s)]
*  His books on Alzheimer's have sold hundreds of thousands of copies, and his program has [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=395.94s)]
*  trained more than 2,000 health practitioners and reached thousands more patients. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  Over eight months, Lindsay followed one couple as the wife, Carrie Briggs, went through Bredesen's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  intensive and expensive program. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=410.32s)]
*  They started last July with a whole regimen of supplements. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=413.08s)]
*  It worked its way up to being about 34 different supplements a day that Carrie was taking. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=417.08s)]
*  After trying all of these different elements of the program, the diet, the hormonal treatments, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  the visits, the supplements, all together, that cost around $25,000. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=428.32s)]
*  They were hoping to see some sort of improvement in her symptoms, but that just wasn't happening. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=435.32s)]
*  If you improve your exercise and diet so that your cardiovascular health improves, you can [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=441.32s)]
*  potentially, according to medical experts, slow down the progression of Alzheimer's symptoms. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=446.84s)]
*  But the experts I spoke to say that's really different than the claim of reversing the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=453.11999999999995s)]
*  underlying physiology of Alzheimer's disease. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=457.76s)]
*  That claim is not supported by the small number of studies that Bredesen has done. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=461.23999999999995s)]
*  There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and seven million Americans have it, which [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=467.23999999999995s)]
*  means that's a really large population of patients that are looking for some sort of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=473.16s)]
*  answer. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=479.08000000000004s)]
*  And when you combine that with the idea that a program is being marketed to patients and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  their loved ones, experts say that you risk offering that vulnerable patient population [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=485.44000000000005s)]
*  false hope. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=490.88s)]
*  And finally, everyone's going to say, well, they're just cheerleaders. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, we're really good cheerleaders. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  The new season of Netflix's hit show, America's Sweethearts about the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=502.94s)]
*  premiered today, and it addresses an issue that's plagued the organization for years. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=507.98s)]
*  How much the cheerleaders get paid. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=512.86s)]
*  A former Cowboys cheerleader sued the team in 2018 over unfair pay, claiming she was [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=515.22s)]
*  paid about $7 an hour with no overtime, plus a $200 per game fee. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=519.92s)]
*  In total, that was less than what the team mascot made. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=525.98s)]
*  And spoiler alert, if you plan on watching Netflix's docu series reveals that the women, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WTy5mfEPJw&t=530.22s)]
