# A Final Week of Campaigning, and Measured Words After Airstrikes on Iran
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Monday, October 28th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=7.76s)]
*  With eight days to go until the election, the race for the presidency remains extraordinarily [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=13.76s)]
*  tight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=18.96s)]
*  The polls show Donald Trump and Kamala Harris effectively tied, and it will be a race to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=19.96s)]
*  the finish for both candidates. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=24.64s)]
*  Yesterday, Trump put on what his team billed as a capstone event for his campaign, though [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  he did not hold it in a battleground state. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=32.12s)]
*  I just want to say a very big hello to a special place, New York, and to an incredible arena, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=34.8s)]
*  Madison Square Garden. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=42.68s)]
*  The Trump team held the rally in Manhattan, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=45.68s)]
*  10 to 1, making the event more about putting on a show than winning over voters. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=50.76s)]
*  Kamala, you're fired. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=56.08s)]
*  Get out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=58.28s)]
*  Get out. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=59.28s)]
*  You're fired. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=60.28s)]
*  For Trump, the importance of this rally was to come back to a city and a state that he [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=62.04s)]
*  feels rejected him and show that he could attract a crowd and fill the stadium. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=68.16s)]
*  Times political reporter Maggie Haberman was at the packed rally, which featured a parade [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=72.96s)]
*  of speakers, including Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and a rare appearance [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=77.36s)]
*  from Trump's wife, Melania. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=82.92s)]
*  Maggie says that Trump's rhetoric has been growing darker in the final weeks of the campaign, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=85.48s)]
*  and that was reflected in the tone of the event overall. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=90.44s)]
*  The content of a number of the speeches leading up to Trump's was pretty inflammatory. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=93.56s)]
*  There were racist comments. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=98.44s)]
*  There were misogynistic comments. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=100.84s)]
*  There was a lot of cursing from one speaker. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=103.0s)]
*  The main person who struck racist notes was a comedian who performed named Tony Hinchcliffe, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=105.98s)]
*  He talked about Puerto Rico as a barge of garbage floating in the ocean and jokes like that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=113.64s)]
*  This is a city with a large Puerto Rican community, and it's almost certain that Kamala Harris's [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=120.96s)]
*  team is going to put those comments into ads for the final days of the race. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=126.16s)]
*  And we'll see if Trump pays any price for it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=131.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris will deliver her own closing arguments tomorrow with a speech [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=134.48s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  In the Middle East this weekend, Israel carried out its long-awaited retaliation against Iran [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  in response to Iran's missile attack earlier this month. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=152.96s)]
*  And for the moment, things are quiet. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=156.28s)]
*  The Israeli strikes destroyed air defense systems near oil refineries, a gas field, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  and a major port. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=163.88000000000002s)]
*  Notably, they did not hit the energy infrastructure itself or any of Iran's nuclear facilities, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=165.68s)]
*  which American officials had urged them to avoid, fearing that it could escalate the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  conflict even further. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=176.28s)]
*  But Times reporter Mark Landler says that, more broadly, America's influence over Israel's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=178.56s)]
*  decision-making has been shrinking. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=184.24s)]
*  I've been talking to former diplomats and analysts from both the United States and Israel [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=186.72s)]
*  over the past couple of days. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  And one thing is very clear. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Where in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s, the United States played really a pivotal role [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=196.84s)]
*  in the Middle East, setting the blueprint for solutions, guiding the course of events, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=204.0s)]
*  in this conflict, the U.S. is not really the pivotal player as it was so much in the past. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=209.0s)]
*  You've seen the United States struggle to persuade the Israelis to allow enough humanitarian [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=215.84s)]
*  aid to flow into Gaza. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=221.76s)]
*  You've seen the Israelis largely rebuff efforts for the United States to broker a ceasefire. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=224.11999999999998s)]
*  They're not the only ones, of course. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=230.48s)]
*  Hamas has been resisting one. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=232.11999999999998s)]
*  And you've also seen Israel escalate exchanges with militants from Hezbollah, expanding this [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=234.32s)]
*  conflict into a sort of a two-front war, which is another thing the U.S. had really, really [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=240.32s)]
*  tried to avoid. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  So in most of the major developments of this conflict, the Israelis have really been setting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=247.32s)]
*  the tone with relatively little regard for the U.S.'s views. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  But even as the U.S.'s influence over events has diminished, you've seen the U.S. get drawn [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=260.88s)]
*  militarily more and more into the conflict. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=267.28s)]
*  The U.S. deployed warships to the Mediterranean. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=270.84s)]
*  Commandos have been deployed to help look for hostages. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=274.12s)]
*  You've seen the United States play a major role in helping the Israelis shoot down ballistic [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  missiles that were fired by Iran into Israel. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=283.56s)]
*  So across the board, you're seeing more and more of an American military role in a regional [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=287.08s)]
*  war over which it doesn't seem to have that much strategic and long-term influence. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=294.32s)]
*  California used to be the place to film for TV and movies. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=304.08s)]
*  It has the studios, the sun, the whole Hollywood infrastructure. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=315.88s)]
*  But for the past 20 years, other states have been chipping away at that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  Almost 40 states have rolled out tax incentives to lure productions. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  Check the credits and you'll see Georgia, Louisiana, and New York as the locations for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=329.26s)]
*  everything from Marvel movies to indie dramas. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=333.62s)]
*  But this weekend, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a proposal to fight back. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=336.94s)]
*  He wants to more than double the state's film tax incentive program to $750 million. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=342.22s)]
*  The industry as a whole has been struggling to bounce back from recent writers and actors [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  strikes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=353.42s)]
*  And there are fears that new technology like AI could also threaten Hollywood work. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=354.5s)]
*  Newsom said he hopes the program will generate thousands of jobs in California. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=359.46s)]
*  But tax incentives for the film industry often cost more than their worth. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=364.26s)]
*  Study after study has found that for every dollar spent on the tax breaks, states get [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=369.46s)]
*  as little as a quarter or even just a dime back in revenue. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=374.28s)]
*  And finally, this spring, a museum curator in Manhattan was sifting through a collection [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=384.46s)]
*  of papers, some postcards from Picasso, that kind of thing, when he came across a scrap [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=389.34s)]
*  of sheet music the size of an index card. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=394.44s)]
*  On the top was a very famous name dashed off in cursive. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  Chopin. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=402.62s)]
*  The scrap appears to be an otherwise unknown waltz by the composer, Frederic Chopin, who [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=406.2s)]
*  died almost 175 years ago. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=410.94s)]
*  The pianist Long Long performed the waltz for the Times, possibly the first time it's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=416.42s)]
*  ever been played for the public. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=421.38s)]
*  There's a history in classical music of fakes and forgeries and long lost pieces emerging [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  out of nowhere. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=432.94s)]
*  But the penmanship matches and there are little drawings on the page, which fits. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=433.94s)]
*  Chopin liked to doodle. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=438.82s)]
*  It's not clear what the composer himself would make of anyone playing this waltz now. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=441.98s)]
*  He often covered up his drafts with furious scribbles or blacked them out with ink. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=446.82s)]
*  And he told his friends that he wanted his unpublished works to be destroyed after his [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=451.54s)]
*  death. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=468.58000000000004s)]
*  Today on The Daily, inside Donald Trump's unorthodox campaign to win over voters in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=470.14s)]
*  battleground states. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=475.76s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=478.02s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=483.14s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igbg_3pvwMU&t=484.14s)]
