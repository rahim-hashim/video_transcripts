# How DOGE Hides Its Work, and Trump Targets Climate Rules
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=4.68s)]
*  Today's Thursday, March 13. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=5.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=8.24s)]
*  Today I'm pleased to make the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=13.88s)]
*  The Environmental Protection Agency is initiating 31 historic actions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=19.84s)]
*  Lee Zeldin, head of the EPA, has announced that the Trump administration's repealing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=24.12s)]
*  dozens of the country's most consequential environmental policies, from its limits on [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=28.68s)]
*  pollution from cars and factories to its protections for wetlands. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=33.84s)]
*  EPA will be reconsidering many suffocating rules that restrict nearly every sector of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=38.2s)]
*  our economy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=43.92s)]
*  Most significantly, Zeldin wants to undercut the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=45.4s)]
*  gas emissions at all. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=50.08s)]
*  To do that, the agency will have to argue that those emissions pose no foreseeable threat [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=52.16s)]
*  to public health, going against decades of science that show otherwise. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=57.12s)]
*  Yesterday's announcement underscores the administration's approach to climate science. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=62.68s)]
*  For years now, President Trump has disputed the science of climate change and made it [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=67.16s)]
*  clear that he has very little interest in supporting a transition to an economy powered [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=73.12s)]
*  by renewable energy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  My colleague David Gellis covers climate policy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=80.6s)]
*  We even saw during his campaign last year, he went to Houston and asked a group of oil [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=83.22s)]
*  and gas executives to raise a billion dollars for him with the promise that he would then [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=89.64s)]
*  strip away regulations in order to help their business. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=94.94s)]
*  Now the final figure was closer to 75 million roughly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=99.36s)]
*  Nevertheless, President Trump is now making good on that promise to create a series of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=103.25999999999999s)]
*  policy moves that are really detrimental to the clean energy business and quite favorable [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=109.54s)]
*  to the fossil fuel industry. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=117.14s)]
*  We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=125.58000000000001s)]
*  Since President Trump took office, his administration and its allies have been boasting about the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=130.3s)]
*  huge savings they say they're bringing for American taxpayers. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=135.18s)]
*  This is a $3.4 million contract, a council for inclusive innovation at the U.S. Patent [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=138.92s)]
*  and Trademark Office, another DEI contract that Doge identified. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=145.82s)]
*  At the center of that effort has been Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=149.94s)]
*  And we bring the receipts. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  So people say like, well, is this real? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=156.14s)]
*  Just go to doge.gov. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=157.94s)]
*  Musk promised that the effort to cut government spending would be, quote, maximally transparent. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  But as Doge has posted what it calls a wall of receipts to its website, the Times has [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=166.14s)]
*  found the data has been riddled with errors, like confusing billions with millions or triple [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=171.27999999999997s)]
*  counting a single contract. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  And now amid increased questions about its work, my colleagues have found that Doge has [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=179.32s)]
*  made it harder to track exactly what it's doing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=184.42s)]
*  Before when Doge celebrated the cuts it made, it would post details about what it had cut. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=188.22s)]
*  It would post the name of the contractor whose contract had been cut and it would post [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=193.44s)]
*  an ID number so you could go back and look up that specific contract in federal contracting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=197.84s)]
*  databases. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=203.1s)]
*  What they've done now is to start posting new claims, new savings they say they've achieved [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=204.48s)]
*  without that kind of detail. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=211.14s)]
*  David Ferenthold is an investigative reporter at the Times. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=213.24s)]
*  Here's why this is important. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=216.52s)]
*  Doge is making a generational overhaul in how the government works. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=218.48s)]
*  And there's only one place where they show their work, this website. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  The concern now is that that one little window they provided into their work is closing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=226.17999999999998s)]
*  What they're doing is providing uncheckable data and removing the opportunity for the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=231.7s)]
*  public to try to verify their claims. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  Now three quick updates on stories we've been covering. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=246.48s)]
*  Sending the government should be a bipartisan effort. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=250.36s)]
*  But Republicans chose a partisan path without any input from congressional Democrats. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=254.24s)]
*  Senate Democrats say they will refuse to vote for a Republican-led funding bill. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=261.08000000000004s)]
*  That makes a government shutdown tomorrow at midnight significantly more likely. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=266.1s)]
*  The Democrats say they've had to weigh two bad options. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=270.88s)]
*  If they were to go along with the Republican plan, they'd face backlash from constituents [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=274.6s)]
*  who want them to stand up to the Republicans' agenda. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=279.22s)]
*  But if they vote to block the spending bill as they're currently planning to, they risk [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=282.14s)]
*  taking the blame for the disruption of a shutdown. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  Also, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=289.82s)]
*  Every day that Mahmoud spends in detention in Louisiana is a day too long. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=290.82s)]
*  Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate who was arrested by immigration officers, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=296.1s)]
*  spoke outside the first court hearing in his case yesterday to denounce the government's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=301.82s)]
*  plan to deport him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=306.42s)]
*  Khalil's a legal permanent resident and hasn't been charged with any crime. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=308.42s)]
*  But the Trump administration claims he sided with terrorists when he protested the war [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=313.14s)]
*  in Gaza and has said it wants to revoke his green card. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=317.3s)]
*  At the hearing, his legal team told a judge that they hadn't been able to talk with Khalil [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  in private since he was arrested over the weekend. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=325.42s)]
*  And new economic data shows that prices did not jump as much for U.S. consumers last month [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=329.22s)]
*  as some analysts had expected. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  Instead, inflation eased a little overall. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=336.46s)]
*  But prices for some staples, like groceries, are still rising sharply. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=339.54s)]
*  Egg prices in particular continue to soar. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=344.14s)]
*  They cost about 60% more than they did a year ago, largely due to an ongoing outbreak of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=347.02s)]
*  bird flu. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=352.3s)]
*  An explosive new memoir about working at Facebook has set off a legal battle. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=353.3s)]
*  Sarah Wynn Williams worked at the company from 2011 to 2017 before it changed its name [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=368.02000000000004s)]
*  to Metta. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=373.18s)]
*  It was a pivotal period when Facebook was becoming one of the most influential and frequently [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=374.38s)]
*  used platforms on the planet. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=378.8s)]
*  In her book, Careless People, which came out this week, she describes the company's executives, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, as status-obsessed and self-absorbed. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=386.58s)]
*  On a tour Zuckerberg took through Asia, Wynn Williams says she was told to somehow gather [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=391.98s)]
*  a crowd of more than a million people to mark his visit. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=396.74s)]
*  For Sandberg, the book claims she and her assistant would take turns sleeping in each [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=400.36s)]
*  other's laps and stroking each other's hair. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=404.74s)]
*  The book also details how Facebook struggled to wield its growing power, especially when [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=407.86s)]
*  it came to content moderation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=412.92s)]
*  For example, Wynn Williams says the company was unprepared to handle a surge of hate speech [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=415.1s)]
*  on the platform that ultimately helped incite a genocide in Myanmar. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=419.7s)]
*  The Times Review called the whole book, quote, genuinely shocking, an ugly detailed portrait [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  of one of the most powerful companies in the world. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  Metta has vehemently denied the allegations in the book, and the company's arguing that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=433.5s)]
*  Wynn Williams violated the non-despairagement contract she signed when she worked there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=437.78s)]
*  Yesterday, an arbitrator ordered her to stop promoting and distributing copies. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=442.85999999999996s)]
*  The decision does not appear to limit the publisher from continuing to sell the book. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=447.82s)]
*  And finally, the company that owns Pokemon Go, the runaway hit game that once had the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=460.5s)]
*  whole world nerding out, announced it will be sold to a company owned by a Saudi Arabian [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=465.42s)]
*  wealth fund. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=470.82s)]
*  Pokemon Go became a cultural phenomenon when it first launched. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=472.3s)]
*  The augmented reality game sent people running around the streets, even onto private property, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=475.82s)]
*  trying to capture cartoon monsters on their phones. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=480.74s)]
*  It's still popular, with 20 million active players each week. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=484.06s)]
*  Now it will be part of the vast portfolio owned by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=488.14s)]
*  As part of its plan to diversify its economy beyond oil, the Saudi government has said [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=493.62s)]
*  it will invest $38 billion in video games by 2030. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=498.46s)]
*  The plan mirrors what the country's done with sports, buying into soccer teams and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=503.76s)]
*  launching its own golf league. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  Critics have said the investments are part of an effort to polish the country's reputation [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  after accusations of human rights abuses. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=515.14s)]
*  First they say it was sports washing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=518.22s)]
*  Now it's games washing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=520.1s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=524.58s)]
*  Today on The Daily, how President Trump's aggressive stance towards Canada has riled [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=526.58s)]
*  up Canadians. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=531.94s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=532.94s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=537.9000000000001s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_Y-5dc9lc&t=539.1s)]
