# Israelis Go On Strike After Hostage Deaths, and German Far Right Makes Election Gains
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=4.96s)]
*  Today is Monday, September 2nd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=8.4s)]
*  Israel is in the middle of a labor strike this morning as protesters demand that the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=14.56s)]
*  government reach a ceasefire deal. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=18.34s)]
*  Many schools and businesses are closed, some hospitals have cut services, and all early [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=21.32s)]
*  flights out of the Tel Aviv airport were canceled. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=26.32s)]
*  The strikers are calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a truce in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=29.68s)]
*  order to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=34.76s)]
*  The uproar has been spreading since the Israeli military announced this weekend that it found [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=39.08s)]
*  the bodies of six hostages in tunnels underneath the city of Rafa. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=42.84s)]
*  Israel says they were killed by Hamas shortly before soldiers reached them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=47.88s)]
*  Last night, massive protests filled the streets over the idea they could have been saved by [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=51.2s)]
*  a ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=59.32s)]
*  We demand the deal to be right now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=61.32s)]
*  That's why we're marching for, that's what we're shouting for. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=64.12s)]
*  The mood in Israel is generally somber and also angry as we witness what amounts to the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=67.17999999999999s)]
*  biggest expression of dissent against the government since the war started. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=75.24s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley is the Jerusalem bureau chief for the Times. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=80.4s)]
*  Many Israelis are furious that Hamas has killed six hostages in captivity in recent [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=83.88s)]
*  days. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=91.44s)]
*  And in addition to blaming Hamas for that, they blame their government, in particular [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=92.44s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for failing to compromise enough in ceasefire negotiations [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  with Hamas in order to secure a ceasefire deal in which many of the remaining hostages [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=104.6s)]
*  in Gaza were expected to be released. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=110.88s)]
*  It remains to be seen how much this will affect Prime Minister Netanyahu's thinking. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=113.84s)]
*  The protesters are basically saying that Israel cannot wait for the perfect ceasefire deal [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  and that it's better to make a quick compromise in order to save the lives of the remaining [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=124.08s)]
*  hostages than to hold out for the kind of ceasefire deal that would make it a lot harder [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=129.0s)]
*  for Hamas to survive the war as a functioning movement. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=135.68s)]
*  On the other hand, Prime Minister Netanyahu and his supporters feel that it's better [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=140.6s)]
*  to hold out for a better deal in order to weaken Hamas than it is to agree a flawed [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=146.4s)]
*  deal that would save the lives of a few dozen hostages. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=153.24s)]
*  The hostages who were found dead in Gaza include Hirsch Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old Israeli [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  American citizen who was abducted from a music festival on October 7th. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=166.88s)]
*  His parents campaigned widely for his release, and they spoke at the Democratic National [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=172.04s)]
*  Convention last month. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=176.68s)]
*  After his death was announced, Kamala Harris released a statement saying that, quote, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=179.44s)]
*  The threat Hamas poses to the people of Israel and American citizens in Israel must be eliminated, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=183.44s)]
*  and Hamas cannot control Gaza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=190.34s)]
*  Harris and President Biden are expected to meet this morning at the White House with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  the American negotiators who have been participating in the ceasefire talks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=197.24s)]
*  In Germany yesterday, a far-right party, the AfD, made major gains in state elections. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=207.24s)]
*  It won one state outright, the first time since the Nazi era that a far-right party [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  has done that in Germany. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=219.08s)]
*  Branches of the party have been classified by intelligence agencies as, quote, confirmed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=221.88s)]
*  extremists, based on their outspoken Islamophobia and defamation of state institutions. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  But the AfD's been gathering support with its calls for cracking down on immigration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=232.92s)]
*  and cutting off military support for Ukraine. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=237.32s)]
*  Its surge in popularity in recent years has been shifting the political conversation in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  Germany. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  Mainstream politicians have been taking a harsher stance towards immigration and calling [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=247.11999999999998s)]
*  it for tougher asylum laws. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=251.36s)]
*  A Times investigation has found that one of the largest chains of psychiatric hospitals [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=261.0s)]
*  in the U.S. has been holding patients against their will to maximize profits. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  Acadia Healthcare operates in 19 states, and there have been dozens of reports of the hospitals [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=271.6s)]
*  detaining patients using laws meant for people who pose an imminent threat, even when they [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=277.8s)]
*  didn't meet that legal standard. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=283.2s)]
*  Times investigative reporter Katie Thomas and her colleagues spoke to Acadia patients, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=286.08s)]
*  as well as more than 50 staff members. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=291.12s)]
*  What we learned from speaking to these current and former employees was that it was very [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=293.8s)]
*  important to Acadia to keep these facilities full. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=297.36s)]
*  They call that heads and beds. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=302.08s)]
*  It was the norm to not discharge a patient until their insurance had run out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=304.24s)]
*  So it wasn't really a question about whether somebody was medically ready to leave or psychologically [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=309.52s)]
*  ready to leave. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=315.24s)]
*  It was a question about how much more time would the insurance cover. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=316.72s)]
*  Katie says that Acadia has used an array of strategies to keep patients in their facilities. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=321.32s)]
*  The staff has exaggerated patient symptoms, used buzzwords like combative or uncooperative [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=327.36s)]
*  on medical records, and said patients need to be detained for things like skipping group [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  therapy or not finishing a meal. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  One woman in Florida was sent from a hospital to an Acadia facility after she tried to get [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  her prescriptions for bipolar disorder evaluated. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=346.88000000000005s)]
*  Acadia held her for six days, even though she begged to be released, and her medical [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  records said she wasn't a danger to herself or others. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=355.24s)]
*  Her mother told the Times she's now terrified of trying to get medical help because she [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=359.1s)]
*  doesn't want to be trapped again. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=363.16s)]
*  Acadia charged her insurance $13,200 for the stay. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=365.4s)]
*  Acadia is really indicative of this major shift that has occurred in mental health care [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=370.6s)]
*  over the past decade or so, where traditionally governments or nonprofit organizations had [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  run psychiatric hospitals. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=382.08s)]
*  But increasingly today, they're being run by large for-profit companies like Acadia. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  One of the major things that has been driving that in the last 10 years is the Affordable [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=390.08s)]
*  Care Act, which required insurers to cover mental health care. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=394.52s)]
*  When that happened, a lot of for-profit companies saw an opportunity there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=398.68s)]
*  And especially in recent years, as we've seen this kind of surge, this new mental health [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=403.24s)]
*  crisis, hospitals have been really overwhelmed with people in their emergency departments. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=408.52s)]
*  So Acadia pitched itself as available to help hospitals relieve this kind of overcrowding [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=415.56s)]
*  and to provide a solution that could help these patients. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=423.88s)]
*  In response to questions from the Times, an Acadia spokesman said, quote, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=427.28000000000003s)]
*  Any incident that falls short of our rigorous standards is unacceptable, and that the examples [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=431.8s)]
*  of mistreatment the Times found were not representative. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=437.36s)]
*  Earlier this year, Acadia said it had tentatively agreed to settle a Justice Department [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=441.04s)]
*  investigation into its practices. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=445.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, Acadia's stock price has been rising. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=447.8s)]
*  It's now valued at about $7 billion. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=451.52s)]
*  And finally, we've entered a coffee shop arms race. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=460.24s)]
*  Across the country, stores that specialize in coffee and tea drinks are one of the fastest [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=464.24s)]
*  growing segments of the entire restaurant industry. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=468.88s)]
*  And it's not just Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts expanding. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  Smaller regional chains are also making a play, especially in the Midwest and South, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  which weren't as saturated with options. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  For example, Dunn Brothers says it's blanketing the I-35 corridor from Minnesota to Texas. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=482.68s)]
*  And in Tyler, Texas, there were just 17 coffee shops a few years ago. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=489.12s)]
*  Now there's more than 50. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=493.8s)]
*  And the shops aren't trying to win the coffee wars with just black coffee. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  Most of their sales growth is coming from iced drinks. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=500.48s)]
*  That's syrupy, foamy, cookie-flavored lattes, fruit smoothies, and other creations that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=503.76s)]
*  feel like a Willy Wonka caffeinated fever dream. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=508.92s)]
*  Consider a white chocolate pumpkin energy drink or a funnel cake macchiato. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=512.36s)]
*  Some of the chains say they're ready to go head-to-head with Starbucks, though analysts [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=518.04s)]
*  point out that might be a tough battle. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=522.88s)]
*  Starbucks already has more than 16,000 locations across the U.S. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=525.32s)]
*  That's more than the next 10 biggest coffee chains combined. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=530.5200000000001s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=535.96s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=537.44s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1g5l6RKbqY&t=538.44s)]
