# Jimmy Carter Dies at 100, and Questions Surround South Korean Plane Crash
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Monday, December 30th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=7.76s)]
*  Jimmy Carter, the longest living president in American history, has died after nearly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=13.88s)]
*  two years in hospice care. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=18.88s)]
*  He was 100 years old. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  World leaders and others are remembering Carter this morning as a dedicated humanitarian and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=23.32s)]
*  a global statesman who pushed for peace and democracy around the globe. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=27.88s)]
*  Jimmy Carter from Georgia. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=32.4s)]
*  I hope to be the next president. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=33.6s)]
*  Carter's path to the presidency began on a peanut farm in Georgia, where he was raised [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  with no electricity or running water. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=39.84s)]
*  He served in the Navy and as governor of his home state before launching his campaign for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=42.2s)]
*  the White House. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=46.84s)]
*  He was elected in 1976, just two years after President Richard Nixon resigned in a maelstrom [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=48.08s)]
*  of scandal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=54.2s)]
*  I came along at a time when Americans still remembered painfully the lies told and the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=55.2s)]
*  debacle of Watergate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=62.28s)]
*  In 2006, Carter spoke with the Times about his presidency in footage that was released [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  after his death. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=68.68s)]
*  I brought a fresh face of a peanut farmer, a working man, who's for never to tell a lie [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=69.68s)]
*  or make a misleading statement. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=76.04s)]
*  Carter went into his presidency hoping he could be a breath of fresh air in American [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  politics. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=82.08s)]
*  But he faced a tumultuous landscape navigating a domestic energy crisis and soaring inflation. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=83.08s)]
*  Abroad, he negotiated a nuclear agreement with Russia. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=89.08s)]
*  He brokered peace between Egypt and Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=92.6s)]
*  But the chaos of the Iran hostage crisis defined the end of his presidency. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=95.12s)]
*  Militants stormed the American embassy in Tehran and dozens of hostages weren't released [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=100.52s)]
*  until hours after Carter left office. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=105.24s)]
*  He served only one term and went out as one of the most unpopular presidents in modern [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=108.72s)]
*  times. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  But his long career after his presidency reshaped his legacy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=115.16s)]
*  He and his wife Rosalind Carter, who died last year, were huge proponents of habitat [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=120.6s)]
*  for humanity. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=125.24s)]
*  They were often seen outbuilding houses. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=126.24s)]
*  And he continued to help mediate conflicts around the world and pushed for human rights, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=128.56s)]
*  earning him the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=133.64s)]
*  In his interview with the Times, Carter laid out his hope for what America could become. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=136.11999999999998s)]
*  I would like to see our country be the champion of human rights. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=141.04s)]
*  And every American embassy looked upon as a haven for those who suffer from human rights [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  abuse. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=148.32s)]
*  I'd like to see our country be the most generous on earth. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=149.32s)]
*  A state funeral for Carter will be held next week at the National Cathedral in Washington, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=152.16s)]
*  D.C. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=158.12s)]
*  For more on Carter's presidency and legacy, listen to today's episode of The Daily with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=159.16s)]
*  The Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=164.04s)]
*  In South Korea, investigators are looking into what caused the fatal plane crash there [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=171.0s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=175.84s)]
*  All but two of the 181 people on board were killed when the plane, which took off from [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=177.2s)]
*  Thailand, crashed at the airport in the city of Muang. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=182.16s)]
*  Video of the crash shows the plane barreling down the runway without its landing gear down. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=186.68s)]
*  The plane then hit a concrete barrier, bursting into flames. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=192.04s)]
*  For some experts in crash investigations, the footage raises more questions than it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=197.32s)]
*  answers. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=201.76s)]
*  The pilots should have received an alert that the landing gear wasn't down. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=202.92s)]
*  And that model of plane, a Boeing 737-800, has a backup system that allows the pilots [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=207.16s)]
*  to manually release the wheels if needed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=212.6s)]
*  Experts say the footage raises other questions. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=216.04s)]
*  A reverse thruster used to slow planes down during landing appears to only be in use on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=218.4s)]
*  one engine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=223.12s)]
*  And the flaps and slats on the plane's wings, which are also used to slow it down, do not [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=224.56s)]
*  appear to be extended. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=228.96s)]
*  Officials in South Korea are looking at multiple factors in the crash, including if birds hit [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=231.16000000000003s)]
*  the jet. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  Investigators say they've recovered the plane's black boxes, but they say it will likely take [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=236.52s)]
*  months to determine the official cause of the crash. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, officials in Azerbaijan are blaming Russia for a deadly plane crash on Christmas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=248.84s)]
*  An Azerbaijan Airlines jet bound for southern Russia crashed, killing 38 people. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=254.84s)]
*  Azerbaijani and U.S. officials, as well as aviation experts, have said they believe the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=260.0s)]
*  plane was most likely shot down by a Russian air defense missile. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=265.24s)]
*  The Kremlin remained silent about the crash for three days before Russian President Vladimir [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=269.76s)]
*  Putin called the president of Azerbaijan and apologized without acknowledging responsibility. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=274.16s)]
*  Russia has said its air defense systems were fending off an attack by Ukrainian drones [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=280.36s)]
*  near the airport where the plane was supposed to land. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  But Azerbaijan's president says Russia needs to publicly admit it caused the crash and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  compensate the victims' families. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=293.36s)]
*  With less than a month until Donald Trump takes office, some of his closest advisors [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=295.2s)]
*  are having a fiery public debate about immigration policy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=305.56s)]
*  Specifically, H-1B visas, which let tens of thousands of skilled foreign workers, like [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=309.84s)]
*  software engineers, enter the U.S. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=315.8s)]
*  The tech industry in particular has long relied on the visas. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  The H-1B visa program is a total and complete scam concocted by the lords of easy money [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=322.0s)]
*  on Wall Street in the oligarchs in Silicon Valley. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=329.92s)]
*  Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump ally, has joined a chorus of right-wing voices condemning the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=333.84s)]
*  program. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=338.84s)]
*  He claims that it, along with other visas for immigrant workers, drive down wages for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=339.88s)]
*  Americans while increasing profits for companies. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=344.48s)]
*  They promise to push to roll them back. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=347.56s)]
*  We're not going to take the temperature down. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=350.36s)]
*  Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=351.48s)]
*  There's no backing down. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=354.0s)]
*  It's doubling down. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=355.32s)]
*  On the other side, Elon Musk, who's been working closely with Trump, has vigorously defended [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=357.0s)]
*  H-1B visas, arguing that the expertise U.S. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=362.12s)]
*  companies need, quote, simply does not exist in America in sufficient quantity. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  Musk himself had an H-1B visa before he became a U.S. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=370.44s)]
*  citizen, and his company Tesla brought in more than 700 workers under the program this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=373.32s)]
*  year. Over the weekend, Trump was asked where he [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=378.24s)]
*  stands on the issue. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=381.32s)]
*  He called himself a believer in H-1B, but didn't clarify whether or not his administration [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=382.88s)]
*  will continue the program. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=387.68s)]
*  New data shows that the number of murders in the U.S. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=398.64s)]
*  this year has dropped. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=401.48s)]
*  Major cities, including Chicago, Detroit, and San Francisco, have all seen a decline [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=403.28s)]
*  in homicides. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=407.36s)]
*  According to information collected by the FBI, the cities and researchers, the data [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=409.08s)]
*  is preliminary and doesn't cover the full year yet, but it suggests that the murder [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=413.56s)]
*  rate, which spiked during the pandemic, is continuing to go down. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  Local officials say that targeted efforts, like violence intervention programs in areas [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=422.32s)]
*  with frequent shootings, have helped drive down the numbers. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=426.36s)]
*  Apart from homicides, some other crimes have also declined, including car thefts and aggravated [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=430.44s)]
*  assaults. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  Still, some Americans may not be feeling safer. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=436.8s)]
*  According to a Gallup poll from October, about a quarter of Americans say crime is an extremely [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  serious problem. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=445.04s)]
*  Criminal justice experts say that what people see on the streets, like shoplifting and public [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  drug use, is contributing to a disconnect between how safe Americans are and how safe [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  they feel. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=456.8s)]
*  And finally, coffee drinkers, brace yourselves for prices to soar. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=457.8s)]
*  Wholesale coffee prices are trading near a 50-year high. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=469.2s)]
*  One factor is extreme weather. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=472.86s)]
*  Coffee beans can only be grown under very specific circumstances. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=474.92s)]
*  The plants need misty, humid, tropical climates, and some of the limited areas where those [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=478.48s)]
*  conditions exist, like in Brazil and Vietnam, have been hit with severe droughts in the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=482.88s)]
*  past year. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjX9vNMdGdc&t=487.36s)]
