# Trump Threatens More News Outlets, and Injuries at Amazon's Warehouses
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Monday, December 16th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=6.36s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=8.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and his allies have been issuing a flurry of legal threats, apparently aimed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=14.08s)]
*  at intimidating news outlets over their coverage of the president-elect and of his proposed [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=19.12s)]
*  cabinet members. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=24.44s)]
*  This October, Trump sued CBS News over how it edited a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=26.22s)]
*  Harris. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=31.939999999999998s)]
*  Just before Election Day, a lawyer for Trump accused the New York Times of publishing three [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=33.379999999999995s)]
*  articles that were, quote, deceptive, and demanded a retraction and an apology. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=37.92s)]
*  The bar for public figures to win defamation cases in the U.S. is extremely high, but even [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=43.5s)]
*  filing or just threatening to file a suit can pay off. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=48.82s)]
*  This Saturday, ABC News said it had agreed to settle a defamation suit that Trump brought [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=52.66s)]
*  after one of its anchors inaccurately said Trump was held liable for rape in a civil [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=57.54s)]
*  trial. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  In fact, he was found liable for sexual abuse. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  The settlement followed months of Trump publicly attacking ABC News, going so far as to suggest [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=66.12s)]
*  it should lose its federal broadcast license. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=71.69999999999999s)]
*  Some legal and media experts now wonder if the settlement could embolden Trump and others [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=75.17999999999999s)]
*  to intensify their assaults on the media even more. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=79.94s)]
*  Beyond Trump himself, his pick for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has also been warning [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=83.58s)]
*  journalists about potential lawsuits. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=88.82s)]
*  Hegseth's lawyer warned Vanity Fair and The New Yorker that articles they were planning [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=91.5s)]
*  to publish about his past, including drinking and marital problems, could be defamatory. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=95.74s)]
*  Hegseth has denied having a drinking problem. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=101.1s)]
*  Both outlets still publish the stories. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=103.94s)]
*  Once in the White House, Trump and his team will have more powers at their disposal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=107.02s)]
*  They've discussed issuing subpoenas for news organizations, prosecuting journalists and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=111.5s)]
*  their sources, and cutting funding for public media. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=115.94s)]
*  Just over a week after the dictator Bashar al-Assad was thrown out of power, a crucial [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=126.38s)]
*  question has been hanging over Syria. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=131.1s)]
*  How will the rebels who took power actually run the country? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=133.9s)]
*  The group that ousted Assad, Hayat-e-Hir al-Sham, used to have ties to the Islamic State and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=137.82s)]
*  al-Qaeda, but then grew more moderate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=142.82s)]
*  My colleague Neil McFarquhar has been looking at the small chunk of the country that the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=145.18s)]
*  groups controlled in recent years for clues about how it may approach running all of Syria. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=148.9s)]
*  Around 2016, they broke with these extremist groups entirely and set up a government of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=154.9s)]
*  their own that was still conservative in terms of enforcing Islamic law, but not brutal. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=161.38s)]
*  They were much more pragmatic. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=168.38s)]
*  Things like alcohol was not for sale, but they didn't enforce punishments like whipping [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=170.66s)]
*  for adultery or getting your hand chopped off if you were convicted of being a thief. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=175.38s)]
*  The core of the group focused on creating an army while they also set up a civil administration [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=181.02s)]
*  that kind of ran day-to-day life in the territory. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=188.14s)]
*  They collected taxes, they set up distribution of electricity and water and cell phone service. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=191.61999999999998s)]
*  So they managed to create a certain stability within the region. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=196.89999999999998s)]
*  At the same time, there was an authoritarian element to the administration because they [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=202.14s)]
*  jailed their critics. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=207.14s)]
*  There were often protests about the harsh conditions in jails. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  And of course, there's always a lingering suspicion that because their roots are in the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=212.78s)]
*  more extremist jihadist groups that somewhere bubbling beneath the surface, that ideology [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=217.34s)]
*  might still emerge. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=223.22s)]
*  Although one analyst I talked to suggested that they should be judged on the last eight [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  years when they kind of ran a pragmatic administration rather than the previous five when they had [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  been a jihadist organization. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  The Senate Labor Committee, led by Bernie Sanders, has released an investigation it [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=242.98s)]
*  says shows Amazon ignored recommendations from its staff about how to keep its warehouse [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=247.17999999999998s)]
*  workers safe. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=252.26s)]
*  The committee got access to an internal Amazon study that looked at its productivity quotas. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=253.78s)]
*  For instance, how many items workers are expected to pick off shelves. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=259.14s)]
*  It found that higher quotas led to higher rates of injuries and recommended relaxing [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=262.98s)]
*  enforcement of the quotas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=267.68s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=269.76s)]
*  The investigation found evidence suggesting senior executives at the company rejected [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=270.92s)]
*  the recommendation because they were worried it would lower productivity. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=275.1s)]
*  In response to the Senate's findings, an Amazon spokeswoman said the investigation [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=278.92s)]
*  was highlighting out-of-date research. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  A later report Amazon conducted disputed the link between quotas and injuries and determined [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=285.56s)]
*  that some workers were just more prone to getting injured. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=290.76s)]
*  The Senate investigation also found the company discourages injured workers from getting appropriate [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=294.04s)]
*  medical care outside the warehouse. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=298.76s)]
*  It sends them to on-site facilities that only offer basic first aid. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  Amazon has also denied that claim. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=305.65999999999997s)]
*  The Times has been looking at a troubling trend in American schools. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=319.4s)]
*  Cell phones and social media are making fights between students more common and more violent. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=323.4s)]
*  You know, students are having a quarrel and then 30 kids take their phones out and the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=328.76s)]
*  kids are having a verbal spat, then feel the pressure to save face and they start physically [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=335.8s)]
*  assaulting one another because the cameras are out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  And then you have kids trying to rush out of their classroom down the stairs to watch [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=344.96s)]
*  it, film it, comment on it and share it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  And it becomes a kind of reinforcing negative vicious cycle. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=350.28s)]
*  My colleague Natasha Singer has reviewed hundreds of videos the kids have posted from school [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=354.52s)]
*  schools all over the country and talked to administrators, teachers and students. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=358.72s)]
*  She says fights at school are not a new problem by any means and posting fights to social [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  media isn't even new either. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  There are even dedicated accounts that show nothing but school fights. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  But she says it's gotten worse in the past few years. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=374.68s)]
*  Students are more attached to their phones than ever and there's been a rise in emotional [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=378.16s)]
*  issues and aggression after pandemic lockdowns. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=382.04s)]
*  Students and the videos of them have been surging and schools are having trouble keeping up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  We found that students are moving to much more private channels, that they are using [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  iMessage to text each other the fight videos. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=395.12s)]
*  They're using AirDrop to send kids in schools the location of the fight or where they plan [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  to assault someone. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=403.68s)]
*  And then they're sharing it via text message or they're sharing the videos via Snap. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=405.06s)]
*  And so it makes it much harder for teachers and school administrators and school police [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=409.56s)]
*  officers to stop the fights because all of this stuff is now happening much more [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=414.44s)]
*  underground than it was. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=420.04s)]
*  The consequences are not just immediate. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=421.92s)]
*  The fights live on on the phones and it becomes part of school culture. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=425.36s)]
*  The kids ask each other, do you have the video? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=430.4s)]
*  They watch the videos together. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=433.12s)]
*  They post comments on the videos, which can further humiliate the victim. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=434.36s)]
*  And then they keep them around for a while. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=438.12s)]
*  So when there's another fight, you can compare today's fight to the video of the fight three [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=439.64s)]
*  months ago or three years ago. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=443.36s)]
*  And it never goes away. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=445.2s)]
*  And so it has, in a sense, made certain students feel less safe in school. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  It really detracted from learning. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=452.04s)]
*  And many school administrators and teachers we spoke to said they felt like it made it [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  much, much harder for them to do their jobs because it took time away from operating the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  school and teaching in the classroom. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=464.92s)]
*  And finally, when you buy a sealed pack of trading cards, whether it's Pokemon cards, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=473.36s)]
*  baseball cards, they're supposed to be an air of mystery to it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=478.36s)]
*  You don't know what's inside. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=481.96000000000004s)]
*  There could be a super valuable rare card or it could be something that you've already [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=483.48s)]
*  got 20 of. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=487.16s)]
*  Now, one company is offering a way to take some of the guesswork out and it could disrupt [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=488.64s)]
*  the whole industry. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=493.48s)]
*  Industrial Inspection and Consulting in Michigan realized it could use the cash to buy [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=495.16s)]
*  Industrial Inspection and Consulting in Michigan realized it could use the CAT scan [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=499.88s)]
*  machinery it normally uses on machine parts to peer behind the trading card packaging. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=504.08s)]
*  It's probably not the first to come up with the idea, but it is the first to widely [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=509.52s)]
*  advertise the service. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=513.16s)]
*  Collectors and sellers can now scan their inventory to help figure out whether there's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=514.96s)]
*  something in the pack worth ripping it open for or whether they can safely sell it on to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygkmZSXRSg&t=519.12s)]
