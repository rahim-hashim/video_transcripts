# The Who’s Who of Trump’s Staff Picks, and Bitcoin and Stocks Set Records
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, November [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=0.0s)]
*  12th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=7.4s)]
*  A flurry of appointments is underway for Donald Trump's second term. The Times has gotten [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=13.88s)]
*  details on who's been picked for what in the last 24 hours. Florida Senator Marco Rubio [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=18.76s)]
*  is expected to be named secretary of state, though Trump could still change his mind. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=24.92s)]
*  It's an enemies to allies storyline for the two men. They famously traded insults when [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  they were both running for president in 2016. Little Marco verse Hare Force One. But the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=35.08s)]
*  two made up and Rubio went on to become an informal foreign policy adviser for Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=41.28s)]
*  In terms of what he could bring to the State Department, Rubio has been one of the loudest [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=46.64s)]
*  voices in the Senate calling for a more aggressive stance towards China. And while he used to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=50.68s)]
*  take a hard line on Russia, he's been increasingly echoing Trump's criticism of funding for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=55.92s)]
*  Ukraine. I think the Ukrainians have been incredibly brave and strong and standing up [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=62.28s)]
*  to Russia. But at the end of the day, what we are funding here is a stalemate war and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=66.14s)]
*  needs to be brought to a conclusion because that country is another appointment. Representative [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=70.76s)]
*  of New York for United Nations ambassador. Stefanik has little diplomatic experience, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=76.24s)]
*  but was in the spotlight last year for her viral face offs with Ivy League presidents [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=81.96s)]
*  over anti-Semitism on college campuses, which led to several of them losing their jobs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=86.24s)]
*  She's also accused the United Nations of being plagued by, quote, anti-Semitic rot. And for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=92.0s)]
*  national security adviser, Trump's chosen representative Michael Waltz of Florida, a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=98.08s)]
*  former Green Beret, who's taken a hard line on China and Iran. We need a commander in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=103.32s)]
*  chief that is strong. But most of all, folks, and this is deadly serious, we need a commander [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=108.91999999999999s)]
*  in chief that our enemies respect and fear and fear. Trump's also made picks for two [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=115.8s)]
*  other key roles. He announced former representative Lee Zeldin of New York will lead the environmental [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  protection agency, a position that's expected to be key to Trump's plan to dismantle climate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=132.6s)]
*  regulations. And Trump is expected to name Stephen Miller, one of his most influential [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=138.16s)]
*  aides, to be deputy chief of staff. It's not clear yet what all he'd handle, but Miller [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=143.68s)]
*  has spent the last two years working on detailed plans for mass deportations. Trump's picks [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=149.0s)]
*  so far have been some of his most vocal supporters. He's repeatedly complained that his biggest [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=155.2s)]
*  error in his first term was not being more rigorous about his team and that he was sold [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=160.48s)]
*  on people back then who turned out to be, quote, disloyal. Meanwhile, on Wall Street, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=165.88s)]
*  we do get the closing bells here on this Monday afternoon, and there is a lot to cheer about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=178.0s)]
*  here. Modest stocks are continuing to rally in the wake of Trump's victory. The S&P 500 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=182.92s)]
*  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both set records yesterday, as investors anticipate [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=189.12s)]
*  business-friendly policies under a second Trump administration, including tax cuts and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=194.68s)]
*  lighter regulation. Bitcoin also hit a record high yesterday. The cryptocurrency has been [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=199.28s)]
*  booming over the past week with the news that there will be a crypto believer in the White [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=205.24s)]
*  House. Trump and his family have launched their own crypto venture, and while the Biden [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  administration aggressively pursued crypto companies for violating federal securities [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=214.04s)]
*  rules, investors hope Trump may take a softer approach. In Gaza, the Israeli military is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=218.84s)]
*  continuing its latest offensive in the north of the territory, where it's been carrying [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=229.84s)]
*  out near daily bombing for the last month. There's one gruesome image that we have heard [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  repeatedly from people in North Gaza, and that is that there are so many bodies now [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=239.96s)]
*  littering the streets at times that stray dogs are starting to pick at the corpses. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=245.4s)]
*  Times reporter Jack Nickus has been speaking with residents in the area. He says the attacks [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=252.56s)]
*  now are some of the most devastating of the entire war, causing the humanitarian crisis [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=257.24s)]
*  there to spiral even further. The aid to the region has been severely restricted, and at [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=262.48s)]
*  this point, many of the aid groups and emergency workers who were there a year ago have now [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=268.12s)]
*  left. One of the main hospitals, Kamal Adwan Hospital, is really teetering on edge. It [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=272.8s)]
*  is being inundated, of course, with victims of strikes, and yet it has essentially no [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  surgeons, a real dearth of medical supplies. And Islam Ahmad, a freelance journalist who [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=283.68s)]
*  spoke with us, told us, quote, life over the past four weeks, if I can sum it up, is the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  people being exterminated. Israel is back in North Gaza where it began the war, essentially, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=294.64s)]
*  because it says Hamas has come back. And this is really a reflection of Israel's kind of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=302.32s)]
*  murky strategy in this war. When it withdraws, the Hamas fighters return, and then the Israeli [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=309.32s)]
*  forces come back and chase them. And the result, I think, is a bloody carousel of sorts where [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=315.84s)]
*  the Israeli military is coming back again and again and again. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=322.96s)]
*  In Haiti, a Spirit Airlines flight attempting to land at the Port-au-Prince airport was [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=333.4s)]
*  shot at and had to divert, marking an escalation in the violence that's taken over the country. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=338.28s)]
*  A JetBlue flight leaving Haiti was also hit by a bullet yesterday. No passengers were [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=344.44s)]
*  hurt. Gangs have been terrorizing Haiti for over a year. Recently, hundreds of homes around [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=349.12s)]
*  the airport were bulldozed to try and build a safe perimeter for the runway with fewer places for [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=355.36s)]
*  the gangs to hide out. And Kenya has sent hundreds of police officers to try and help. But the gangs [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=360.56s)]
*  have been escalating their attacks and the country's in chaos. The interim prime minister [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=366.72s)]
*  was fired this week after less than six months on the job. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=371.76s)]
*  And finally, I've been talking to a lot of former senior leaders in the Navy's secretive and elite [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=379.12s)]
*  special boat teams about their high-powered boats, which have become so powerful that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=387.92s)]
*  riding in them over time could eventually cause brain injuries. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=394.64s)]
*  My colleague Dave Phillips has been reporting on the hidden toll that even routine military training, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=398.64s)]
*  nowhere near a combat zone, can have on soldiers. In his latest investigation, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=403.92s)]
*  he looked at what's happening to some crew members of the stealth boats that carry Navy SEALs. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=409.44s)]
*  These are essentially military versions of supercharged racing boats, and they skim over [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  the water at more than 60 miles an hour, which is great if the water's glassy smooth, but most of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  the time it's not. And so they're running over rough seas, going off one wave and crashing into [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=426.0s)]
*  the face of another. And what sailors describe to me is that this is like being in repeated car [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=431.84s)]
*  crashes, and there are high rates of injuries. Over time, these whiplash events pile up. And [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=437.44s)]
*  you can think of it a lot like playing contact sports for years. Even if you're never injured [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=444.96s)]
*  and carried off the field, there is damage that slowly accumulates. And what they said is over [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=449.52s)]
*  and over in their peers, when they reached senior levels of these special boat teams, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=455.76s)]
*  they started to fall apart with symptoms that are tied to brain injury, things like paranoia, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=461.36s)]
*  depression, confusion, forgetfulness. For some of these guys who got the most exposure to this wave [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=469.68s)]
*  pounding, their lives really turned into disasters. They became delusional and even psychotic. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=475.6s)]
*  Many of these guys developed serious substance abuse problems, and a number of them died by [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  suicide. I talked to the Defense Department about this and the Navy, and they were pretty [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=490.48s)]
*  tight-lipped about it. They said, hey, we know that this is a dangerous job and people can get [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  hurt doing it. But they would not say anything about whether routine driving of boats across [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=501.68s)]
*  the water could eventually cause brain injuries. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=521.44s)]
*  Why abortion rights won in the election even as Kamala Harris lost. That's next in the New York [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=526.0s)]
*  Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HVqV6cU1lg&t=532.64s)]
