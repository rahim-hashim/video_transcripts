# Israel Commemorates Oct. 7 Anniversary Amid Strikes on Gaza and Lebanon
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=5.12s)]
*  Today's Monday, October 7th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=6.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=8.6s)]
*  This morning, Israelis are holding memorials and rallies to commemorate the 1,200 people [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=13.68s)]
*  killed during the Hamas-led attack one year ago today. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=18.8s)]
*  Just three miles from Gaza, mourners gathered at the site of what was the Nova Music Festival, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=23.44s)]
*  where militants killed hundreds of festival-goers, and they played the last song that people [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=29.2s)]
*  heard that day before the attack began. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=34.08s)]
*  Then, in Jerusalem, a group of families with loved ones still being held hostage in Gaza [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=37.04s)]
*  gathered just down from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home, carrying pictures of their [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=42.9s)]
*  relatives. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=47.96s)]
*  More than 100 people are still believed to be held in Gaza, though many of them have [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=48.96s)]
*  died. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=53.8s)]
*  Families have accused Netanyahu of not doing enough to free the hostages. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=54.8s)]
*  When the war began, Netanyahu set out two goals—to bring the hostages home and to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=59.4s)]
*  defeat Hamas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  But, one year later, negotiations for a hostage deal and ceasefire have hit an impasse, and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=66.28s)]
*  Israel's own military now says defeating Hamas is not possible. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=73.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Gaza, a year of airstrikes have made the territory unrecognizable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=77.44s)]
*  More than 41,000 people have been killed by Israeli forces, according to Gaza health [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=83.88s)]
*  officials. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  Nearly the entire population has been uprooted and displaced. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  Israel stepped up its attacks in Gaza over the weekend, labeling most of the northern [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=94.32s)]
*  part of the territory an evacuation zone, and sending residents scrambling once again. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=98.92s)]
*  Israel also stepped up its attacks in Lebanon, and the whole region is still braced for Israel [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=105.72s)]
*  to fire back at Iran, underscoring how much the conflict has spread since the war began. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=111.14s)]
*  With less than a month to go until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris and former [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=126.34s)]
*  President Donald Trump are in an all-out campaign blitz. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=130.94s)]
*  Trump spent the weekend in the battleground states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=135.38s)]
*  A very big thank you to Pennsylvania. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=138.74s)]
*  We love Pennsylvania. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=143.26000000000002s)]
*  And as I was saying... [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=144.26000000000002s)]
*  On Saturday, he held a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, returning to the site of his attempted assassination [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=146.74s)]
*  this summer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=152.22s)]
*  The scene this time was very different. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=153.22s)]
*  Trump stood behind tall, bulletproof glass, and the security presence was noticeably more [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=156.34s)]
*  intense as he spoke to the crowd, many of whom were there when shots were fired in July. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=161.06s)]
*  But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=166.5s)]
*  Did not come close. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  Trump was joined on stage by his running mate, J.D. Vance, and by Elon Musk. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  Take over, Elon. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=181.17999999999998s)]
*  Yes, take over. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  Musk, who endorsed Trump right after the assassination attempt and has pledged millions to get him [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=184.18s)]
*  elected, urged rallygoers to vote, claiming without evidence the Democrats want to take [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=188.62s)]
*  away that right and delivering a dark warning. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=193.66s)]
*  Text people now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=197.34s)]
*  Now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=200.22s)]
*  And then make sure they actually do vote. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=202.66s)]
*  If they don't, this will be the last election. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=205.54s)]
*  That's my prediction. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=209.74s)]
*  For the Harris campaign, their focus this weekend was on interviews. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=211.78s)]
*  Tim Walz appeared on Fox News Sunday, while Harris, who's been criticized for not sitting [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=216.06s)]
*  down with reporters, took a different strategy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=221.17999999999998s)]
*  Madam Vice President, Alex, welcome to Call Her Daddy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  It is good to be with you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  Harris appeared on Call Her Daddy, a podcast about sex and dating that's popular with millennial [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=229.89999999999998s)]
*  and Gen Z women. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=234.66s)]
*  Their conversation focused on abortion rights and other women's issues. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=236.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, right now, this fight for what we need to do around reproductive freedom is, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=240.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean, could it be more at its core about just the basic right any individual of whatever [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=244.94s)]
*  gender has to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=252.46s)]
*  what to do? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=256.3s)]
*  Harris's campaign believes that traditional news media interviews have less to gain for [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=258.34000000000003s)]
*  her than appearing on podcasts and more niche outlets that might appeal to voters who aren't [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=262.86s)]
*  already tuned into the news. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=270.74s)]
*  Trump's political reporter Reid Epstein has been covering Harris's campaign. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=273.26s)]
*  He says that since entering the race, she's talked to Instagram influencers and even jumped [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=277.5s)]
*  on another podcast hosted by former NBA players, rather than talk with major news outlets. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=282.02s)]
*  She believes, and some of the polling bears out, that people who are already regular consumers [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  of television news or newspapers have already made up their minds on how to vote. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  The show will be on 60 minutes tonight, but Harris will also continue her more untraditional [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=300.28s)]
*  media tour this week with appearances on Howard Stern and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=305.76s)]
*  In North Carolina, people are still digging out from the damage of Hurricane Helene, and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=314.23999999999995s)]
*  some small mountain communities remain cut off, left without water, electricity, or cell [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  service. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=324.28s)]
*  But there's a new problem officials are warning about—misinformation. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=325.76s)]
*  Conspiracy theories and wild rumors about the recovery efforts have flooded social media, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  claims that towns are being bulldozed to cover up bodies or to clear the land to mine lithium. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  One local sheriff who spent days pushing back against the rumors told the Times he's never [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=343.2s)]
*  seen anything like it, and officials are worried that it could undermine efforts to share accurate [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  information about crucial resources. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=353.32s)]
*  Much of the misinformation has been directed at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=356.88s)]
*  with people claiming it's stealing donations or refusing help from others. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=361.46s)]
*  Trump has added to that chorus, falsely claiming funds are being diverted to house undocumented [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=366.36s)]
*  migrants and that areas where Republican voters live are being intentionally neglected. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=371.84s)]
*  You know, it's frankly ridiculous and just plain false. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=377.32s)]
*  This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=382.08s)]
*  FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell pushed back against Trump's comments in an interview [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=385.8s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=390.08s)]
*  I need to make sure I can get the resources to where they're needed. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=391.08s)]
*  And when you have this dangerous rhetoric like you're hearing, it creates fear in our [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=394.52s)]
*  own employees. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  We need to make sure we're getting help to the people who need it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=400.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, storm preparations are now underway in parts of Florida, in advance of another [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=404.0s)]
*  that's forecasted to hit the U.S. Hurricane Milton is projected to slam into Florida's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=409.88s)]
*  West Coast on Wednesday. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=415.64s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis said a flurry of evacuation orders will be issued over the next day. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  And finally, the genetic testing company 23andMe used to be on top of the world. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=427.64s)]
*  Customer after customer bought their DNA testing kits, sending in a saliva sample for the chance [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=433.64s)]
*  to trace their ancestry and family tree. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=439.18s)]
*  The company hit a peak value of $6 billion. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=442.26s)]
*  Now its future is uncertain. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=446.66s)]
*  Its share prices have dropped. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=449.08s)]
*  The board's directors resigned en masse last month, and it's still under the shadow of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=450.7s)]
*  a massive data breach from last year. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=455.36s)]
*  All of the turmoil has sparked questions about the company's future and what will happen [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=458.7s)]
*  to its roughly 15 million customers' genetic information. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=463.38s)]
*  This info contains details about people's potential for health risks, like heart disease [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=468.38s)]
*  or psychosis, which some fear could be exposed. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=473.1s)]
*  A company spokesman told the Times, 23andMe adheres to all laws about data privacy and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=477.18s)]
*  that nothing about that commitment has changed. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=482.54s)]
*  But one professor of biomedical informatics told the Times, quote, in theory, if there's [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=485.54s)]
*  a mess up with your credit card or social security number, you get a new one. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=490.21999999999997s)]
*  It can be fixed. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=493.94s)]
*  But there's absolutely no way to get a new genome. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=495.34s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=502.38s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Sabrina Tabernisi returns to the story of two men, one in Israel and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=503.61999999999995s)]
*  one in Gaza, to hear how their lives have changed in the last year. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=509.14s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklul-FbGQM&t=514.18s)]
