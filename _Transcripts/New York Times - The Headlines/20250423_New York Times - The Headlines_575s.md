# A State Department Shake-Up, and Musk Pivots as Tesla Profits Plunge
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=4.96s)]
*  Today's Wednesday, April 23rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=8.44s)]
*  To deliver on President Trump's America first foreign policy, we must make the State Department [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  great again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=20.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has rolled out a plan to make major cuts to the State Department, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=21.16s)]
*  potentially drastically reducing America's diplomatic engagement around the world. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=26.0s)]
*  This sprawling bureaucracy created a system more beholden to radical political ideology [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=30.8s)]
*  than advancing America's core national interests. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=37.54s)]
*  A State Department spokeswoman said the agency needs to be trimmed back to be more nimble, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=40.96s)]
*  and Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued the overhaul will root out what he framed [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=46.0s)]
*  as left-wing activists. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  After the new plan, about 700 positions will be eliminated, and many of the State Department's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=53.04s)]
*  offices and bureaus will be closed, including a prominent one focused on promoting democracy [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  and human rights. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=62.84s)]
*  And more changes could be coming soon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  Rubio has instructed senior officials to prepare to cut hundreds more staff, and the administration [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=66.72s)]
*  is considering closing more than two dozen embassies and consulates. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=72.44s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers have warned that if the U.S. retreats from the global stage, other [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=77.36s)]
*  major powers will fill that diplomatic void. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=81.88s)]
*  For example, if the State Department goes through with the proposed consulate closures, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  the U.S. would have less diplomatic presence in Europe than China does. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=89.8s)]
*  We have thousands of people that are ready to go out, and you can't have a trial for [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=102.32s)]
*  all of these people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=108.88s)]
*  In the Oval Office yesterday, President Trump said undocumented immigrants should not be [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=110.38s)]
*  entitled to a trial before they're deported. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=114.92s)]
*  A judge can't say, no, you have to have a trial. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=117.58s)]
*  The trial's going to take two years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=121.38s)]
*  The president claims he needs to bypass the right-to-do process to quickly expel migrants, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=125.1s)]
*  falsely stating that many of them are criminals intentionally sent to the U.S. by other countries. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  It's the second time this week he's insisted he should be able to go around the Constitution [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=136.38s)]
*  to carry out mass deportations. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=141.1s)]
*  He previously wrote on social media, we cannot give everyone a trial, suggesting it would [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=143.7s)]
*  take too long. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=148.78s)]
*  In response, one Democratic congressman called Trump's comments dictator talk, adding that, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  quote, due process isn't optional because it's inconvenient. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=156.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Times has been looking into the cases of the more than 200 migrants the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=162.3s)]
*  Trump administration already did send out of the country without a trial. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=166.86s)]
*  The government claimed it was justified in doing so because it said the migrants were [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=171.3s)]
*  violent gang members. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=175.02s)]
*  But my colleague Julie Turkowitz says there's little evidence of that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  A team of us reporters and researchers dedicated weeks to understanding the criminal backgrounds [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=180.74s)]
*  of these individuals. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=189.8s)]
*  And of the 238 men sent to El Salvador, we were only able to find serious criminal accusations [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=192.12s)]
*  or convictions for 32 of them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=200.28s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Julie explains who was actually deported and the secretive process [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  used to send them out of the country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  We're entering a new era as the global economic system that has operated for the last 80 years [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  is being reset. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=219.76s)]
*  The International Monetary Fund has issued a stark new projection of what President Trump's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  trade war will mean for the global economy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  It says that worldwide economic growth is now expected to slow, in large part because [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  of Trump's aggressive tariffs and the economic backlash they've set off. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=236.0s)]
*  Before Trump took office, growth was expected to hold steady. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=240.88s)]
*  The IMF also projected that the economic turmoil will cause inflation to rise in the US this [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=244.92s)]
*  year. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=250.44s)]
*  And it said the chance of a recession in the US has jumped. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=251.44s)]
*  It was about 25% last fall. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=255.27999999999997s)]
*  Now it's 40%. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=257.68s)]
*  Hello, everyone. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=266.32s)]
*  Well, it's never a dull moment these days. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=267.32s)]
*  Elon Musk got on a call with Tesla investors last night to try and calm the waters after [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=269.48s)]
*  the electric carmaker announced its profits have plunged. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=274.84s)]
*  As some people know, there's been some blowback for the time that I've been spending in government [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=279.0s)]
*  with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=283.0s)]
*  The company's profits dropped 71% in the first three months of this year compared to last [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  year. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=290.96s)]
*  The brand's popularity has taken a major hit as Musk, Tesla's CEO, has become one of the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=291.96s)]
*  most prominent figures in the Trump administration. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=297.76s)]
*  But starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=300.36s)]
*  On the call, Musk said he'll soon cut back to just one or two days a week in Washington, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=306.72s)]
*  ceding to investors' demands that he refocus on the company. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=312.6s)]
*  But my colleague Jack Ewing, who covers the automotive industry, says Tesla's also facing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=316.68s)]
*  broader issues in the EV market. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=321.88s)]
*  The company is really in a crisis. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  It's losing market share. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=326.88s)]
*  It's facing much stiffer competition from established carmakers in China, as well as [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=328.3s)]
*  in the United States and Europe. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=333.52s)]
*  Jack says Tesla's latest vehicle, the Cybertruck, is increasingly looking like a flop by the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=336.04s)]
*  sales numbers. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=341.44s)]
*  And the company hasn't rolled out any other new models yet to attract customers. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=342.8s)]
*  Just Elon coming back to the company is not going to instantly solve all of its problems. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=347.2s)]
*  Some of them are pretty deep. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=351.04s)]
*  There's been a lot of permanent damage to the brand. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  And he also acknowledged that tariffs are a problem for Tesla. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=355.18s)]
*  It's one of the most American-made vehicles. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=358.70000000000005s)]
*  It gets most of its parts from within the United States, but Tesla is still going to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=361.06s)]
*  be hurt by tariffs. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=365.14000000000004s)]
*  And Mr. Musk said he's tried to talk the president out of tariffs, but really hasn't succeeded. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=366.86s)]
*  So there's no miracle cure for Tesla at the moment. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=372.92s)]
*  New data released from the CDC this morning shows that the birthrate in the U.S. remains [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=376.14s)]
*  near a record low. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=388.3s)]
*  3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, barely up from the rock bottom level [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=390.21999999999997s)]
*  set in 2023. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=395.65999999999997s)]
*  Breaking that out, the fertility rate per woman is about 1.6 births. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=397.78s)]
*  That's well below the 2.1 needed to maintain the country's population through births alone. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=402.78s)]
*  Part of the decrease in recent decades is about who is having children. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=408.82s)]
*  Up through the early 2000s, teen pregnancies were helping boost the national birthrate, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=413.46s)]
*  but growing access to birth control has driven those numbers down. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=418.61999999999995s)]
*  The birthrate for women in their 20s has also fallen off, especially since the Great Recession [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=422.41999999999996s)]
*  starting around 2007. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=427.7s)]
*  One demographer told the Times that economic conditions, like student debt and child care [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=429.98s)]
*  costs, as well as a sense of instability in the world, likely play a role, saying, quote, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=435.26s)]
*  people don't have kids when they don't feel good about their own futures. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=441.22s)]
*  The low birthrate is widely seen as a growing problem for the country, which could find [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=445.58000000000004s)]
*  itself in the coming decades with fewer young workers to support an aging population. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  And finally. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=460.98s)]
*  All right, so here we are in front of the elephants. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=461.98s)]
*  Exactly 20 years ago today, this video titled Me at the Zoo became the first ever video [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=465.98s)]
*  posted to YouTube. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=472.26s)]
*  The whole thing is 19 seconds and it's not particularly compelling, but it kicked off [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=476.18s)]
*  what's now become a cornerstone of the internet that's fundamentally changed what and how [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=481.14000000000004s)]
*  we watch. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=486.1s)]
*  Is this real life? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=487.1s)]
*  Yeah, this is real life. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=488.9s)]
*  Within a year of launching, YouTube had become the place to watch viral videos. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=490.94s)]
*  And when Google swooped in to buy it, that supercharged the platform. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=496.21999999999997s)]
*  Ow, Charlie! [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=500.14s)]
*  That really hurt! [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=502.14s)]
*  Over the years, it's made stars out of ordinary people, sometimes in their cringiest of moments. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=504.02s)]
*  It's Friday, Friday. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=510.14s)]
*  And it's elevated whole art forms. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=512.38s)]
*  Hello, guys. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=514.46s)]
*  Hello, hello, hello. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=515.46s)]
*  Like the ASMR video. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=517.02s)]
*  Today we're going to be unboxing the black and white iPhone 3G units. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=518.14s)]
*  Or the hours of people unwrapping stuff. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nurJCClI7zk&t=522.62s)]
