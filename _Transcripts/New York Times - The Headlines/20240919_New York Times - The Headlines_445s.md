# Polls Find Harris-Trump Deadlock, and Device Attacks Spread Fear in Lebanon
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amelia Nierenberg. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Thursday, September 19th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=6.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=8.56s)]
*  Polling from the Times and its partners is giving a new snapshot of the election in the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=15.0s)]
*  days after the presidential debate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=18.56s)]
*  Kamala Harris overwhelmingly impressed likely voters. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=20.88s)]
*  Almost 70% of them said she did well at last week's debate compared to just 40% who said [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=24.48s)]
*  the same for Donald Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=29.48s)]
*  The polls from the Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer, and Siena College showed that Harris [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  even got a positive review from the majority of one of Trump's most loyal demographics, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=36.36s)]
*  white voters without a college degree. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  But when it comes to who Americans say they'll vote for, the debate didn't seem to move [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=43.9s)]
*  the needle. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=47.72s)]
*  Despite surging enthusiasm among Democrats, Harris does not have a decisive edge. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=49.08s)]
*  The race is still a toss-up, 47% to 47%. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=54.32s)]
*  And the polling indicates Harris might have missed an opportunity to address voters' [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=59.28s)]
*  concerns that they don't know enough about her. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  The share of voters who said they still want to learn more about Harris is nearly the same [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=65.2s)]
*  now as it was before the debate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=69.0s)]
*  No endorsement, I think, sends a message to both parties that if they truly want to support [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=76.92s)]
*  working people, they have to reevaluate it and understand that nothing is given, it is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=82.12s)]
*  earned. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=87.08s)]
*  The Teamsters Union, which represents more than 1.3 million truck drivers, freight haulers, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=88.2s)]
*  and other workers, has announced that it will not back a presidential candidate this year. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=92.32s)]
*  The president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Sean O'Brien, said that, quote, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=97.6s)]
*  neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=102.48s)]
*  of working people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=107.28s)]
*  The decision means that neither Harris nor Trump will have the union's organizing muscle [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=108.96s)]
*  on their side in the final few weeks of the campaign. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  But it's seen as a particular blow to Harris. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=116.2s)]
*  In recent elections, the Teamsters backed Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  and Harris has supported pro-organizing legislation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=124.28s)]
*  Notably, she had locked in the support of all the other biggest unions in the country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=127.0s)]
*  Trump, however, has been wooing O'Brien. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=131.4s)]
*  He invited him to his club, Mar-a-Lago, this summer, and O'Brien got a primetime slot [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=134.52s)]
*  at the Republican National Convention. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  While none of the board members of the Teamsters voted to back Trump, two union surveys showed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=142.24s)]
*  that he had much more support among rank and file members than Harris. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=146.52s)]
*  Lebanon was thrown into chaos again yesterday when more handheld devices began exploding. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=157.52s)]
*  At least 20 people were killed and hundreds more were injured when walkie-talkies carried [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=165.16000000000003s)]
*  by members of Hezbollah blew up. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  It was the second coordinated attack against the militant group this week. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=172.88s)]
*  On Tuesday, exploding pagers killed at least 12 people and maimed thousands more, including [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=177.0s)]
*  many civilians. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=182.28s)]
*  Defense and intelligence officials who were briefed on the attacks tell the Times that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  they were a carefully coordinated Israeli operation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=187.84s)]
*  They say that Israel didn't tamper with the devices, it made them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=191.56s)]
*  They say that Israel used a shell company based in Hungary to sell normal pagers to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  normal clients. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=199.84s)]
*  But in 2022, it also started sending pagers filled with explosives to Lebanon. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  Israeli intelligence officers referred to the booby-trap devices as buttons that could [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=206.76s)]
*  be pushed when the time seemed ripe. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=211.0s)]
*  Effectively, a Trojan horse built to detonate on command. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=213.12s)]
*  Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the explosions, but the country has [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=217.76s)]
*  a history of covert attacks on Iran and its affiliates, like Hezbollah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=221.54s)]
*  In one case, it assassinated a top Iranian nuclear scientist remotely using an AI-assisted [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=226.1s)]
*  robot. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Times Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley takes a closer look [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=232.73999999999998s)]
*  at the attacks. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  He explains what they could mean for Israel's ongoing fight with Hezbollah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=248.82s)]
*  My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=250.88s)]
*  employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=256.04s)]
*  On Wednesday, Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, announced that the Fed [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=259.68s)]
*  is lowering interest rates for the first time in four years. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=264.04s)]
*  They're dropping rates half a percentage point, an unusually large move. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=267.86s)]
*  Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=272.04s)]
*  inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=276.38s)]
*  The Fed has been trying to strike a balance. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=280.34s)]
*  It's kept rates up to fight inflation, but it's also trying not to hold them so high [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=283.06s)]
*  for so long that the job market suffers. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=287.78s)]
*  It's important to keep in mind that this represents a win, but also a worry. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=290.96s)]
*  Ben Castleman covers economics for The Times. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=297.17999999999995s)]
*  The win here is that inflation has come down a lot and the Fed feels like it's in a place [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=300.0s)]
*  where it can cut interest rates. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=305.34s)]
*  But the fear here is the unemployment rate has been rising and has been rising in part [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=308.34s)]
*  because of those high interest rates, which has made it harder for people to spend. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=313.58s)]
*  It's made it harder for companies to invest in their businesses. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  And the Fed is concerned that if they don't cut rates further, that that could lead to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  a further slowdown in the economy, to more job losses, to more unemployment, and ultimately [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  to a recession. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=334.65999999999997s)]
*  Ben says that the Fed is signaling that it will cut rates even more in the coming months, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=336.26000000000005s)]
*  though it's not yet clear by how much. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=340.74s)]
*  And finally, MrBeast is known for being kind of like the internet's fairy godmother. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=347.44000000000005s)]
*  Whichever one lasts the longest in this queue, would have a million dollars for their subscribers. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=352.3s)]
*  The YouTube star gives out big prizes to people who participate in his elaborate stunts. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=357.82000000000005s)]
*  And it works. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=362.6s)]
*  His channel is one of the most popular on the platform with 316 million subscribers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=363.6s)]
*  I give you all three days. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=369.04s)]
*  Stephanie's arms! [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  Earlier this year, MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, announced his biggest [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  competition yet. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=376.8s)]
*  Beast Games, a reality show with a five million dollar prize. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=378.56s)]
*  About 2,000 fans were chosen to participate and they moved into a stadium in Nevada where [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=383.0s)]
*  they lived, slept, and faced off in challenges like extreme capture the flag. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=387.72s)]
*  The show was always going to be a little chaotic. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=393.62s)]
*  But a number of contestants say the set was dangerous too. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  Now some of them are suing. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=400.64000000000004s)]
*  They've claimed there wasn't enough food or medical care on set. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  Multiple people were hurt, several were hospitalized. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  Their suit also claims some contestants weren't appropriately paid. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=410.16s)]
*  Amazon MGM Studios, which is producing the show, didn't respond to a request for comment [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=414.24s)]
*  from the Times. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=418.72s)]
*  Representatives for MrBeast declined to comment. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=420.36s)]
*  One contestant quoted in the lawsuit said, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=423.2s)]
*  If you know his videos, you know they always seem really great and exciting and grand. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=425.6s)]
*  However, things are not always what they seem. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=430.36s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=435.52s)]
*  I'm Amelia Nierenberg. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=436.52s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WMW9omfvZE&t=438.28000000000003s)]
