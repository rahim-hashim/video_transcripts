# Israel Attacks Iran, India Plane Crash Survivor Speaks, and a Friday News Quiz | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=5.28s)]
*  Today's Friday, June 13th. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=7.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=8.68s)]
*  Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=13.56s)]
*  back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=20.16s)]
*  Israel launched a stunning series of strikes against Iran last night, with 200 Israeli [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=24.96s)]
*  warplanes dropping hundreds of bombs across the country and striking over 100 targets. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=29.96s)]
*  Residents of Iran's capital, Tehran, weathered a night of terror and shock, reeling from [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=35.36s)]
*  explosions across the city as the entire Middle East moves closer toward a full-blown regional [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=39.68s)]
*  war. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  Among Israel's targets were some of Iran's key nuclear sites, including its main enrichment [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=46.28s)]
*  as well as a research center. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  At least two prominent nuclear scientists have been killed. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  Israel also struck a huge blow to Iran's military chain of command. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  Iran has confirmed that its three highest-ranking generals have been killed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  For years, Iran has openly called for Israel's destruction, and Israel has argued that Iran's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=64.56s)]
*  acquisition of nuclear weapons would be an existential threat. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=69.36s)]
*  Israel is describing this attack as preemptive, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=73.72s)]
*  Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=78.44s)]
*  I want to assure the civilized world, we will not let the world's most dangerous regime [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  get the world's most dangerous weapons. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=87.72s)]
*  Netanyahu is hailing the attack as a success, but warned to the Israeli public that they [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=90.36s)]
*  should prepare for the fighting to go on for days. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=94.92s)]
*  A senior official from the Israel Defense Forces told Israeli television, quote, we [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=97.8s)]
*  are at war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=102.24s)]
*  Iran's leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, said on Iranian state television that Israel should, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=104.12s)]
*  quote, anticipate a harsh punishment. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  Iran later fired about 100 drones at Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=111.08s)]
*  I think it's very hard to know what the next couple of days are going to bring. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=113.84s)]
*  Aaron Boxerman is in Israel covering the attack. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=117.28s)]
*  In Israel, people are anxiously awaiting Iranian retaliation, which would likely take the form [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  of volleys of hundreds of ballistic missiles and drones and other munitions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  In Iran, people are similarly, fearfully waiting what might come next, how far this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=130.88s)]
*  fighting will go. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=136.96s)]
*  And the truth is that we don't really have a template for this because we've never really [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=139.76s)]
*  been here before. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=142.48s)]
*  Israel and Iran have fought a decades-long shadow war, which is characterized by covert [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=144.24s)]
*  assassinations and subterfuge and sabotage. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=149.2s)]
*  But we're in a totally different place right now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=154.16s)]
*  Iranian officials have said that the U.S. was not involved in the strikes, but President [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=160.16s)]
*  Trump told Fox News he did know about Israel's plans to target top Iranian leaders. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=164.2s)]
*  Trump has been trying to negotiate with Iran to get the country to freeze its nuclear program. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=169.72s)]
*  Israel's strikes have torpedoed those plans, with Iran saying it won't participate in talks [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=174.48s)]
*  with the U.S. until further notice. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=178.74s)]
*  Trump posted this morning on social media pushing Iran to make a deal with the U.S., [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=181.46s)]
*  There is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=186.92s)]
*  even more brutal, come to an end. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=190.88s)]
*  He added, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  In California, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  Today was really about a test of democracy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  And today we passed the test. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=210.73999999999998s)]
*  We the people passed the test. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=212.64s)]
*  A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from mobilizing National [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Guard troops in Los Angeles. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=220.12s)]
*  In a ruling Thursday night, the judge cut off the president's control of the troops, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=222.24s)]
*  calling their deployment a quote, dangerous precedent that was illegal and unconstitutional. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=226.64s)]
*  Trump relied on a rarely used law to mobilize 4,000 National Guard troops. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=232.08s)]
*  That law requires the president to go through the governor to do so. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=236.64s)]
*  But the administration ignored that and went around Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=240.2s)]
*  It was the latest judicial rebuke over Trump's use of emergency powers, and the ruling returned [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=244.12s)]
*  authority of California National Guard troops back to Newsom. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=249.04s)]
*  The National Guard will be redeployed to what they were doing before Donald Trump commandeered [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=252.56s)]
*  them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=257.8s)]
*  The National Guard will go back to border security, working on counter drug enforcement [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=258.8s)]
*  and fentanyl enforcement. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=264.64s)]
*  The order was supposed to take effect today, but the administration quickly filed an appeal, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=266.12s)]
*  and late last night, an appeals court blocked the order from going into effect until it [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=271.28s)]
*  can review the case. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=275.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=281.76s)]
*  Sir, sir, hands up, hands up. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=282.76s)]
*  I'm Senator Alex Padilla. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=285.84s)]
*  I have a question for the secretary. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=287.76s)]
*  In a news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday, California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=290.79999999999995s)]
*  removed, shoved to the ground, and handcuffed by federal agents as he interrupted a briefing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=295.84s)]
*  by Secretary of Homeland Security Christine Noem. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=300.72s)]
*  Hands on your back. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=303.08s)]
*  If you let me, if you let me, hands go ahead, put them behind my back. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=304.08s)]
*  Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, cool. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=307.08s)]
*  Hey, put one hand, lay flat, lay flat. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=308.08s)]
*  Padilla had attended the press conference because he said he could not get answers from [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=310.12s)]
*  the administration on its immigration crackdown. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=313.44s)]
*  And at one point, he interrupted Noem, calling out a question about mugshots that were on [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  display. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=320.32s)]
*  That's when agents grabbed him, pushed him out of the room, and forced him to his knees. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=321.32s)]
*  Padilla appeared stunned and repeated that he was a U.S. senator. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  He was uncuffed only after an adviser to Noem intervened. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=329.12s)]
*  This is how the Department of Homeland Security and the people around the secretary will treat [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=332.6s)]
*  a United States senator for having the audacity to ask a question. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=337.88s)]
*  That imagine what they are doing to people in communities, not just throughout Los Angeles, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=342.36s)]
*  but throughout the country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=347.92s)]
*  Padilla and other Democrats expressed outrage after the incident. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=349.92s)]
*  Gavin Newsom called the scene outrageous. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security defended the agents, saying they [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  believed Padilla was an attacker and accused the senator of engaging in quote, disrespectful [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=359.6s)]
*  political theater. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  Top FBI officials also defended the federal agents. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=366.16s)]
*  But even some Republicans denounced Padilla's treatment. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=369.44000000000005s)]
*  Senator Susan Collins of Maine said the incident was very disturbing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  And Lisa Murkowski, a senator from Alaska, said quote, it's not the America I know. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=376.16s)]
*  More details are emerging from a plane crash in Western India that killed more than 260 [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=385.72s)]
*  people on Thursday. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=393.32000000000005s)]
*  The Air India flight, which was headed to London, crashed just seconds after takeoff. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=394.68s)]
*  Video verified by the Times shows the plane descending slowly. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  It then appears to have skidded along the ground, damaging buildings and then crashing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  into a local medical college. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=408.0s)]
*  At least five students at the college were killed. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=410.32000000000005s)]
*  But officials say as many as three dozen people caught in the path of the plane may have died. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=412.96s)]
*  Of the more than 240 passengers on the plane, just one is known to have survived. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  The Times spoke with his family, who lived in the UK, hours after the crash. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=423.08s)]
*  This morning, local health services appeared overwhelmed as they carried out hundreds of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=443.96s)]
*  DNA tests to identify bodies so they can return them to families. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=449.2s)]
*  And finally, there are some relationships that are just meant to be, even if one party [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  isn't entirely thrilled about it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  And research now shows that nothing quite compares to the connection between humans [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=468.4s)]
*  and bedbugs. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=472.6s)]
*  According to a new study published in the journal Biology Letters, the bedbugs' long [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  affair with humans has been going on for much longer than previously thought, about 245,000 [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=478.08000000000004s)]

*  Back then, the insect fed entirely off of cave-dwelling bats, until it discovered the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=485.56s)]
*  blood of a Neanderthal or some other early human that set up shop in the same cave. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  From that point on, scientists say, bedbugs diverged into two distinct species, one that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=496.04s)]
*  lived solely on bat blood and one that became exclusively reliant on humans. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=501.04s)]
*  But the study says, the key to the bedbugs' longevity is their resilience. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=506.28000000000003s)]
*  They can live for more than a year without feeding, and they have a remarkable ability [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  to overcome pesticides through rapid genetic mutation. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=514.08s)]
*  Today, their populations are surging, thanks to globalization, the rise of inexpensive [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=517.6s)]
*  air travel, and accelerating urbanization. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=522.72s)]

*  Now for the quiz. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=558.5999999999999s)]
*  We've got questions about three stories The Times has covered this week. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=560.56s)]
*  Can you answer them all? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=564.3399999999999s)]
*  First up. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=569.0s)]
*  For a little breaking news, we are also going to be restoring the names to Fort Pickett, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=570.0s)]
*  Fort Hood, Fort Gordon, Fort Rucker. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=578.1199999999999s)]
*  During a speech this week, President Trump said he will restore the names of U.S. Army [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=582.16s)]
*  Lee or Fort Hood that were once named for Confederate generals. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=586.96s)]
*  Fort Bragg is in, that's the name, and Fort Bragg, it shall always remain. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=591.08s)]
*  That's never going to be happening again. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=598.36s)]
*  He was speaking to soldiers at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, originally named for the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=600.76s)]
*  Confederate general Braxton Bragg. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=605.0s)]
*  That name temporarily changed in 2023. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=607.76s)]
*  What name had it changed to? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=611.1600000000001s)]
*  Is it Fort Freedom, Fort Liberty, or Fort Eisenhower? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=614.32s)]
*  The answer? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  Fort Liberty. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=627.88s)]
*  The change came after Congress passed a law mandating that Confederate names be removed [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=629.4200000000001s)]
*  from bases. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=633.4000000000001s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth restored the name back to Bragg in February, and now they're [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=634.9200000000001s)]
*  doing that for seven more Army installations. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=639.08s)]
*  In a statement, the Army said that the restored base names will no longer honor Confederates, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=642.12s)]
*  but instead honor other American soldiers with similar names or initials, like Fort [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=646.8s)]
*  Lee, which is officially being named in honor of Private Fitz Lee, a Black soldier who fought [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=651.32s)]
*  in the Spanish-American War. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=656.64s)]
*  Okay, next question. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=659.44s)]
*  Organizers in Spain, Italy, and Portugal are planning to protest against overtourism in [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=663.28s)]
*  visitor hotspots on Sunday. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=667.84s)]
*  They're expected to hold marches, disrupt traffic, picket airports, and block entrances [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  to tourist attractions. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=674.36s)]
*  They say the surge in tourism has contributed to housing shortages and rising rents for [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=676.0600000000001s)]
*  locals. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=680.28s)]
*  This isn't the first time tourists have been targeted. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=681.48s)]
*  Last summer, during a march in Barcelona, protesters harassed visitors using what? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=688.64s)]
*  This news report from last year has the answer bleeped out. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  See if you can get it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=697.2s)]
*  They marched around major tourist hotspots in that city, spraying visitors with brightly [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=698.2s)]
*  colored lights, encouraging them to go home. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=703.88s)]
*  What were the protesters carrying? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=708.6400000000001s)]
*  The answer is water guns. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  They squirted tourists sitting outside restaurants. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=720.5400000000001s)]
*  Organizers say it was such a hit last year that they're encouraging protesters to bring [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=723.84s)]
*  back their colorful water guns this weekend. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=727.34s)]
*  Okay, last question. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=731.26s)]
*  We told you earlier this week that the world is on the cusp of a BTS reunion. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=738.1800000000001s)]
*  The popular boy band has been on hiatus since 2022, releasing solo albums and serving their [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=742.72s)]
*  mandatory military service in South Korea. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=747.7800000000001s)]
*  The last member wraps up his service next week, and the band expects to go into the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=751.02s)]
*  to work on a new album. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=755.82s)]
*  So to honor the return of one of K-pop's biggest acts, we want to test how well you know BTS [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=757.74s)]
*  songs. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=763.9000000000001s)]
*  We'll play you three clips. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=764.9000000000001s)]
*  Two of them will be from BTS. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=765.9000000000001s)]
*  One of them will be from another K-pop group. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=768.58s)]
*  You have to figure out which one isn't a BTS song. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=771.44s)]
*  Okay, here's song number one. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=775.34s)]
*  Here's number two. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=780.42s)]
*  And here's the last song. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=797.78s)]
*  Okay, which one is not from BTS? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=803.42s)]
*  If you said song number one was not BTS, you're right. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=816.02s)]
*  That was the group Stray Kids with their hit God's Menu. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=820.36s)]
*  The BTS songs were Butter and Fake Love. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=824.0999999999999s)]
*  Full disclosure, I would absolutely have not gotten that. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=828.06s)]
*  All right, that's it for the news quiz. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=830.78s)]
*  If you want to tell us how you did or what you think about the quiz, you can always [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYmqO3-d5Do&t=833.34s)]
