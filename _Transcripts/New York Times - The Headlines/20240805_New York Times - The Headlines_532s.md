# Democrats Divided Over V.P. Field, and Israel Braces for Retaliation
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=4.8s)]
*  Today is Monday, August 5th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=5.8s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris's very accelerated search for a running mate is now in its final countdown. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=14.48s)]
*  Three leading contenders for the spot were all in D.C. yesterday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Minnesota Governor Tim [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=24.6s)]
*  Walls, each met with Harris at her home for what's being described as a chemistry test. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=29.88s)]
*  Harris's aides say having a good rapport with her team is a priority for her. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=36.32s)]
*  She's expected to announce her pick tomorrow, but the Times has learned that rifts have [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=40.92s)]
*  emerged inside the Democratic Party over her choices. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=45.2s)]
*  Progressive groups have criticized Shapiro and Kelly as being too conservative on key [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=49.68s)]
*  issues. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  And while Shapiro has emerged as a favorite of the party's pro-Israel donors, some progressive [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=56.0s)]
*  activists have objected to his stance on Israel's military campaign in Gaza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=61.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, a group of progressive donors have been making the push for Walls, even though [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=66.64s)]
*  Minnesota is unlikely to play a critical role in Harris's path to the White House. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=72.1s)]
*  A compromise candidate could be Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who has fans among both liberal [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=77.68s)]
*  and centrist Democratic donors. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=83.36s)]
*  He's not known to have been in D.C. yesterday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=85.8s)]
*  The contenders will be told either tonight or tomorrow morning whether or not they'll [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=88.8s)]
*  be on the ticket. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=92.92s)]
*  And Harris's VP pick is expected to be on stage at a rally with Harris tomorrow night [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=94.52s)]
*  in Philadelphia. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=99.94s)]
*  This morning, stock markets tumbled across Asia as news about the U.S. economy has rattled [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=106.88s)]
*  investors. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=112.4s)]
*  The declines were most dramatic in Japan, where one major index dropped 12 percent, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=113.96s)]
*  its biggest one-day loss in more than three decades. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  Globally, investors are panicking over signs that the American economy, the largest in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=122.88s)]
*  the world, could be cooling. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=127.88s)]
*  On Friday, the U.S. jobs report showed that hiring slowed significantly in July, and the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=130.22s)]
*  U.S. unemployment rate hit a three-year high. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=135.48s)]
*  The stock declines are expected to continue in Europe and the U.S. as markets opened there [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=138.4s)]
*  this morning. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  We are looking at potentially really, really significant flooding that will happen, particularly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=149.44s)]
*  in north central Florida, as this storm makes landfall in Florida and then heads northeast. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=155.22s)]
*  Hurricane Debbie is expected to make landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast this morning after [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=161.0s)]
*  rapidly gaining strength and becoming a Category 1 storm. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=165.84s)]
*  Hurricane Debbie will hit along a stretch of coast that was devastated just a year ago [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=170.88s)]
*  by Hurricane Edalia. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=174.68s)]
*  Its wind speeds are lower, but Hurricane Debbie is expected to bring much more rain to the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=176.9s)]
*  region as it moves slowly across Florida and then north into Georgia and South Carolina [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=181.36s)]
*  in the coming days. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=186.6s)]
*  Up to 30 inches of rain could fall in some places, and the National Hurricane Center [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=188.68s)]
*  warned that rainfall totals could be, quote, historic. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=193.48s)]
*  In the Middle East, the wait for major retaliatory strikes is stretching into a new week. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=201.48s)]
*  Iran and its proxy forces have been planning an attack on Israel after the recent killings [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=209.28s)]
*  of a top Hezbollah commander and the political leader of Hamas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=213.76s)]
*  Over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was prepared for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=218.56s)]
*  any scenario, both offensively and defensively. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=223.88s)]
*  The threat of an escalating regional war has set off alarm bells. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=228.36s)]
*  The U.S. urged its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  France told its citizens to leave Iran as soon as possible. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  And multiple international airlines have suspended flights to and from Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel has continued its attacks in Gaza. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=246.4s)]
*  In the last few days, dozens of people have been killed as Israel carried out strikes [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=250.88000000000002s)]
*  on three schools that were functioning as shelters. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=255.36s)]
*  The deadliest came yesterday in Gaza City. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  According to Palestinian authorities, an Israeli F-16 fighter jet targeted a school killing [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=262.2s)]
*  30 people, most of them women and children. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=267.44s)]
*  One survivor of the attack said he had just sat down for a meal with his family when the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=271.04s)]
*  school was hit, saying it, quote, felt like we were burning as if a volcano had erupted [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=275.16s)]
*  over us. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=280.76s)]
*  The Israeli military said there was a Hamas command center at the school and that it took [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=282.44s)]
*  steps to mitigate civilian casualties. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  It's unclear if any of the people killed were militants. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=289.92s)]
*  Today in Bangladesh, thousands of protesters have streamed into the capital city of Dhaka [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=301.28s)]
*  to march on the prime minister's home and demand her resignation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=306.48s)]
*  The country's been engulfed in protests for weeks, and the government has responded with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=310.76s)]
*  a brutal crackdown. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=315.28s)]
*  Nearly 100 people were killed yesterday. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=317.12s)]
*  200 were killed last month. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=319.28s)]
*  Over 10,000 have been arrested. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=321.52s)]
*  The protests began as a peaceful demonstration by students who are frustrated over how civil [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=323.84s)]
*  service jobs are assigned. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=329.24s)]
*  But they've turned into violent clashes. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=331.48s)]
*  The police and all shades of security forces have been deployed on the streets of Dhaka [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  in heavy numbers. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=339.76s)]
*  So it's setting up to be a tense showdown in a protest that's already been quite deadly. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  Mujeeb Machal has been covering the protests for the Times. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=348.92s)]
*  This protest movement may have started about a particular issue, the jobs and the civil [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=352.08s)]
*  service, but it's become about much more than that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=358.0s)]
*  It's become about what's been sort of an entrenched authoritarianism during the 15 years of Prime [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=361.08s)]
*  Minister Sheikh Hasina. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  In her time in office, particularly in recent years, she has shrunk any space for free [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=369.92s)]
*  speech. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=375.92s)]
*  She has cracked down on her opposition in a way where she's bogged them down in court [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=376.92s)]
*  cases and sort of every time they've tried to hold protests, she's cracked down on them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=381.56s)]
*  So it feels that it is as much a more widespread anger over her authoritarian tendencies, but [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=386.56s)]
*  also over her mismanagement of the economy because the economy is stagnating now and [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=394.44s)]
*  a lot of people are feeling the pinch of it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=400.8s)]
*  On the government's part, Prime Minister Hasina has blamed the violence and the protests on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=404.12s)]
*  her sort of sworn political enemies. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=409.84s)]
*  She says this is not an organic student protest. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=413.08s)]
*  These are extremist groups and that is spreading what was a centralized peaceful protest on [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=415.56s)]
*  one issue into the kind of situation that is difficult to contain. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=421.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's created a especially dangerous phase right now in the country. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  And finally, in Paris this weekend, the race for fastest man in the world came down to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=439.56s)]
*  a photo finish. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=445.32s)]
*  They're watching. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=446.32s)]
*  They're looking. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=447.32s)]
*  Who has got this? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=448.32s)]
*  In the 100 meter dash, the US's Noah Lyles spent most of the race at the back of the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=451.12s)]
*  pack before surging in the final moments and crossing the finish line at nearly the same [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=455.71999999999997s)]
*  time as Jamaica's Kashane Thompson. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  Their race took less than 10 seconds, but examining the footage to figure out who won [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  took longer. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=469.12s)]
*  Lyles had the momentum and he's got it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=470.12s)]
*  Ultimately, Lyles was declared the winner by five thousandths of a second. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=474.08s)]
*  For the fastest woman in the world, their 100 meter race took place in the rain and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=480.16s)]
*  Saint Lucia's Julian Alfred took the gold. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  She beat out Team USA's Sha'Carri Richardson, who had been the favorite. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=488.3s)]
*  Richardson took silver. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=492.92s)]
*  And today, Simone Biles will put on her last performance in Paris with the finals in women's [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  floor exercise and balance beam. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=500.46000000000004s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=507.56s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a former close friend of Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=509.06s)]
*  Vance shares a first person account of how Vance's politics have evolved. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=513.74s)]

*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2oXHZh40Lk&t=524.1s)]
