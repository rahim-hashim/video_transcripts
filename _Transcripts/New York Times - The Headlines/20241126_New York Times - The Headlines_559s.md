# Trump’s Dramatic Tariff Plan, and a Cease-Fire Takes Shape in Lebanon
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=4.8s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, November 26th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=6.44s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=8.44s)]
*  Last night, Donald Trump announced dramatic plans to impose tariffs on all products coming [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=14.4s)]
*  into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China, a move that could upend the global economy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=19.52s)]
*  The president-elect said the tariffs would kick in on his first day in office, and products [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=26.16s)]
*  from Mexico and Canada would face a 25% surcharge. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=30.96s)]
*  Products from China would be subject to an additional 10%. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=35.36s)]
*  Together, the three countries account for more than a third of goods shipped in and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=38.56s)]
*  out of the U.S. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  The tariffs could scramble supply chains and add huge new costs for companies that do business [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  across those borders, in particular carmakers, farmers, and food packagers. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Tariffs for consumers could also spike. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=55.84s)]
*  For Trump, the plan is an ultimatum. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=58.56s)]
*  In his social media posts, he accused Canada and Mexico of allowing drugs and migrants [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  into the U.S., saying the tariffs would be in place, quote, until such time as drugs, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=66.44s)]
*  in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  He also accused China of shipping illegal drugs to the U.S. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=78.04s)]
*  Trump did impose some tariffs during his first term, but he also used the threat of them [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=82.36s)]
*  as a bargaining chip in negotiations before later backing down. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=86.76s)]
*  News of his plan has already set off alarm bells in Canada, Mexico, and China, and a [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=91.28s)]
*  spokesman for the Chinese embassy in D.C. said, quote, no one will win a trade war. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=95.96s)]
*  Special counsel Jack Smith has moved to effectively shut down the federal cases he brought against [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=100.92s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  He filed requests with judges in D.C. and Atlanta to dismiss them, one related to the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=115.68s)]
*  mishandling of classified documents, the other over Trump's alleged attempts to overturn [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=120.88s)]
*  the 2020 election. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=125.44s)]
*  The move was expected. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=127.44s)]
*  Smith made clear that his decision was not based on the merit of the cases, which he [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=129.67999999999998s)]
*  said, quote, the government stands fully behind, but instead on the Justice Department's longstanding [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=134.2s)]
*  policy to not pursue charges against a sitting president. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  Smith didn't close the door on the cases entirely. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  He asked for them to be dismissed without prejudice, leaving open a chance the charges [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=147.56s)]
*  could be refiled after Trump leaves office. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, inside of Trump's transition team, allegations are swirling around one of his [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=160.6s)]
*  top advisors. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  The president-elect's legal team found evidence that Boris Epstein asked potential nominees [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=168.2s)]
*  in the upcoming administration to pay him to promote them for the roles. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=173.6s)]
*  Their internal review found that Epstein proposed a $30,000 to $40,000 a month fee to Scott [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=178.6s)]
*  Besant, Trump's eventual pick for Treasury Secretary. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=183.56s)]
*  He also asked for $100,000 a month from a defense contractor who was being considered [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=187.34s)]
*  for a position. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=191.66s)]
*  Neither man paid him. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  Trump's legal team has recommended that Epstein's close access to Trump should be terminated. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=194.86s)]
*  In a statement, Epstein called the claims false and defamatory. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=199.7s)]
*  Israel is nearing a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=212.62s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated he's open to a deal that American officials [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=216.18s)]
*  have been pressuring him to finalize. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=220.58s)]
*  He's meeting today with his cabinet to decide whether to approve it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  Under the proposal, Israel would withdraw troops from Lebanon within 60 days, while [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=226.66s)]
*  Hezbollah's militia forces would move north, farther from the Israeli border. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=231.46s)]
*  The Lebanese army would then be deployed to create a buffer zone. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  For its part, Hezbollah has indicated it's also open to a ceasefire, and its biggest [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=239.44s)]
*  backer, Iran, has been pushing it to sign onto one. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel over a year ago in solidarity with Hamas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=248.34s)]
*  The conflict escalated when Israel invaded southern Lebanon and began carrying out widespread [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=253.62s)]
*  airstrikes, decimating Hezbollah's leadership. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=258.38s)]
*  Thousands have been killed in Lebanon, and about a million people have been displaced. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=262.34s)]
*  In Israel, nearly 100 people have been killed and 60,000 displaced. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=266.56s)]
*  In Pakistan, the country's capital is under lockdown as thousands of protesters have marched [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=274.26s)]
*  to the city to demand the release of the former prime minister Imran Khan, who's been in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=284.82s)]
*  prison for over a year on corruption charges. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  Major roads have been barricaded with shipping containers, and the army has been given orders [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=292.34s)]
*  to shoot protesters if needed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=296.46s)]
*  This is the latest in a series of protests since Khan was removed from power in 2022. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=299.18s)]
*  He's remained hugely popular and influential from behind bars, despite attempts by the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=304.7s)]
*  current military-backed government to suppress support for him. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=309.46s)]
*  Salman Masood, who covers Pakistan for the Times, spoke with some of the protesters. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=313.1s)]
*  They're saying that they are here till they manage to secure the release of Imran Khan, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=318.38s)]
*  no matter what, and they're willing to sit in the capital for days and weeks. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=324.1s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=329.5s)]
*  The Times has been looking at how the rise in Ozempic and other weight loss drugs like [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=336.66s)]
*  it has the junk food industry trying to figure out its next move. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  The drugs, commonly called GLP-1s, send signals to your brain that you're full, affecting [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=345.88s)]
*  how and what people eat. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=351.74s)]
*  One of the fascinating things that people kept telling me was they are not just eating [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=353.96s)]
*  less food, but they're eating different kinds of food. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  People seem to be eating less ultra-processed food, which I think is going to worry the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=361.44s)]
*  industry. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=366.28s)]
*  Thomas Weber spoke to weight loss drug users who said they now crave fresh produce, that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=367.28s)]
*  celery suddenly tastes flavorful, and that processed food tastes plasticky. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  There's a big question about why these taste changes are happening. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=378.56s)]
*  Some scientists are speculating that the drug interacts with the brain's reward system [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=381.68s)]
*  to turn down the dopamine hit. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=386.36s)]
*  That's why experiments have shown that it's also easier to resist alcohol and cigarettes [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=388.92s)]
*  and even cocaine while you're on these drugs. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=393.48s)]
*  Many of the ultra-processed foods have been engineered specifically to target that part [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  of the brain that the drugs then regulate. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=402.42s)]
*  Sales of sweet baked goods and snacks are already down. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=406.12s)]
*  While the pool of Ozempic users is too small to account for that, Thomas says companies [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=410.12s)]
*  aren't standing by watching the numbers slump. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=415.4s)]
*  They're determined to do their own research to find snacks that will still appeal to people, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=418.52s)]
*  even on GLP-1s. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=423.32s)]
*  For decades, right, big food has been trying to hack our taste buds in order to get us [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=424.32s)]
*  to eat more of their products. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=430.56s)]
*  And right now, the industry is busy trying to figure out what kinds of foods people on [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=432.6s)]
*  these drugs will crave. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=438.35999999999996s)]
*  Thomas had the chance to taste test what one company is trying to cook up. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  His full reporting is at NYTimes.com. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  And finally, just days after his bid to become attorney general collapsed, Matt Gaetz has [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=446.88s)]
*  picked up a new gig. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=463.23999999999995s)]
*  This is Matt Gaetz wishing happy birthday to Alan. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=464.84s)]
*  Man, you're turning 70 years old. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=468.23999999999995s)]
*  That is a big one. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=470.44s)]
*  He's selling videos of himself on Cameo, the site that lets people buy personalized messages [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=471.67999999999995s)]
*  from the famous and the infamous. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=478.12s)]
*  Congratulations for making partner at your law firm. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=480.4s)]
*  My legal career took a little bit of a different turn this last week. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=484.08s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=487.96s)]
*  Work hard, get paid a lot of money. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  In the videos, Gaetz has acknowledged that this isn't where he thought he would be. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  His path to the AG's office was cut short by allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=495.72s)]
*  drug use. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=500.44s)]
*  But the CEO of Cameo says there's no better time to hit record. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  He told the Times, quote, it's important to strike while the iron is hot when you're having [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=506.42s)]
*  your moment. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=510.68s)]
*  Gaetz is far from the only politician to join the thousands of reality stars and others [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  on Cameo. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=516.96s)]
*  Former New York representative George Santos started making videos right after being expelled [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=518.88s)]
*  from Congress last year. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=523.62s)]
*  He said he predicts Gaetz will rake it in. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aFN3HwBLA&t=525.72s)]
