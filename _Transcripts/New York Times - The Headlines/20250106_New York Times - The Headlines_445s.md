# Harris to Certify Trump’s Victory, and Driving in Manhattan Gets Pricier
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=0.0s)]
*  6th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=7.44s)]
*  Today at 1 p.m., a joint session of Congress is set to convene at the Capitol to certify [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=14.3s)]
*  the results of the presidential election. The process is largely ceremonial and was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=19.12s)]
*  for the most part uneventful until last time, January 6th, 2021, when rioters, fueled by [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=24.22s)]
*  Donald Trump's lies about a stolen election, broke into the building and disrupted the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=31.18s)]
*  event. The rioting led to the deaths of seven people, including three police officers. And [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=35.98s)]
*  there are reminders of that violence all over today. The Capitol will be on heavy lockdown [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=42.22s)]
*  with tall black metal fencing surrounding the building. But there's no hint of violence [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  breaking out this year. Kamala Harris has not disputed her loss to Trump. Today, she will be [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=52.3s)]
*  the one presiding over the certification in her role as president of the Senate. Congress has [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=58.26s)]
*  also overhauled the process to make clear that what Trump pushed his vice president, Mike Pence, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=63.78s)]
*  to do, to unilaterally throw out a state's electoral votes, is not allowed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=68.94s)]
*  Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin said today's process will, quote, be a lot more like what we've [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=73.58s)]
*  seen for the rest of American history. Meanwhile, more than 1600 people have been prosecuted in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=79.9s)]
*  connection with the riot at the Capitol that day. Some faced felonies like assault or seditious [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=87.26s)]
*  conspiracy. Hundreds were charged with lesser crimes. Trump has said that he plans to pardon [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=92.58000000000001s)]
*  those who were convicted. The promise of pardons is part of Trump's effort to rewrite the violent [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  history of that day. You might remember that immediately after the attack, Donald Trump called [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=104.38s)]
*  January 6th, and I'm quoting, a heinous attack on the United States Capitol. And he promised that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=112.06s)]
*  all the lawbreakers that day would pay. But as I followed this story, not only has Trump changed [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=119.82s)]
*  that narrative, changed his position on it, but he's come up with an alternate reality. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=129.05999999999997s)]
*  Today on The Daily, my colleague Alan Foyer looks at the whitewashing of January 6th. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=135.61999999999998s)]
*  As lawmakers gather in Washington today, they're facing a freezing winter storm that is barreled [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=147.22s)]
*  across the country from the plains to the East Coast. This weekend, snow, sleet, and freezing rain [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=152.74s)]
*  led to hundreds of flights being canceled or delayed in Kansas, Missouri, and Indiana. Tens [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=158.5s)]
*  of thousands of people have lost power along the storm's path, and highways have been blanketed in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=164.18s)]
*  ice. The storm has now pushed east towards the mid-Atlantic states. D.C.'s mayor declared a snow [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  emergency, and the area could see as much as nine inches of snow. The bad weather is supposed to move [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=175.38s)]
*  offshore later today, but meteorologists say brutally cold air will settle behind it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=181.14s)]
*  As Donald Trump moves closer to the White House, his legal team's been trying to fight one of the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  last remaining criminal cases against him, his New York felony conviction in the Hush Money case. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=197.05999999999997s)]
*  After multiple legal challenges, the judge in that case announced sentencing will move forward. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=203.06s)]
*  It's set for this Friday. Trump's conviction on 34 counts could have meant up to four years in prison, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=208.18s)]
*  but the judge has indicated that he will likely give Trump what's known as an unconditional [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=215.3s)]
*  discharge. It's a rarely used alternative to jail or probation that will let Trump go free [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  with no punishment. Trump's team is still expected to appeal his conviction and try to get it thrown [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=224.9s)]
*  out altogether. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=230.58s)]
*  This weekend in New York, a bold and controversial effort to reduce traffic and boost public [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=238.58s)]
*  transportation went into effect. The city became the first in the country to launch a congestion [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=244.02s)]
*  pricing program. Most cars entering the southern half of Manhattan now have to pay a $9 toll. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=250.18s)]
*  City officials have said it will cut down on pollution and gridlock and generate billions [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=257.3s)]
*  of dollars for upgrading the subway, trains, and buses, including making them more accessible [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=261.7s)]
*  for riders with disabilities. But legal challenges almost doomed the effort, and polls have shown [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=266.58s)]
*  that congestion pricing is largely unpopular in the city. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=272.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm so sorry to bother you. My name's Olivia. I'm a reporter. I'm here for the New York Times [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=276.18s)]
*  talking to people about congestion pricing. It sucks. It sucks. Tell me more about that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=279.78s)]
*  Olivia Ben-Symon, other Times reporters, were out getting reactions on the streets yesterday. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=284.5s)]
*  They hope that it's going to get people to use public transportation, which is fine, but the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=289.14s)]
*  problem is public transportation is appearing to be more and more dangerous. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=292.9s)]
*  Some people raise concerns about safety on public transit. There have been a number of violent attacks [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=297.29999999999995s)]
*  on the subway recently, including when a woman was set on fire last month. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  Others are worried about the cost of the program. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  It's a tax on the working class. I want to take my kids to Jersey. You know, it's going to be [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=309.38s)]
*  impossible for someone like me that has three kids to be able to take them out and to do anything [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=314.17999999999995s)]
*  with them anymore. Officials said the rollout of the new system went smoothly, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=320.98s)]
*  but the first major test of its impact on traffic in the city will come this morning during rush hour. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=327.94s)]
*  And finally, are you guys ready to kick this thing off? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  The Golden Globes were last night, the traditional glitzy start to award season. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  This year's ceremony was hosted by the comedian Nikki Glaser. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=353.85999999999996s)]
*  I like did not know much about wicked going into this year because I had friends in high school, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=357.06s)]
*  but I loved it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=361.06s)]
*  And while the absolutely inescapable wicked got some love, the awards veered way more towards [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=364.34s)]
*  movies that very few Americans have had a chance to see. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=370.58s)]
*  And the Golden Globe goes to the Brutalist. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=373.78s)]
*  Best drama went to the Brutalist, a historic epic about an architect after World War II, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=379.38s)]
*  which isn't even in wide release yet. The film is long enough that it has an intermission. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=385.14s)]
*  No one was asking for a three and a half hour film about a mid-century designer, but it works. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=390.58s)]
*  Director Brady Corbet acknowledged how much of a long shot his film was when he accepted the award. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=399.14s)]
*  Best comedy or musical then went to Amelia Perez, a Spanish language musical about a cartel boss [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=405.14s)]
*  who was transgender. The film is on Netflix and in just a few theaters. The Globes are usually seen [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=410.66s)]
*  as a preview of what could win big at the Oscars, but these big wins for little-seen movies don't [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=416.98s)]
*  offer a clear picture. Oscar nominations come out January 17th. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=423.06s)]
*  Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3b_yT8GxOw&t=432.90000000000003s)]
