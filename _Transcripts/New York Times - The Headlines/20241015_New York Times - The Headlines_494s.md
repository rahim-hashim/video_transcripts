# Optimism on Wall Street, and Harris Agrees to a Fox News Interview
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=4.72s)]
*  Today is Tuesday, October 15th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=5.72s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=8.44s)]
*  It's a big week on Wall Street, and the feeling so far is optimism. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=14.36s)]
*  Stocks have climbed since the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates a month ago, and the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=19.72s)]
*  market's been setting record highs, including another one yesterday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=24.0s)]
*  There had been a lot of hand-wringing over how the labor market is doing and high prices, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=28.46s)]
*  but the most recent data coming out has showed strong hiring numbers and milder inflation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=33.34s)]
*  This week, big companies like Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Netflix will open their [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=39.08s)]
*  books for their quarterly earning reports, data that could provide another checkup on [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=44.2s)]
*  where the economy is heading. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=49.22s)]
*  Earnings for big banks JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo came out last week. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=51.94s)]
*  Their profits were down, but their results were still stronger than anticipated, suggesting [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=56.68s)]
*  the economy's in solid shape. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=61.3s)]
*  Not every sector of the market has been growing equally. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=64.56s)]
*  A lot of the gains have been driven by giant tech companies who've gone big into AI. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=67.34s)]
*  But investors hope if the economy stays resilient, other areas outside tech will see growth as [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=72.94s)]
*  well. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris, who's come under scrutiny for either not doing interviews or doing them [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=85.36s)]
*  with less traditional outlets, has agreed to sit down with Fox News. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=89.6s)]
*  The network announced that the vice president will be interviewed tomorrow by Bret Baer, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=94.98s)]
*  its chief political anchor. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=99.04s)]
*  It will be Harris' first formal interview with Fox, whose conservative programming often [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=100.32s)]
*  explicitly supports her opponent, former President Donald Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  Harris is expected to field 25 to 30 minutes of questions, and it could be an opportunity [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=110.72s)]
*  for her to reach viewers who may be skeptical of her candidacy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=115.46s)]
*  Harris' interview, which will air at 6 p.m. Eastern tomorrow, will be shown on Fox the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=119.74s)]
*  same day the network airs in unusual town hall with Trump. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=124.94s)]
*  He's taping the event tonight in front of an all-female audience in Georgia, where he's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=129.36s)]
*  expected to field questions on abortion, childcare, daycare, and other quote, issues impacting [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=133.72s)]
*  women, according to Fox. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=139.98s)]
*  We will never tolerate the involvement of a foreign government threatening and killing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  Canadian citizens on Canadian soil, a deeply unacceptable violation of Canada's sovereignty [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  and of international law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=160.0s)]
*  Canada expelled India's top diplomat from the country, along with five others on Monday, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=163.16s)]
*  accusing them of being part of a vast criminal network targeting Canadian citizens who've [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=168.32s)]
*  criticized the Indian government. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=173.2s)]
*  The move immediately escalated tensions between the two countries and now runs the risk of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=175.56s)]
*  broadening into a wider international dispute. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  India and Canada have been at odds since last year when the outspoken Sikh cleric, Hardeeb [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=184.84s)]
*  Singh Najjar, was assassinated in Canada. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=190.16s)]
*  At the time, Canada blamed the Indian government for the killing, accusing them of running [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  covert operations against the religious minority in the country. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=197.84s)]
*  Canada fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=201.94s)]
*  We expect the Indian government to do the same for Canada. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=207.26s)]
*  During a press conference on Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said police had uncovered [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=212.26s)]
*  new evidence of those operations. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=216.84s)]
*  India has rejected the accusations, calling them politically motivated and immediately [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=219.82s)]
*  retaliated by ordering six Canadian diplomats to leave. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=223.98s)]
*  Times International correspondent, Matina Stevis-Gridneff, says the diplomatic expulsions [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  could now put more countries in an uncomfortable position. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=232.88s)]
*  Both Canada and India, while super different countries, are both what we would call middling [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  powers on the world stage. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=242.04s)]
*  Canada is a traditional Western player. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=244.56s)]
*  They're part of NATO, part of the G7. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=246.48s)]
*  And India is a huge country, an ascendant power on the global stage, and a power that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=249.78s)]
*  many of Canada's allies, such as the United States and European Union countries, want [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=255.9s)]
*  to have as a friend. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=260.82s)]
*  They want India to be their ally, both geopolitically, economically, and in trade terms. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=262.32s)]
*  And so I think because of the gravity of the allegations, this breakdown between Canada [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=267.7s)]
*  and India and their relationship makes things quite awkward. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=272.02s)]
*  It puts quite a lot of pressure on the allies of both countries to pick sides, and that's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=276.12s)]
*  going to be something the United States and others don't want to do. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=281.3s)]
*  And so that makes this problem in a way bigger than what it appears at first glance. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=284.54s)]
*  In Gaza, dozens of people were injured or killed by Israeli airstrikes yesterday, including [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=294.74s)]
*  one that hit the grounds of Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, according to health officials and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=299.86s)]
*  the UN. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=304.58s)]
*  Many families had set up camp in the hospital's parking lot, hoping that international laws [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=305.96s)]
*  prohibiting attacks on hospitals would mean it was safe. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=310.84s)]
*  Instead, the families tell the Times they've survived repeated attacks. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=314.52s)]
*  Monday's strike led to a fire that engulfed the camp. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=318.84s)]
*  People scrambled to try and put out the flames, which were fueled by canisters of cooking [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=322.56s)]
*  gas in the family's plastic tents. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=326.84s)]
*  A 20-year-old man living at the camp told the Times, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=329.2s)]
*  It's like living inside a recurring nightmare. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=336.84s)]
*  Every time we sleep, we wake up to the same scenario of tents struck, people screaming. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=339.82s)]
*  The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas command center near the hospital. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=346.02s)]
*  Israel's come under repeated criticism for hitting hospitals and other civilian infrastructure [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=351.02s)]
*  over the last year. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=355.38s)]
*  And in Lebanon, Israeli airstrikes are now overwhelming the health system there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=359.26s)]
*  The United Nations says some Lebanese hospitals have had to close due to damage. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=364.04s)]
*  Others have been abandoned after staff fled, fearing for their safety. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=368.74s)]
*  Israel's been mounting a major offensive in Lebanon after trading cross-border blows with [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=373.58s)]
*  Hezbollah for nearly a year. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=377.66s)]
*  The Israeli military's accused Hezbollah of embedding itself in civilian infrastructure, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=380.26s)]
*  including hospitals. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=384.54s)]
*  These officials and officials from the militant group have denied those claims. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=386.78s)]
*  And finally, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=400.44s)]
*  I think pandas are awesome. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=401.44s)]
*  I think it's a staple here in D.C. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=402.44s)]
*  A lot of excitement's been building for the return of pandas to the National Zoo. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  We are so, so excited to have them back. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=409.46s)]
*  It's been a little bit of a bummer without them. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=411.38s)]
*  They're part of a long-running collaboration between the U.S. and China, so-called panda [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=414.78s)]
*  diplomacy, which some had worried would end because of frosty relations between the two [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=419.46s)]
*  countries. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  But as the pandas arrive in D.C., a new investigation from the Times has uncovered some troubling [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=425.34s)]
*  realities about the panda program. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=430.58s)]
*  It started in the 90s with China sending pandas abroad in the hopes that foreign zoos would [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=433.88s)]
*  breed them and they'd be released into the wild. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=438.85999999999996s)]
*  Over the last three decades, more pandas have been moved into captivity than have been released. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=442.79999999999995s)]
*  Aggressive attempts to have the pandas breed has injured some animals. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=448.56s)]
*  And while the whole thing is explicitly supposed to be a conservation effort, not a financial [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  arrangement, the Times investigation found that money has been at the center of the conversation [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=458.35999999999996s)]
*  from the beginning. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  You can find the full investigation into the panda program at nytimes.com. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=473.52s)]
*  Today on The Daily, how control of the House of Representatives could hinge on what happens [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  in two deeply blue states. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=488.76s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCbucwJUFnM&t=489.76s)]
