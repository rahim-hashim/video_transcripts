# American Children Sent to Honduras, and A.I. on the Battlefield
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, April [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=0.0s)]
*  28th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=7.0s)]
*  Immigration advocates are sounding the alarm about some of the Trump administration's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=14.32s)]
*  latest deportations, warning that children who are American citizens have been caught [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=18.04s)]
*  up in the crackdown. They're pointing to two cases out of Louisiana in the last week. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=23.5s)]
*  In both, women who were undocumented were detained along with their children after showing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=29.02s)]
*  up for routine check-ins with ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One woman was then [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=34.26s)]
*  sent to Honduras with her four-year-old and seven-year-old who have U.S. citizenship. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  The other was also sent there, along with her two-year-old who's a U.S. citizen. Lawyers [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=44.58s)]
*  for both families say the mothers were not given the option to leave their kids in the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  U.S. and that they weren't even able to communicate with their lawyers until after they'd arrived [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=53.78s)]
*  in Central America. In the case of the two-year-old, the child's father had filed an emergency [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=58.18s)]
*  petition to try and keep his daughter in the U.S., but she was flown to Honduras anyway. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=63.32s)]
*  A federal judge overseeing the case wrote that he had a, quote, strong suspicion that [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=68.86s)]
*  the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process. In an interview [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=73.78s)]
*  on CBS yesterday, President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, pushed back on that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=79.18s)]
*  The mom signed a paper saying, I want my two-year-old to go with me. That's a parent's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=84.58s)]
*  decision. It's not a government decision. It's a parent's decision. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=88.38s)]
*  But Homan also warned other parents who are undocumented that their families may face [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=91.46s)]
*  consequences too. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=95.78s)]
*  Having a U.S. citizen child doesn't make you immune from our laws of the country. American [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=97.84s)]
*  families get separated every day by law enforcement. Thousands of times a day when a parent gets [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=101.86s)]
*  put in jail, the child can't go with them. If you're an illegal immigrant from this country [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=106.14s)]
*  you decide to have your citizen child. That's on you. You put yourself in that position. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=110.34s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=117.34s)]
*  Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=118.34s)]
*  Hundreds of people gathered in Wisconsin this weekend to protest the Trump administration's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  decision to arrest a judge for allegedly obstructing its deportation efforts. On Friday, the FBI [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  detained Hannah Dugan, a county judge in Milwaukee, and accused her of guiding an undocumented [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=136.1s)]
*  immigrant out the side door of her courtroom after she found out that ICE agents were standing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=141.66s)]
*  by waiting to arrest him. He was later apprehended outside the courthouse. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=146.5s)]
*  The director of the FBI, Cash Patel, posted a photo of the judge online showing her in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=151.42s)]
*  handcuffs, and he wrote, quote, No one is above the law. She's since been released [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=156.38s)]
*  and has a hearing scheduled for next month. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=161.58s)]
*  We think we brought the sides closer than they've been in a very long time, but we're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  not there yet and it needs to start happening. I think this is going to be a very critical [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=173.10000000000002s)]
*  week. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the U.S. will decide this week whether or not to give [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=178.26000000000002s)]
*  up on its efforts to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  We don't walk away from something that can actually work or that can actually lead to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=186.4s)]
*  peace, but we also don't want to continue to spend time on something that's not going [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=190.22s)]
*  to get us there. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=194.22s)]
*  He told NBC's Meet the Press that the U.S. was close, but not close enough, to negotiating [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=195.34s)]
*  a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. It wasn't clear, though, if Rubio's deadline [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=200.36s)]
*  was simply an effort to pressure the two sides to make a deal or if the administration might [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=205.14s)]
*  actually pull back from negotiations altogether if there's no progress. In the past few days, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=210.46s)]
*  Trump sent his special envoy to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They talked [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=217.1s)]
*  for three hours in Moscow. And Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=221.66s)]
*  personally while they were both at the Vatican for Pope Francis's funeral. Officials haven't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=226.54s)]
*  said what, if anything, came out of those discussions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  Trump's visit to Italy was his first foreign trip this term. It lasted just 14 hours, with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=236.45999999999998s)]
*  leaving shortly after the funeral. The Times learned that he told his aides he wanted to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=242.78s)]
*  be back at his golf club in New Jersey by the end of the day. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=247.22s)]
*  In Canada today, voters will head to the polls for an election that's broadly considered [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=259.3s)]
*  one of the most important in a generation. It will determine who leads the country as [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=263.54s)]
*  prime minister at a time when Canada is facing a cost of living crisis and an unexpected [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=268.34s)]
*  trade war with the U.S. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  We've got to face up to Trump. I've got the experience of managing crisis. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=275.73999999999995s)]
*  The top two contenders are the leader of the Liberal Party, Mark Carney, took over from [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=280.46s)]
*  Justin Trudeau, and the leader of the Conservative Party, Pierre Poliev. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  Who's voting for safe streets for a change? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=289.38s)]
*  Many voters are making their decision based on who they think is best positioned to stand [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=294.26s)]
*  up to the U.S., not only on tariffs, but also to President Trump's repeated threats to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=298.74s)]
*  make Canada the 51st state. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=303.98s)]
*  One thing to note about this election is what's happening on social media. Go on Facebook [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=306.98s)]
*  or Instagram in Canada, and there are no news articles about the election. Metta, which [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=311.5s)]
*  owns both of those platforms, blocked news on its apps in Canada back in 2023 after a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=317.62s)]
*  new law required social media companies to pay news outlets for publishing their content. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=323.6s)]
*  Instead of paying, Metta made news unavailable. The situation has created a news void, and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=330.12s)]
*  dozens of partisan pages, especially right-wing ones, have stepped in to fill it, sharing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=336.16s)]
*  misleading posts that can go viral and running ads that mimic legitimate news sources. One [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=341.16s)]
*  page, Canada Proud, now has more followers than either of the country's major parties, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  and its posts have taken particular aim at Carney, the liberal leader. And most Canadians [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=352.28s)]
*  aren't aware that what they're seeing online has changed. Research shows only one in five [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  Canadians knows that news has been blocked on Facebook and Instagram. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=362.26s)]
*  In Israel, the country's military has a history of testing new technologies out in the field. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=371.88s)]
*  It was among the first to experiment with drones and to pioneer spyware for hacking [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=377.8s)]
*  into cell phones for intelligence gathering. And in Gaza, the Israeli military's used [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=382.36s)]
*  the territory as a testing ground for artificial intelligence. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=387.56s)]
*  Some of the tools being developed by Israel include facial recognition that's powered [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=391.76s)]
*  by AI and can recognize people in real time. They developed an AI tool that can quickly [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=395.48s)]
*  sort through data and help them pick targets for bombing campaigns. And a new AI audio [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=401.04s)]
*  tool will help them locate some of Hamas's top militants. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=406.32s)]
*  My colleague Shira Frankel, along with Natan Otermeier, has been looking at Israel's developments [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=409.68s)]
*  in AI. Several Israeli officials told her new technologies were cleared for use after [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=414.12s)]
*  October 7th, and they moved quickly to develop more. They even pulled in reserve soldiers [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=419.78s)]
*  who had day jobs at tech companies like Microsoft and Google to add their expertise. That's [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  made Israel among the first militaries in the world to use the tools, giving a preview [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=431.6s)]
*  of what's possible and what can go wrong. Facial recognitions led to some mistaken identifications [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=436.44s)]
*  and arrests of Palestinians, and other AI technology has led to civilian deaths, according [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=443.40000000000003s)]
*  to Israeli officials. That's raised some concerns among Israel's allies. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  Some of the questions being raised by American and European defense officials are whether [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel is using tools that are too experimental in a real time battlefield. When it comes [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=458.44s)]
*  to the use of AI in a war, those small errors or those small false positives can cost real [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=463.24s)]
*  human lives. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=470.04s)]
*  And finally, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=482.0s)]
*  Here's my day off as a D1 athlete. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=483.0s)]
*  Okay, so first off, I'm definitely going to need to pick up some new lounging pieces [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=485.2s)]
*  and athletics are top tier. Ever since the NCAA changed its rules to let college athletes [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  make money from sponsorships and endorsements, social media has seen the rise of the student-athlete [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=495.84s)]
*  influencer. That's where the Uber One for Students membership to save on Uber and UberEats [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=502.24s)]
*  comes in clutch. Some students have racked up millions of followers and are earning hundreds [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=507.08s)]
*  of thousands of dollars for branded posts. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=511.68s)]
*  What I've been looking at is the next phase of this trend, which is colleges actually [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=514.76s)]
*  trying to help a ton of their student athletes become social media stars. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=518.76s)]
*  Sapna Maharswari is a tech reporter at the Times. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=522.96s)]
*  I went down to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a huge sports school, where [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=525.36s)]
*  there's a firm that is basically giving presentations to student athletes and telling them how much [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=529.92s)]
*  money there is to be made in social media, how they can become influencers. They're handing [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=535.76s)]
*  out 50 page documents saying, you know, here's how to make a great TikTok. Here's how to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=540.84s)]
*  make a compelling Instagram. And what they're teaching these students is that once they [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  build a big profile, they can also connect with brands and make a few thousand dollars. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=549.5600000000001s)]
*  Sapna says that while the schools don't make money when their athletes sign these kinds [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEBR91l9a4&t=554.76s)]
