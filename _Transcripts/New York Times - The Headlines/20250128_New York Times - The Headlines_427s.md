# Trump’s Freezing Spree, and an ‘Invisible Threat’ in L.A.
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=4.68s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, January 28th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=8.36s)]
*  On Monday, Donald Trump pushed the bounds of presidential power as he moved to bring [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=13.72s)]
*  the federal government in line with his agenda. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=18.92s)]
*  Trump's acting attorney general fired more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=22.56s)]
*  criminal investigations into Trump, making good on the president's vows for retribution. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=26.92s)]
*  The Justice Department said in a statement that those who were fired could not be trusted [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=33.22s)]
*  to, quote, faithfully implement Trump's agenda. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  The move is unprecedented, and experts say it undercuts decades of civil service law, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=41.28s)]
*  which says federal employees can only be fired for misconduct or poor performance. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  In another sweeping move, the White House took aim at a slew of government programs, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=52.36s)]
*  ordering an immediate pause to all grants, loans, and federal financial assistance. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=57.56s)]
*  Exactly what that includes is unclear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=63.24s)]
*  The Trump administration says it won't affect Medicare or Social Security benefits, but [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=65.56s)]
*  it potentially freezes hundreds of billions of dollars intended for state and local governments, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=69.92s)]
*  disaster relief aid, education funding, and small business loans. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=75.2s)]
*  The Budget Office says the pause is necessary so it can review all of the spending and make [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=80.0s)]
*  sure it's consistent with Trump's policy priorities. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=84.68s)]
*  Whether Trump's administration has the authority to unilaterally halt funding that's already [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=88.44s)]
*  been allocated by Congress is unclear. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=92.8s)]
*  Under the Constitution, Congress passes the spending bills. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=95.9s)]
*  The president is supposed to execute them as written. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=99.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Trump administration has also targeted foreign aid, pausing nearly all aid [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=110.96s)]
*  payments to other countries. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=116.6s)]
*  That includes support for a high-profile American health initiative aimed at fighting HIV worldwide. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=118.76s)]
*  The program, known as PEPFAR, was started by George W. Bush and is estimated to have [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=125.28s)]
*  saved as many as 25 million lives in 54 countries. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=130.16s)]
*  Last night, the Trump administration went beyond just pausing the program's funding. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=134.88s)]
*  It shut down access to all of the program's data and reports and directed overseas clinics [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=139.44s)]
*  to stop distributing HIV medications that were paid for with U.S. money, even if the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=144.64s)]
*  medications were already sitting in the clinics ready to be used. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=149.92s)]
*  The stock market's open just a few minutes ago and it's not pretty. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=160.48s)]
*  Artificial intelligence took a real hit today as American companies faced the emergence [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=165.0s)]
*  of a new AI app from China. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=169.24s)]
*  Let's talk about DeepSeek because it is mind-blowing and it is shaking this entire industry to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=171.88s)]
*  its core. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  Last week, DeepSeek was a relatively obscure Chinese startup working on AI. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  But on Monday, it shook the global economy, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  in tech stocks. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=189.4s)]
*  The company has investors reeling because it undercuts some of the major assumptions [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  about what it takes to develop AI. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=195.84s)]
*  U.S. companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta have said the key to success is computer [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=198.56s)]
*  chips. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  The more chips you have, the more powerful your AI product. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  That's led to billion-dollar investments in chipmakers like NVIDIA, which has become [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=208.64s)]
*  one of the most valuable companies on Earth in the last few years. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=213.0s)]
*  But DeepSeek says its new AI model, which rivals competitors like ChatGPT, was made [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=217.24s)]
*  with just a fraction of the chips that U.S. makers rely on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=223.28s)]
*  Chat has Wall Street rethinking whether the biggest players in the field were overhyped [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=227.64s)]
*  and overvalued. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  It's also raised questions about America's dominance in AI and whether China might now [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  cut into that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=238.88s)]
*  Mark Andreessen, one of Silicon Valley's biggest tech investors, compared the emergence [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  of DeepSeek to the space race of the 20th century, calling its launch, quote, AI's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=245.11999999999998s)]
*  Sputnik moment. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=251.27999999999997s)]
*  For more on DeepSeek, listen to the latest episode of Hard Fork with Time's tech columnist [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=254.16s)]
*  Kevin Roos. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=258.88s)]
*  I think this is a broader story than just the stock market. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=259.88s)]
*  I think it has tons of implications for other companies developing in AI and also for concerns [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=263.2s)]
*  that a lot of people working on AI safety have about how this technology could get out [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  of hand. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=275.24s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=276.24s)]
*  In Los Angeles, scientists and city officials are warning about the potential health impacts [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=284.16s)]
*  from this month's fires. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  Unlike wildfires in remote areas that mostly burn through brush and trees, these fires [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  tore through entire neighborhoods, melting plastics, chemicals, and asbestos. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  They also released lead from paint and old pipes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  The Times got detailed air quality measurements from the worst days of the fires. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  They showed that concentrations of lead and chlorine in the air briefly surged to dangerous [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=312.92s)]
*  levels. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=318.72s)]
*  Some toxins may also linger in homes near the burned out areas. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  One woman in Alta Dena said her mattress, couch, and rugs smelled like a chemical campfire. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  Other residents who've been returning say they feel like they're facing an invisible [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=330.0s)]
*  threat. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Overall, it could take years for the full health impact of the fires to become clear, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  and the toxins could eventually drive up the death toll. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=339.76s)]
*  And finally, smugglers have tried to drive it across the border, sneak it through the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=347.08s)]
*  airports, send it in the mail. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  U.S. customs officials have had to seize it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=353.36s)]
*  It's haggis. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=356.2s)]
*  The traditional and slightly divisive Scottish dish of sheep innards, oatmeal, and spices, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  all stuffed into a sheep's stomach, has been banned in the U.S. since the 1970s because [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=363.36s)]
*  of food safety concerns. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=368.62s)]
*  The Department of Agriculture forbids producing or importing any foods with one of haggis's [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=371.02s)]
*  key ingredients, sheep lungs, which are ground up in the filling. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=375.9s)]
*  Now, after years of trying and failing to get the ban overturned, one company in Scotland [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=380.86s)]
*  has decided to compromise on their recipe to break into the American market. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=386.68s)]
*  McSween has developed a new haggis that replaces sheep lung with lamb heart, which you can [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=391.98s)]
*  import into the U.S. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  It'll hit stores next year. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=399.9s)]
*  One butcher told the Times, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=402.26s)]
*  Do I think that there's something to be said for textural difference that the lung [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=403.82s)]
*  adds to it? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=407.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=408.58s)]
*  Do I think the average consumer is going to notice? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=409.58s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=412.09999999999997s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=415.5s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=416.5s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1si4LLqAz-E&t=417.5s)]
