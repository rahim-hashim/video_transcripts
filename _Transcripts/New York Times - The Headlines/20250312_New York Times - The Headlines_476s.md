# Gutting the Education Department, and a Trump Tesla Show
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=4.96s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, March 12th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Now, is this the first step on the road to a total shutdown? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=11.84s)]
*  Yes, actually it is because that was the president's mandate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=18.36s)]
*  This directive to me clearly is to shut down the Department of Education, which we know [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=22.72s)]
*  The Trump administration's effort to radically upend the federal government has reached the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=26.84s)]
*  Education Department. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=31.12s)]
*  The department announced yesterday that it's firing more than 1300 workers, bringing staffing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=32.88s)]
*  levels down to half of what they were when President Trump took office. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=38.24s)]
*  And in an interview on Fox News, Trump's new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, said [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  a total elimination of the agency is in the works. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  Better education is closest to the kids, with parents, with local superintendents, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=51.32s)]
*  with local school boards. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=56.76s)]
*  McMahon said state and local governments should be the ones overseeing the education system [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=58.12s)]
*  instead. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=62.8s)]
*  Despite the gutting, McMahon said several functions of the department will continue [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=64.36s)]
*  in some form, including managing federal student loans, tracking student achievement, and distributing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=68.6s)]
*  funds for special needs students. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=74.58s)]
*  But the president of the country's largest teachers union warned the cuts will raise [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=77.12s)]
*  the costs of higher education and that, quote, the real victims will be our most vulnerable [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=81.08s)]
*  students. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=86.16s)]
*  Some of the steepest cuts to the department have hit its Office of Civil Rights. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=87.52s)]
*  If the administration moves to shut the department down completely, as it has said it intends [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=92.04s)]
*  to, that will be a direct challenge to the authority of Congress, which created the department [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=96.72s)]
*  and by law would have to agree to close it down. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=102.64s)]
*  And in another major cut, the Times has learned that the Environmental Protection Agency is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=105.8s)]
*  shutting down its environmental justice offices. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=114.36s)]
*  They were stationed across the country and tasked with addressing high levels of pollution [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  in poor and minority communities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=123.28s)]
*  Those communities are often located near highways, industrial plants, and other areas that can [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=125.72s)]
*  lead to health issues. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=130.72s)]
*  An EPA spokeswoman said closing the offices will save money and that it's part of Trump's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=132.56s)]
*  push to roll back DEI initiatives. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  Even before the cuts, the administration was already turning away from this kind of work. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=141.08s)]
*  Last week, it dropped a federal lawsuit against a chemical plant in Louisiana. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=146.28s)]
*  The suit had claimed the plant was driving up cancer rates among black residents who [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=150.68s)]
*  live nearby. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=155.08s)]
*  Now, three quick updates on stories we've been tracking. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=162.08s)]
*  The U.S. announced it will immediately restart military aid to Ukraine after the two countries [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=169.56s)]
*  met for talks yesterday about how to end the war with Russia. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  As part of the negotiations, the U.S. and Ukraine also settled on a 30-day ceasefire [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  proposal that Secretary of State Marco Rubio said they'll now send to Moscow. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=183.72000000000003s)]
*  And we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=188.8s)]
*  The ball's now in their court and we hope the Russians will reciprocate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=191.08s)]
*  In Washington, House Republicans narrowly passed their stopgap funding measure to head [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  off a government shutdown. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  The bill's now headed to the Senate for what will likely be another close vote. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=208.4s)]
*  If it passes, it will keep the government funded until September 30th. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=213.16000000000003s)]
*  If not, a shutdown will begin Friday at midnight. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=217.02s)]
*  And on the trade front, President Trump's new 25 percent tariffs on foreign steel and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=222.62s)]
*  aluminum went into effect this morning. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=227.94s)]
*  Trump put similar tariffs in place during his first term. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=231.34s)]
*  And my colleague Peter Eves says that U.S. steel and aluminum companies are glad to have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=234.22s)]
*  them back. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=238.9s)]
*  They say that they will give them protection from cheap imports that are being, in their [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=240.18s)]
*  view, dumped in the United States at below market prices. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=246.42s)]
*  And they will be able to invest more in their plants and hire more people. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=250.61999999999998s)]
*  This happened to some extent during the first Trump administration, but it remains to be [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=256.09999999999997s)]
*  seen whether it will happen again. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=260.3s)]
*  When it comes to consumers, trade groups are warning that the tariffs on metals could lead [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=262.78s)]
*  to higher prices on cars, tools, canned goods and other products. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=266.82s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  What's your best of these cars? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=277.90000000000003s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=279.5s)]
*  Well, the car that I drive is the Model S Class B. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=280.5s)]
*  Which is that one? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=282.74s)]
*  That red one in the middle. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=283.74s)]
*  I like that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=284.74s)]
*  President Trump put on an extraordinary show yesterday to help boost Tesla, Elon Musk's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=285.74s)]
*  electric car company. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=291.88s)]
*  In what was part press conference, part sales pitch, Trump showed off five Tesla models [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=293.74s)]
*  parked in the White House's driveway. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  He's built this great company and he shouldn't be penalized because he's a patriot. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=301.54s)]
*  He's an incredible patriot. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=305.38s)]
*  Trump said he didn't like that Musk has taken a lot of criticism in recent weeks as the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=307.1s)]
*  face of the administration's massive cuts. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=311.3s)]
*  Tesla and its vehicles have become a target. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  There's been vandalism at dealerships and slumping sales. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=316.86s)]
*  In defending Musk, Trump even announced he was buying one of the cars. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=320.38s)]
*  I'm president, so I want to pay full price. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=324.9s)]
*  While there are rules against executive branch employees promoting or endorsing products [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=328.26s)]
*  on behalf of friends or relatives, they do not apply to the president. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=332.54s)]
*  On Musk's part, he has signaled to Trump's advisors in recent days that he wants to put [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=337.58000000000004s)]
*  $100 million into Trump's political operation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=342.22s)]
*  It's not exactly clear what the money will go towards, but it could be used to help boost [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=346.26000000000005s)]
*  candidates who support the president's agenda. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  During the last election, Musk spent close to $300 million backing Trump. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=353.42s)]
*  And finally. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=362.54s)]
*  This week, the first fully animated Looney Tunes original movie will hit theaters. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=370.06s)]
*  Space Jam doesn't count. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=375.02000000000004s)]
*  In this movie, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig will be getting their star moment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  It's also a breakout moment for the actor doing their voices. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  Most of the iconic Looney Tunes voices were created nearly 90 years ago by Mel Blank. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=388.98s)]
*  He was dubbed the man of a thousand voices, and he did all of the big ones for decades [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=394.38s)]
*  and decades. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=398.58000000000004s)]
*  Bugs Bunny, Tweety, Yosemite Sam, Taz. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=399.58000000000004s)]
*  But the time sat down with the performer who is taking up the mantle, Eric Bowser. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=403.3s)]
*  Listen, Buster. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=408.22s)]
*  Don't listen to that other guy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=409.82s)]
*  Listen to me. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  I know what I'm talking about. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  Bowser voices Daffy and Porky in the new movie called The Day the Earth Blew Up. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=414.18s)]
*  He got into the film industry first as an animator, but said he's done funny voices [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=419.66s)]
*  ever since he was a kid. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  And a few years ago, when he was asked to audition for a Looney Tunes project, he fully [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=426.02s)]
*  committed. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=430.58s)]
*  He brought carrots into the studio and ate them while doing the Bugs voice. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=431.58s)]
*  Still, Bowser says his actual dream is to come up with an entirely new voice that will [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=436.02s)]
*  become as famous as the characters he's doing now. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=441.38s)]
*  Doing all these voices is getting me tired. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=445.5s)]
*  And on that note, that's all, folks. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=448.86s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=454.78s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at the epicenter of the measles outbreak in West Texas. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=455.78s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=462.02s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=466.62s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgphUKYOTw&t=467.62s)]
