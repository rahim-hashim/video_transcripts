# An ‘Aggressive’ Trip to Greenland, and the Pope Returns Home
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=4.76s)]
*  Today's Monday, March 24th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The Trump administration has announced U.S. officials will make two trips to Greenland [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=14.14s)]
*  this week, alarming the territory's prime minister, who called the move highly aggressive [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=18.52s)]
*  and an attempt to demonstrate power over us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=24.04s)]
*  President Trump has vowed to make Greenland, which is a Danish territory, part of the United [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=27.76s)]
*  States, quote, one way or the other. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  His administration has cited national security interests in the Arctic, and they've also [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=35.14s)]
*  eyed the island's lucrative rare earth minerals. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=39.52s)]
*  In the first trip, National Security Advisor Mike Walz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=42.84s)]
*  will visit a U.S. military base there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  Then, I'm so excited to share that I'll be visiting Kalahui, Greenland. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Second Lady Usha Vance will arrive on the island to watch a national dog sled race. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=54.72s)]
*  She announced her trip in a social media post. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=59.76s)]
*  I'm also coming to celebrate the long history of mutual respect and cooperation between [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=62.16s)]
*  our nations and to express hope that our relationship will only grow stronger in the coming years. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=66.32s)]
*  While the Trump administration has presented her visit as a friendly one, Greenland's [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=71.92s)]
*  prime minister rejected that, saying, quote, we are now at a point where it can no longer [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=75.88s)]
*  be described as an innocent visit from a politician's spouse. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=80.48s)]
*  He added, the international community must now react. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=84.4s)]
*  Today, the U.S. is holding talks with Russian officials to try and iron out the details [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  of a possible limited ceasefire in Ukraine. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=97.48s)]
*  The U.S. spoke to Ukrainian officials yesterday. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  As of now, both sides have agreed to the idea of halting attacks on energy infrastructure [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=103.76s)]
*  for 30 days. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=108.88s)]
*  But the attacks have continued. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=110.48s)]
*  Our job is to narrow the issues, bring the parties together and stop the killing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  That's the game plan. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, who President Trump has sent to meet with Vladimir Putin twice, said in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=119.52s)]
*  an interview on Fox News that the hope is to hammer out this temporary truce first, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=124.24s)]
*  which will allow time to negotiate a more permanent end to the fighting. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=129.2s)]
*  But analysts say Putin may just be stalling. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=133.28s)]
*  Russia is earning goodwill with Washington for participating in the talks, but has shown [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=136.56s)]
*  no sign of slowing its offensive. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=141.2s)]
*  Over the weekend, Russia launched nearly 150 armed drones at Ukraine, according to the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=143.44s)]
*  Ukrainian Air Force. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=148.48s)]
*  The attacks killed at least three people in Kyiv. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=149.84s)]
*  In Rome, Pope Francis made his first public appearance in more than six weeks after being [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=152.16s)]
*  hospitalized for multiple respiratory infections. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=157.28s)]
*  A crowd of people gathered to see him and chanted his name as he was brought out onto [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=160.72s)]
*  the balcony of the hospital in a wheelchair, looking frail. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=165.28s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get out of this hospital. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=168.32s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get out of this hospital. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=172.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get out of this hospital. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=176.0s)]
*  He spoke briefly in a voice that was thin and raspy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=180.24s)]
*  Doctors say that the 88-year-old pope had been in such critical condition that he was [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=189.68s)]
*  on the verge of death twice while being treated. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=194.72s)]
*  They say he'll need to recover for two more months at home and limit meetings with large [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=197.28s)]
*  groups to avoid reinfection. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=202.08s)]
*  A sharp turnabout from what used to be the pope's packed public schedule. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=204.0s)]
*  In online shopping, a different kind of payment method is becoming more and more prevalent. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=210.0s)]
*  For several years, consumers have seen the buy now, pay later option pop up when they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=221.12s)]
*  shop for clothes, electronics, maybe even plane tickets. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=225.68s)]
*  The option lets people pay off big purchases in multiple installments with no interest. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=230.0s)]
*  But increasingly, the option is being offered for small ticket items. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=235.72s)]
*  This past week, the payment company Klarna said it's bringing its buy now, pay later [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=240.32s)]
*  service to DoorDash, the food delivery app. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=244.92s)]
*  It already partners with Uber Eats and Instacart. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=248.4s)]
*  So now people who've racked up a charge for a late night burrito delivery or pizza will [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=251.48s)]
*  be able to take out a loan to cover it, as long as it meets the $35 minimum. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=256.08s)]
*  The companies who offer these services say they're a better deal than credit cards because [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=261.06s)]
*  they don't charge interest, only late fees. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=265.32s)]
*  But their growing popularity has raised concerns among consumer advocates that users will get [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=268.4s)]
*  caught up in a cycle of small loan after small loan. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=273.4s)]
*  Research has shown that the buy now, pay later feature is most often used by people already [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  in debt. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=281.96s)]
*  And finally, legendary boxer George Foreman died Friday at 76. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=288.68s)]
*  He leaves behind a legacy in the ring where he once fought Muhammad Ali and later became [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=294.02s)]
*  the oldest heavyweight champion ever after a shocking comeback in his 40s. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=299.18s)]
*  But Foreman also leaves behind a legacy in the kitchen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=304.26s)]
*  Had a busy day. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=307.18s)]
*  My lean, mean, fat-reducing grilling machine is great to come home to. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=309.02s)]
*  You know, this is not the person you would think would come into America's culinary [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  scene and change its trajectory, right? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=317.06s)]
*  It was just such an unexpected partnership. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=320.58s)]
*  My colleague Kim Severson covers the culture of food in the US. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=323.98s)]
*  She says as Foreman stepped away from boxing, he turned to evangelical preaching and the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=328.14000000000004s)]
*  charisma that he developed at the pulpit gave way to commercials. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=333.46000000000004s)]
*  By the mid 90s, companies were sending him all kinds of products for him to consider [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=337.38s)]
*  endorsing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=341.34000000000003s)]
*  A company had sent this contraption that was two metal plates with a floating hinge so [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  you could adjust it to different size hamburger patties. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=348.14000000000004s)]
*  He put it on a shelf. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=351.48s)]
*  He thought it was kind of a piece of junk, but his wife Mary made him a couple hamburgers [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=352.48s)]
*  in it and said, this thing is great. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=357.12s)]
*  I love this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  So he decided that they could use his name on these grills. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  And it landed at this particular moment. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=365.26s)]
*  Food Network had just started. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  People were really into watching food on television, but it was also just peak infomercial time. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=369.22s)]
*  QVC was getting going. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  Infomercials were really big. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=378.0s)]
*  The perfect landscape for something like this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=379.28s)]
*  And this particular period of the 90s was America's low fat era, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  That was the thing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=386.76s)]
*  And the little innovation of this grill was that it had little channels on a metal plate [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=388.11999999999995s)]
*  and it was tilted 20 degrees. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=393.4s)]
*  So you could cook your burger and the fat would miraculously roll off into this little [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=395.73999999999995s)]
*  plastic container at the base of the machine. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=400.96s)]
*  So low fat cooking, convenient, it had everything. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=404.0s)]
*  And the thing about George Foreman is he was a very macho guy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=409.08s)]
*  So there's something appealing about this big former boxer saying, hey guys, go in the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  kitchen. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  You can cook with this. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  And it gave men all kinds of permission to fall in love with a kitchen gadget. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  Within the first year, they were selling $5 million worth. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  And eventually the company would sell more than 100 million of the George Foreman grill. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=429.68s)]
*  And it's such a ubiquitous piece of the culinary fabric of America that the original 1996 version [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=433.36s)]
*  is on display at the Smithsonian next to the first crock pot, the first microwave and Julia [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  Child's entire kitchen. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=446.8s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=453.92s)]
*  Today on The Daily, how President Trump's attacks on universities, including major funding [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  cuts, could change the future of higher education. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=464.84s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=469.28s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7Lsb-VfWw&t=470.28s)]
