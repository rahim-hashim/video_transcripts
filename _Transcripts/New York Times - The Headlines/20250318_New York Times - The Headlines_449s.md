# Deadly New Strikes in Gaza, and Abortion Arrests in Texas
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, March 18th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=6.48s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=8.36s)]
*  It feels like we have returned to some of the bloodiest moments of the war. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=13.68s)]
*  Our colleague in Gaza, Bilal Shabir, woke to the terrifying sound of explosions near [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=23.4s)]
*  his home in central Gaza. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=29.84s)]
*  The walls, he said, began to shake and very quickly he realized that war had returned. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=33.12s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley, the Times Jerusalem bureau chief, says Israel has launched a new large-scale [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  attack in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=46.12s)]
*  The strikes began overnight and have killed more than 400 people, according to the Gaza [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Health Ministry. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=53.28s)]
*  It's the largest wave of violence since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=54.88s)]
*  effect in January. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=59.160000000000004s)]
*  But recently, talks on how to extend that ceasefire have stalled. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=61.08s)]
*  What we don't think has happened yet is any sign of a ground operation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=65.4s)]
*  We think these are all airstrikes so far. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=72.76s)]
*  That could change very quickly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=77.2s)]
*  Israel had planned for weeks for renewed ground operations, renewed invasion of places that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=79.64s)]
*  they had left during earlier phases of the war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=85.52s)]
*  But we don't see that just yet. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  And that has caused analysts to wonder whether this is still a short-term effort to force [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Hamas to compromise during ongoing negotiations, or whether it is in fact the opening salvos [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=101.32s)]
*  of a much more intense full-scale war in which Israel, once and for all, will attempt to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=109.72s)]
*  force Hamas from power. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=116.0s)]
*  It's not clear where on the spectrum between those two things we are yet. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=118.52s)]
*  Live coverage of the strikes and the fallout is at nytimes.com. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  In Washington, the showdown between the Trump administration and the courts escalated yesterday [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=132.0s)]
*  over recent deportations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=140.28s)]
*  A federal judge questioned a lawyer for the government about what time exactly the U.S. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=142.56s)]
*  deported hundreds of Venezuelan migrants this weekend. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=147.84s)]
*  He wanted to know the timeline to see if the Trump administration had defied his order to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  stop the flights and even turn them around midair if necessary. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=156.2s)]
*  The Justice Department lawyer repeatedly stonewalled the judge and refused to answer his questions, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=160.96s)]
*  citing national security. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=166.24s)]
*  A Times review of flight data, though, does provide a timeline. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=168.28s)]
*  The data shows that two of the planes were mid-flight and one had not taken off yet when [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=172.16s)]
*  the judge's order was posted, apparently putting the administration in violation of the ruling. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=176.8s)]
*  The tense back and forth between the judge and the government lawyer was the latest and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=182.68s)]
*  potentially most serious flashpoint yet between the White House and the judicial branch, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=187.06s)]
*  as many of the president's actions face legal challenges. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=192.58s)]
*  If the executive branch does not comply with judicial rulings, it could push the country [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=196.58s)]
*  towards a constitutional crisis. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=201.66s)]
*  You're going against the judges now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  What's next? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=206.78s)]
*  Another flight. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=208.7s)]
*  Another flight every day. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=209.7s)]
*  In an interview on Fox News yesterday, President Trump's border czar Tom Homan promised the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=210.7s)]
*  deportations will continue. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=215.94s)]
*  I'm proud to be a part of this administration. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=218.22s)]
*  We're not stopping. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=220.26s)]
*  I don't care what the judges think. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=221.26s)]
*  I don't care what the left thinks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  We're coming. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=224.06s)]
*  Here are three more updates on the Trump administration. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=225.06s)]
*  President Trump is set to speak today with Russian President Vladimir Putin about how [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=234.7s)]
*  When asked what they would discuss, Trump said it would include, quote, dividing up [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=236.9s)]
*  certain assets, which echoes earlier comments from U.S. officials that Ukraine will have [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=241.3s)]
*  to give up some of its land as part of any peace deal. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  Also, President Trump said he's pulling secret service protection for Joe Biden's adult [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=250.74s)]
*  children, Hunter and Ashley Biden. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=256.06s)]
*  Since taking office, Trump has revoked secret service protection from a number of people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=259.26s)]
*  he perceives as his adversaries, including members of his first administration, Mike [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=264.18s)]
*  Pompeo and John Bolton, who have faced ongoing death threats. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=269.34000000000003s)]
*  And... [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=273.14s)]
*  You've got a lot of reading. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=274.14s)]
*  I don't believe we're going to redact anything. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=276.06s)]
*  I said, just don't redact. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=277.86s)]
*  You can't redact. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=279.1s)]
*  President Trump says his administration will release 80,000 pages of documents today related [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=280.66s)]
*  to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=285.98s)]
*  But he didn't say what's in them. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=288.94s)]
*  The assassination has long fueled conspiracy theories, including some that Trump himself [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=290.90000000000003s)]
*  has shared. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  In Texas, authorities have arrested and charged two people with violating the state's near-total [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=300.3s)]
*  abortion ban, a midwife and her colleague. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=306.3s)]
*  These appear to be the first criminal arrests of alleged abortion providers in the U.S. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=309.66s)]
*  since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  In a statement, the attorney general of Texas said that the midwife operated a network of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=318.5s)]
*  clinics in the Houston area. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  She was also charged with practicing medicine without a license. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=324.98s)]
*  According to a friend of the midwife, she had been on her way to one of her clinics [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=328.74s)]
*  when she was pulled over by police at gunpoint and taken into custody. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=332.1s)]
*  Until now, states with abortion bans have largely only threatened prosecution rather [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=337.26s)]
*  than carry out actual arrests. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=342.1s)]
*  And finally, the main climbing season on Mount Everest starts next month, and expedition [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=350.78000000000003s)]
*  companies there will be trying out some new tech. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=356.54s)]
*  They're going to be testing drones to carry some of the load. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=359.54s)]
*  Right now, Nepali Sherpas carry the heavy equipment for many of the climbers who try [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=363.5s)]
*  to make their way up the world's tallest mountain. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=368.1s)]
*  The Sherpas also carry ladders to put over crevices and stash oxygen bottles at high [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=371.1s)]
*  camps. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=376.18s)]
*  They can make the climb at least 40 times a season with all of that in tow. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=377.46s)]
*  Now the drones will be used to ferry some of it instead and to cut down on transport [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=382.14s)]
*  time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=386.46s)]
*  Goods that would normally take about seven hours to carry on foot can be airlifted in [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=387.46s)]
*  about 15 minutes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=391.7s)]
*  By relying less on Sherpas and reducing their number of trips, expedition companies hope [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=393.66s)]
*  that the chance of fatal accidents will go down. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=398.82s)]
*  There have been multiple deadly tragedies involving Sherpas, including an avalanche [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=402.22s)]
*  a few years ago that killed three of the guides. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=406.38s)]
*  The plan is also to use the drones to pick up some of the trash that climbers leave behind. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=409.62s)]
*  Some years, volunteers have collected more than 20,000 pounds of trash off of the mountain. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=415.26s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily, how President Trump is targeting a single [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=426.02s)]
*  law firm as part of a revenge campaign against his political enemies. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=430.7s)]
*  What's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=436.02s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=440.5s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvCbKtgDAtI&t=441.5s)]
