# What Trump Did on Day 1, and Biden’s Final Acts
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=4.76s)]
*  Today is Tuesday, January 21st. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=5.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=7.76s)]
*  Please raise your right hand and repeat after me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=18.32s)]
*  In Washington, D.C., yesterday, Donald Trump was sworn into office, returning to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=24.34s)]
*  power as the 47th president of the United States. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=29.88s)]
*  So help me God. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=33.04s)]
*  So help me God. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=34.04s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=35.04s)]
*  Mr. Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=36.04s)]
*  Within hours, Trump got to work, moving to a nearby arena where a crowd watched him sign [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  the first of a barrage of executive orders that will transform the federal government [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=44.0s)]
*  and reshape some of the biggest policy issues in American life. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=49.28s)]
*  So, revoking nearly 80 destructive, radical executive actions of the previous administration, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=53.68s)]
*  they'll all be null and void. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=60.6s)]
*  Within about, what, five minutes? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=62.56s)]
*  Is that them over there? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=64.36s)]
*  Five minutes? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=65.72s)]
*  The president sat at a desk placed on a red carpet on the arena floor and signed order [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=66.72s)]
*  after order as an aide handed them to him under the jumbotron. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=71.16s)]
*  The next item, sir, is a freeze on all federal hiring, accepting the military and... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=75.12s)]
*  Trump took aim at the government itself, moving to strip some federal employees of their job [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=81.0s)]
*  protections and ending diversity and inclusion programs. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=85.72s)]
*  He also gutted protections for transgender Americans, withdrew the U.S. from the World [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=89.72s)]
*  Health Organization, and rolled back a long list of efforts to fight climate change. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=94.72s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=100.6s)]
*  The next item here is the withdrawal from the Paris climate treaty. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=101.6s)]
*  It's the kind of quintessential Trump moment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=106.04s)]
*  You have this combination of somebody who has been in reality TV and also somebody that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  is now leading the free world. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=121.0s)]
*  Zolan Kano-Youngs is a Times White House correspondent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=122.92s)]
*  He says that among Trump's most significant moves yesterday were his efforts to start [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=126.16s)]
*  fundamentally changing America's immigration system. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=130.88s)]
*  Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border and ordered the military to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=135.16s)]
*  play a direct role in immigration enforcement. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=139.44s)]
*  He suspended refugee resettlement to the U.S. and he moved to end automatic citizenship [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=142.52s)]
*  for children born to undocumented immigrants, even though birthright citizenship is protected [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=148.0s)]
*  by the Constitution. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=152.6s)]
*  A lot of these executive orders are, I would say, an attempt to turn campaign promises [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=154.16s)]
*  that had been sort of the centerpiece of his political identity into tangible policy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=160.52s)]
*  And make no mistake, he's testing the law with these executive orders as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=167.44s)]
*  You know, the implementation of these orders are going to be something to watch here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=172.44s)]
*  Just how much they run into lawsuits, they run into the courts, and we have to see how [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=177.0s)]
*  effective the new Trump administration is at implementing some of these policies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=182.52s)]
*  You know, an announcement is one thing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=187.52s)]
*  And it can certainly galvanize a base, particularly when they're packed into a basketball arena [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=189.28s)]
*  when you're signing these orders. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=194.92s)]
*  Implementing them so that it actually makes good on commitments that you stated during [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=197.32s)]
*  the campaign is another thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=201.52s)]
*  Later on Monday... [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=207.68s)]
*  What they've done to these people is outrageous. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  There's rarely been anything like it in history, in the history of our country. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=213.24s)]
*  President Trump issued sweeping pardons to nearly all 1,600 people charged in connection [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=217.44s)]
*  with January 6. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=222.72s)]
*  The pardons covered those charged with nonviolent offenses and people convicted of assaulting [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=224.68s)]
*  police officers. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=229.56s)]
*  In D.C., a crowd immediately gathered outside of a jail to cheer on some who were released. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  We are so grateful to President Trump. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=240.16s)]
*  Promises made, promises kept. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=242.76s)]
*  Trump had signaled for months that he would issue the pardons. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=245.4s)]
*  Some people had hired cars in advance to meet them at their prisons. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=248.24s)]
*  Others, who'd already served their sentences, were following along from so-called pardon [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  watch parties. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=256.2s)]
*  A former federal prosecutor who supervised many of the riot cases told The Times, quote, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=257.48s)]
*  "...these pardons suggest that if you commit acts of violence, as long as you do so on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=263.92s)]
*  behalf of a politically powerful person, you may be able to escape consequences." [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=268.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, Joe Biden also issued pardons yesterday in an effort to shield his family [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=275.36s)]
*  and those who worked closely with him from Trump's promised retribution. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=283.2s)]
*  In his final moments in office, Biden granted preemptive pardons to five family members, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=287.76s)]
*  including his brothers, trying to head off potential investigations into what Trump has [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  called the Biden crime family. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=296.6s)]
*  He also pardoned others who have been high-profile targets for Trump, including Dr. Anthony Fauci [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=299.32s)]
*  and the lawmakers on the House committee that investigated January 6th. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=304.72s)]
*  Some thanked Biden for the pardon, saying it was a relief, while others had said they [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=308.92s)]
*  didn't want them, arguing it gives the impression that they had committed a crime. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  After the inauguration... [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=318.04s)]
*  It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=321.04s)]
*  And I tell you what, the greater honor of being able to serve with all of you. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=326.04s)]
*  You're incredible. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=333.04s)]
*  Biden spoke to his staff, who gathered to say goodbye at Joint Base Andrews. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=334.48s)]
*  The former president ordered a plane to California for vacation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=339.52000000000004s)]
*  Then he's expected to return home to Delaware. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=343.72s)]
*  The CEOs of some of America's biggest companies are making an aggressive push to get employees [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=354.0s)]
*  back in the office five days a week. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=360.24s)]
*  Amazon and AT&T implemented return to office policies this month, and JP Morgan will require [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=363.68s)]
*  its workforce to be fully in person starting in March. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  It's part of a major shift away from hybrid and remote work flexibility, which came in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  during the pandemic and stuck around as what many workers considered a perk and a boon [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=377.88s)]
*  for work-life balance. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=382.68s)]
*  Now economists say that a tighter labor market has empowered companies to roll it back. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  That could push some workers to quit. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=390.38s)]
*  And in some cases, that seems to be the goal. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=392.78s)]
*  Companies have put the policies in place knowing some workers may leave. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=395.94s)]
*  It essentially lets them cut their headcount without having to do layoffs. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=399.7s)]
*  It's not just happening in the private sector. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=404.14s)]
*  One of the executive orders Trump signed yesterday requires all federal employees to return to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=406.9s)]
*  the office five days a week, too. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=411.46s)]
*  That may help him follow through on his promise to shrink the U.S. government. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=414.02s)]
*  And finally, I mean, look at that thing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=420.38s)]
*  It's looking rough. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=427.98s)]
*  The medals from last year's Olympic Games in Paris seem to be falling apart. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  Starting to chip off a little. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=434.86s)]
*  Athletes who swam, sprinted and back flipped their way to victory have been sharing pictures [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=437.9s)]
*  of their medals looking rusty, tarnished, even chipped. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=442.3s)]
*  More than 100 athletes have already asked for theirs to be replaced. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=446.26s)]
*  The International Olympic Committee has apologized. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=449.86s)]
*  And the French Mint, which made the 2024 medals, has stepped up to take the blame, saying there [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=452.74s)]
*  was a technical problem with the varnish. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=457.98s)]
*  But it's put a harsh spotlight on the company that designed the medals. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=460.78000000000003s)]
*  LVMH, the luxury goods empire behind Louis Vuitton and other high-end brands. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=464.86s)]
*  The medals were supposed to be a representation of fine craftsmanship. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  Not, as one swimmer put it, flaky metal crocodile skin. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=482.53999999999996s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Times reporters Peter Baker and Jonathan Swan explain what Trump's [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=483.85999999999996s)]
*  first day in office says about his second term as president. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=489.26s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uduOyddENvs&t=498.78s)]
