# A Manhunt in Manhattan, and Another Trump Pick in Trouble
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Amelia Nirenberg. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Thursday, December 5th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=8.4s)]
*  The full investigative efforts of the New York City Police Department are well underway [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  and we will not rest until we identify and apprehend the shooter in this case. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=19.0s)]
*  In New York City, an intensive manhunt is underway after the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=24.62s)]
*  one of the country's largest companies, was assassinated in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=29.88s)]
*  Every indication is that this was a premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=34.08s)]
*  At a press conference, the city's police commissioner said that the CEO, Brian Thompson, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  was attacked as he was heading into a hotel for a conference early yesterday morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=45.96s)]
*  A gunman wearing a mask, who'd been waiting for Thompson, came up from behind and shot [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=50.32s)]
*  him multiple times. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=54.8s)]
*  The suspect fled, first on foot, then on an e-bike, and was last seen in Central Park. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=56.4s)]
*  The police are using dogs, drones, and surveillance video to track down the suspect. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=62.98s)]
*  They are also analyzing a cell phone they found near the site of the shooting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=67.92s)]
*  And they're scraping data about the public e-bike he apparently used, since riders need [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=71.72s)]
*  a credit card or debit card to unlock the bikes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=76.72s)]
*  It's not clear what motivated the shooting. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=81.32s)]
*  Thompson had recently received several threats, but investigators aren't sure where they [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=83.76s)]
*  came from or exactly what they said. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=87.4s)]
*  His killing sent shockwaves through the insurance industry. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=90.12s)]
*  UnitedHealthcare is one of the nation's biggest insurers, with about 140,000 employees and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  over $370 billion in revenue. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  It is the classic art of the smear. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=100.68s)]
*  Take whatever tiny kernels of truth, and there are tiny, tiny ones in there, and blow them [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  up into a masquerade of a narrative about somebody that I am definitely not. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=120.84s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, has launched a public campaign [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=126.48s)]
*  to try and keep his nomination on track. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=130.96s)]
*  In a radio interview and newspaper essay, he pushed back on a swirl of accusations of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=133.46s)]
*  rape, sexual assault, and drunken behavior. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=138.08s)]
*  The revelations have sparked serious concerns, even among Republican lawmakers who are loyal [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  to Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=145.84s)]
*  And Hegseth has been meeting one-on-one with senators who will vote on his nomination to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=146.88s)]
*  convince them that he should still be confirmed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=151.12s)]
*  The word I would use to describe Pete Hegseth's viability right now is troubled. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=153.76s)]
*  Jonathan Swan is a Times Political reporter. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=162.6s)]
*  Most people I talk to who are close to President-elect Trump would rate Hegseth's chances less than [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=165.6s)]
*  50% that he makes it through. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  He hates surprises from his candidates. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=177.12s)]
*  He doesn't like feeling like people haven't been forthcoming with him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=179.92s)]
*  He complained to people privately that Hegseth hadn't told him about these things. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=184.68s)]
*  And over the last 24 hours, even as Donald Trump has insisted to Hegseth himself that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=189.24s)]
*  he's got his back, Trump has been very seriously entertaining the idea of replacing Hegseth [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=195.96s)]
*  with somebody else. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=204.0s)]
*  And one person that has caught his attention in particular is Ron DeSantis, the governor [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=206.2s)]
*  of Florida. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=211.68s)]
*  That might be very surprising to people given how ugly the primary campaign between Trump [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=213.16s)]
*  and DeSantis was, but Trump has told sources of ours that he thinks it would be a quote-unquote [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=218.76s)]
*  big story if he resurrected DeSantis after defeating him and put him in as the secretary [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=224.12s)]
*  of defense. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=230.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Times has learned that Donald Trump's family business is poised to capitalize [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=237.32s)]
*  on his presidency. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  And to do that, it's loosening its own ethics rules. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  During his first term, the Trump Organization avoided deals in foreign countries. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=245.72s)]
*  This time, they're not making that promise. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  Without the guardrail, the company could profit from business in countries essential to American [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=253.0s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=257.24s)]
*  Trump's son Eric, the company's de facto leader, has already been forging ahead. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=258.88s)]
*  In the past few months, he's made real estate deals in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, and the United [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=263.52s)]
*  Arab Emirates. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=268.32s)]
*  He's also considering new hotel projects in the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=269.48s)]
*  There will still be some ethics guidelines. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=274.32s)]
*  For example, the Trump Organization is not expected to make deals directly with foreign [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=276.32s)]
*  governments. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=280.4s)]
*  Still, the new ventures could blur the lines between the Trump Organization and the Trump [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=281.4s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=285.84s)]
*  One ethics expert told the Times, quote, I fear that Americans will look at public office [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=287.32s)]
*  as a job that is no longer about public service. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=291.76s)]
*  It is a family business. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=294.08s)]
*  And in other news, the fallout from the short-lived declaration of martial law by South Korea's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=299.76s)]
*  president continues. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=304.64s)]
*  The country's defense minister has now stepped down. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=306.96s)]
*  And today, in the first inside account of the chaotic night, military officials testified [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=310.0s)]
*  that President Yun Suk-yul's decision caught them completely by surprise. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=314.8s)]
*  The general who was appointed to oversee martial law said he only learned of the move when [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=319.4s)]
*  Yun announced it on television. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=323.64s)]
*  Massive protests against the president are continuing across the country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=326.12s)]
*  They're expected to grow even larger on Saturday, when lawmakers will vote on whether [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=330.4s)]
*  or not to impeach him. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=334.44s)]
*  And, the U.S. Supreme Court appears likely to uphold a ban on transgender care for minors [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=336.24s)]
*  in Tennessee. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=342.48s)]
*  After hearing arguments in the case yesterday, the court's conservative majority seems inclined [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=344.16s)]
*  to let individual states decide how to handle the treatments, much like it made abortion [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=348.2s)]
*  a state-by-state issue when it overturned Roe v. Wade. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=353.08s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Time Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak breaks down the case and the potential [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=356.96s)]
*  implications of the court's ruling, which will come next year. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=361.84s)]
*  And finally, a new tool from DeepMind, a Google company, could revolutionize weather forecasting [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=368.12s)]
*  using AI. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  The company says the tool, called Gencast, can generate 15-day forecasts faster and more [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=375.08s)]
*  accurately than any other model. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=380.24s)]
*  According to results published in the journal Nature this week, Gencast outperformed the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=382.8s)]
*  current gold standard in weather forecasting 97% of the time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=386.92s)]
*  It does have some limitations. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=391.48s)]
*  For example, Gencast doesn't provide much detail about the intensity of a hurricane, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=393.0s)]
*  even though it is better at predicting its path. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=397.76000000000005s)]
*  But the company is hoping that outside researchers can help test and improve Gencast, and it's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  planning to make the tool, and the computer code that powers it, available to the public. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=405.24s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=412.92s)]
*  I'm Amelia Nierenberg. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=414.12s)]
*  Tracy Mumford will be back tomorrow. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLps82dRNYo&t=415.48s)]
