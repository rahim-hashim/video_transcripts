# Biden’s Cancer Diagnosis, Extreme Weather in Central U.S., How AI is Used in Schools | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, May 19th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=8.22s)]
*  with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, according to his office. In a statement released [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  yesterday, the office said that on a scale measuring how aggressive prostate cancers [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=22.0s)]
*  are, Biden's is a nine out of 10. The cancer has also spread to his bones. Prostate cancer [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=26.52s)]
*  experts told the Times that means it cannot be cured, but there have been significant [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=32.96s)]
*  medical developments in recent years that have improved the prognosis for people with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=37.64s)]
*  Biden's condition. Experts say that in the past decade, survival rates have almost tripled. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=41.62s)]
*  One doctor told the Times that with treatment, Biden, who's 82 years old, could still live [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=47.54s)]
*  for five to 10 more years or even potentially longer. Because prostate cancer is fed by [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=52.62s)]
*  testosterone, treatment typically includes both injections and pills to eliminate the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  hormone from the body. Some men also go on to have chemotherapy or radiation. In the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=63.4s)]
*  statement, Biden's office said he and his family are reviewing treatment options with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=68.9s)]
*  his physicians. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=73.02s)]
*  This morning in Washington, President Trump is expected to have a phone call with Russian [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=82.62s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump said that after he talks [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=88.9s)]
*  to Putin, he'll also speak with Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky, and he posted [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  on social media that he hoped it would be a, quote, productive day that would lead to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=99.38000000000001s)]
*  a ceasefire. Trump came into office promising to quickly stop the fighting in Ukraine, where [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  over a million Ukrainian and Russian soldiers have been killed or injured. But so far, the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=109.58000000000001s)]
*  White House has been unable to negotiate a wide scale truce, even as there's been a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  flurry of discussions, including the first in-person talks between Ukrainian and Russian [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  diplomats that took place on Friday. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  All of this diplomatic activity is happening against a backdrop of escalating violence. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  My colleague Mark Santora is in Kyiv and has been reporting on the war since it started [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=131.8s)]
*  more than three years ago. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=135.96s)]
*  With each round of intense diplomatic activity in this war, there's been a corresponding [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=137.62s)]
*  rise in violence. Ukrainian and Western officials see a pattern where Russia tries to use the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=141.62s)]
*  violence as a means to intimidate both Ukraine and its allies at critical diplomatic moments. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=147.62s)]
*  This week, we saw the largest drone strike aimed at Ukraine of the entire war, more than [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=153.6s)]
*  270 basically long range exploding drones packed with really powerful explosives. And [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=159.02s)]
*  then on the front line, you have stepped up assaults by the Russians ahead of what many [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=166.32s)]
*  Ukrainian and Western officials believe will be a large scale offensive effort this summer. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=171.36s)]
*  So you see this continuing trend over the last three years where last year was deadlier [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=177.52s)]
*  than the first two years combined. And then the first three months of this year are deadlier [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  than any other three month period in terms of casualties of soldiers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=188.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, a Times analysis of satellite imagery shows that Russia has been beefing up military [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=194.84s)]
*  bases along its border with Finland. The images show recently installed rows of tents, new [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=200.56s)]
*  warehouses and renovations to hangars for fighter jets. The 800 mile border is the longest [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=207.04s)]
*  line of contact between Russia and the NATO alliance. And while officials from NATO and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=213.0s)]
*  Finland say they don't see the buildup of infrastructure as an immediate threat, it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  does suggest that Russia intends to boost its military presence in the Arctic region, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=222.24s)]
*  which has become increasingly contested. Finnish defense officials told the Times they expect [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=227.28s)]
*  to see Russia significantly boost the number of troops there in the next few years, and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  that if the war in Ukraine does wind down, thousands of Russian troops from that conflict [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=237.44s)]
*  will likely be redeployed to the Finnish border. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=242.56s)]
*  Now, three quick updates from around the U.S. this weekend. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=252.24s)]
*  The eyes have it, the motions agree to, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is ordered. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=258.52s)]
*  Late last night in Washington, D.C., the group of hardline House Republicans who had been [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=263.04s)]
*  holding up the budget mega bill that's key to President Trump's agenda agreed to let [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=268.0s)]
*  it move out of committee, despite their ongoing critique that it doesn't do enough to rein [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=273.22s)]
*  in the country's growing deficit. But the legislation's path to getting passed in the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=277.74s)]
*  full House still looks rocky. The GOP holdouts have indicated they'll continue to push for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=282.22s)]
*  more reductions in health and environmental programs, which could potentially sink it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=287.34000000000003s)]
*  altogether. Also in the Midwest and mid Atlantic, the roof fell off the whole building and the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=291.86s)]
*  walls came crashing in here. It's bad. We need help. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=300.38s)]
*  A series of deadly storms and tornadoes killed at least 28 people and injured dozens more. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=306.42s)]
*  Most of those killed were in Kentucky and Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis called it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=313.1s)]
*  one of the worst storms in the city's history, estimating that 5000 buildings there were [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=316.98s)]
*  damaged. The storms came as the National Weather Service has been struggling to keep some of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=321.74s)]
*  its offices staffed. The union that represents federal meteorologists said the weather office [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=326.62s)]
*  in eastern Kentucky no longer has a permanent overnight forecaster and had to scramble on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=331.82s)]
*  Friday. It's one of several offices that's lost staff in the wake of cuts ordered by [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=337.02s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency. One union official said, quote, For most of the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=341.94s)]
*  last half century, NWS has been a 24 7 operation. Not anymore. And in Palm Springs. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=346.74s)]
*  What I can say is this is probably the largest bombing scene that we've had in Southern [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=356.1s)]
*  California. Investigators say a bombing attack on a fertility clinic this Saturday was carried [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=360.46s)]
*  out by a 25 year old man who died in the blast. Authorities called the attack, which injured [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=365.62s)]
*  four others, an act of terrorism, saying the suspect had, quote, nihilistic ideations. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=371.34s)]
*  They're investigating a link between the bombing and an obscure movement that discourages the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=377.78s)]
*  creation of new life and promotes death. Ahead of the bombing, audio was posted to a website [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=382.02s)]
*  related to the movement featuring a man who said he was going to bomb an in vitro fertilization [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=387.66s)]
*  clinic because he was angry at his own existence. Sources tell the Times investigators are trying [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=392.3s)]
*  to verify whether the recording was made by the bomber. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=397.62s)]
*  And finally, across the country, schools are wrestling with how to handle the rise of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=409.02000000000004s)]
*  artificial intelligence. There's been concerns about cheating, about chat bots spewing false [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=413.66s)]
*  information, even about teachers letting chat bots write their syllabus. Many districts [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=418.9s)]
*  have responded by banning the technology. But Times reporter Natasha Singer recently [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=424.38s)]
*  went to Florida to see what it looks like when a district goes all in on AI instead. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=429.14s)]
*  Miami Dade County Public Schools, the third largest US school district, is in the middle [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=434.54s)]
*  of this staggering effort to roll out AI chat bots for all teachers and also for more [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=439.9s)]
*  than 100,000 high school students. Natasha says that while Miami Dade did initially restrict [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=445.73999999999995s)]
*  the technology, it then made a U-turn. I went into an English class where the students [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=451.34s)]
*  were reading Oedipus Rex, the Sophocles play, and that's about free will. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=457.02s)]
*  Do you believe people have control over their own destiny? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=462.7s)]
*  And their teacher, Ms. Chirino, had asked the students to write a paragraph about free will [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=465.94s)]
*  versus fate. Take a clear position and support your claim. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=471.58s)]
*  And once they had written this paragraph, they then pasted it into the Google chat bot, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=475.82s)]
*  along with a grading rubric that the English teacher had written that basically said, you [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=481.5s)]
*  know, give students one point if they wrote a good thesis sentence and give students [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=486.7s)]
*  two points if they use really good examples to back up their claim. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=491.7s)]
*  And so the English teacher was asking students to get feedback first from a chat bot before [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=495.06s)]
*  they got feedback from her. And then they handed them into her. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=501.18s)]
*  So it's not like she is delegating the actual final grading to a bot. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=504.34s)]
*  But it was an interim thing that could be done quickly in class and help some students [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=509.98s)]
*  sharpen their writing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=514.42s)]
*  I think we're really at a critical moment with these new artificial intelligence tools [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=517.4200000000001s)]
*  in schools, and there's a lot of hope that they could be very, very helpful. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=523.5s)]
*  On the other hand, Daniel Matteo, the assistant superintendent of Miami Dade Schools, who [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=528.22s)]
*  is in charge of this AI rollout, said to me, like, we are looking at AI as if it is not [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=533.86s)]
*  some kind of magical, transformative, world-changing platform. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=539.7s)]
*  We're treating it like just another tool in the arsenal of education. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=543.98s)]
*  We have to have guardrails in place. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=547.5799999999999s)]
*  We have to vet it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=549.26s)]
*  But we also have to show teachers and students how to use these tools that are going to be [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=550.38s)]
*  part of their lives. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=555.62s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily, how Donald Trump and his MAGA movement took [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=561.06s)]
*  up the cause of white farmers in South Africa. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=566.26s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=569.5799999999999s)]
*  podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=572.78s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imlt86aIgP8&t=575.18s)]
