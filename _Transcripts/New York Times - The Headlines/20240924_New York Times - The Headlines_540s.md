# Israeli Strikes Kill Hundreds in Lebanon, and Biden to Address U.N.
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=4.84s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, September 24th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=8.64s)]
*  Israel and Hezbollah are trading fire this morning, one day after an intense series of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=14.56s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes left Lebanon reeling. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=18.98s)]
*  Yesterday, hundreds of people in Lebanon were killed and over 1,500 were injured, according [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=22.0s)]
*  to the country's health ministry, making it the deadliest day of Israeli attacks there [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=27.26s)]
*  in nearly two decades. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=31.5s)]
*  Officials said dozens of women and children were among the dead. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force said it hit about 1,600 Hezbollah targets as part of an ongoing effort [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=37.1s)]
*  to weaken the Iran-backed group that's been firing on Israel for months in solidarity [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=42.7s)]
*  with Hamas. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=47.18000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah launched more than 150 rockets and other weapons of its own into northern Israel [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=48.82s)]
*  yesterday, sending people scrambling for shelter. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=53.5s)]
*  News correspondent Christina Goldbaum has been reporting on the escalating conflict [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=57.06s)]
*  from Lebanon's capital. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=61.02s)]
*  I'm in Beirut right now, where over the past few days, people have become increasingly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=62.74s)]
*  on edge, as this once kind of distant prospect of the country spiraling into an all-out war [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=68.0s)]
*  with Israel has felt more and more like a real possibility. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=73.92s)]
*  Since Monday, schools have closed because administrators were worried about airstrikes [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=78.94s)]
*  hitting the city. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=83.14s)]
*  School stations have become absolutely packed as some people fill up their tanks and head [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=84.6s)]
*  to the mountains in the north that they think are relatively safer, in case there are many [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  airstrikes in the city. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  On Monday, I spoke to one woman, Lama Ejul Sattar, who had brought her 10-year-old daughter [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  to work with her in a mall in Beirut that's just outside of a neighborhood called Dahiya [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  that's largely controlled by Hezbollah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  And she told me that she came to work that day with both her and her daughter's passports, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=110.92s)]
*  just in case they suddenly had to evacuate the city. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=115.88s)]
*  And as we spoke, she told me almost in a whisper so that her daughter wouldn't hear, you know, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=118.88s)]
*  death is very close, very worried it's near. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=123.8s)]
*  And she said that any decision I make might not be the right decision. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=127.0s)]
*  I'm not sure about anything. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=131.2s)]
*  Which is to say that that uncertainty in the city of what will come next is still hanging [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=133.44s)]
*  very heavy over folks who are trying to make these impossible decisions about what to do. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=138.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, the United Nations General Assembly kicks off today, bringing world leaders, including [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=150.0s)]
*  President Biden and the leaders of Israel, Lebanon, Iran, and Ukraine to New York City. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=155.2s)]
*  International challenges are moving faster than our ability to solve them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=162.04s)]
*  We see out of control geopolitical divisions and runaway conflicts, not least in Ukraine, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=167.54s)]
*  Gaza, Sudan and beyond. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  In remarks ahead of the annual conference, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=175.62s)]
*  described the global chaos that's the backdrop to the meeting. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=180.34s)]
*  Normally, as part of the General Assembly, the UN Security Council holds one session [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=184.26s)]
*  on the sidelines. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=188.98s)]
*  This year, they're scheduled to hold three, one on Ukraine, one on Gaza, and a broader [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=190.54s)]
*  meeting about how the UN can resolve international crises at all. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=195.34s)]
*  Global institutions and frameworks are today totally inadequate to deal with these complex [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  and even existential challenges. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=206.94s)]
*  This General Assembly comes amid a really turbulent year for the UN itself. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=210.02s)]
*  It has really struggled to remain relevant in mediating conflicts and in trying to play [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=215.46s)]
*  a political role. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=222.18s)]
*  UNS reporter Farnaz Fasihi has covered the UN for the past decade. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=224.02s)]
*  Every year, world leaders gather at the General Assembly and they talk about the need for [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=228.18s)]
*  cooperation and diplomacy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=232.66000000000003s)]
*  But then they leave and nothing concrete comes out of it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=235.54000000000002s)]
*  So there is also a reckoning here that both the UN as an institution and world powers [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  have not really been able to do what they're tasked to do at the UN, which is to mediate [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=245.78s)]
*  and prevent conflicts. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  Hugo Teres talks about how the UN was created in the aftermath of World War II and the world [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=251.82s)]
*  was very different 80 years ago. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=257.18s)]
*  And so part of what we're going to be also hearing this week is how to make it more adaptable [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=259.02s)]
*  to today's needs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=264.78s)]
*  This morning, President Biden is expected to address the General Assembly. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=267.46s)]
*  It will be his fourth and final speech there as president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=270.94s)]
*  And it comes as other world leaders are preparing for a new White House. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=273.78s)]
*  Many leaders are rushing to meet with Biden, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump during or after [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=277.78s)]
*  their visit to New York. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=282.52s)]
*  On Monday, I was in the federal courthouse in Florida where Ryan Routh appeared for the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=288.61999999999995s)]
*  second time in front of a judge. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=293.34s)]
*  Times reporter Patty Mazzei has been covering the investigation into the man who authorities [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=295.85999999999996s)]
*  allege was hiding with a loaded rifle near where Donald Trump was golfing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=300.26s)]
*  Just after he was arrested earlier this month, Ryan Routh was charged with unlawful possession [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=305.0s)]
*  of a firearm and having a firearm with a wiped out serial number. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=309.74s)]
*  Now federal prosecutors say they will also charge Routh with attempted assassination. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=314.24s)]
*  What was interesting in the lengthy hearing was that we started to get a look at the details [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=318.96s)]
*  of what information they have already gathered in the time since Routh was arrested, including [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=323.84s)]
*  a note that they say was written by Routh. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=329.04s)]
*  The note was in a box of items Routh had left with a friend in North Carolina several months [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=333.08s)]
*  ago. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  And in it, he wrote about his plans to carry out an assassination attempt on Trump. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  And he also mentioned several times that the attempt might fail, which his defense lawyers [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=345.62s)]
*  suggested was a sign of how unsophisticated and untrained Routh was and how perhaps he [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  intended to make more of a statement than actually succeed in this assassination attempt. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=358.04s)]
*  But prosecutors pointed to the note as evidence that Routh had been planning an assassination [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=364.6s)]
*  attempt for a long time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  Yesterday the FBI released its annual report on crime in the United States, and it shows [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=378.52000000000004s)]
*  a significant drop in violent crime across the country. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=383.16s)]
*  Notably, there was a remarkable 11.6% decline in the number of homicides last year compared [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=386.92s)]
*  to the year before. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  It's the largest year-to-year drop in homicides since the FBI started keeping national crime [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=394.2s)]
*  data in 1960. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=399.0s)]
*  Overall, from 2022 to 2023, violent crime fell 3%, and the number of other nonviolent [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=400.56s)]
*  crimes also fell. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=407.36s)]
*  Burglaries were down about 8%, and larceny, theft of personal property, was down about [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=409.0s)]
*  4%. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=413.92s)]
*  The one exception was car thefts, which rose more than 12%. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=415.08s)]
*  Still, despite what the data shows, a Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans believed [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=419.08s)]
*  crime was rising last year, even as it was falling. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=424.4s)]
*  Criminology experts tell the Times that people's perceptions of crime are often driven less [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=428.68s)]
*  by numbers and more by what they hear and feel in their communities, on TV, and in their [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=432.79999999999995s)]
*  social media feeds. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=438.28s)]
*  And finally, they're controversial, they're influential, and if you're applying to any [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=446.08s)]
*  kind of college in the U.S., they're probably also inescapable. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=451.24s)]
*  Today, U.S. News and World Report published its latest rankings of American colleges and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=455.08s)]
*  universities. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  For decades, the list has been a guide for students and parents, and a source of pride [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  and or jealousy for schools. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=466.44s)]
*  It's also faced intense criticism. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=468.88s)]
*  The Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, called it a, quote, false altar and said it [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=470.92s)]
*  has created an obsession with selectivity in higher ed. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=475.76s)]
*  In recent years, prominent schools like Yale and Harvard pulled out of the rankings, saying [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=479.92s)]
*  they've skewed educational priorities, and U.S. News has been pressured to adjust its [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  calculations to take into account things like retention and graduation rates. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=489.24s)]
*  Still, the publisher makes millions of dollars a year from schools who pay to be able to [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  license the famous U.S. News badge and brag about their ranking, and many schools feel [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=497.94s)]
*  like they have to participate to catch students' attention. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=503.14s)]
*  With all that in mind, the schools at the top of this year's list for best university, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=506.68s)]
*  best liberal arts college, and best historically black institution, Princeton, Williams, and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=512.06s)]
*  Spelman. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=517.58s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=521.58s)]
*  Today on The Daily, the story behind America's housing crisis and why it's so hard to fix. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=523.22s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=529.58s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=534.0200000000001s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChrIa0GBDHY&t=535.5s)]
