# Harris Puts Trump on Defensive in Debate, and Hurricane Francine
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=5.0s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, September 11th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=8.0s)]
*  The high-stakes showdown here in Philadelphia between Vice President Kamala Harris and former [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=11.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=17.92s)]
*  Their first face-to-face meeting in this presidential election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=19.52s)]
*  Their first face-to-face meeting ever. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=22.7s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Donald Trump took the stage last night for what could be the only debate [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=25.36s)]
*  of this presidential race. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=29.92s)]
*  And Harris put Trump on the defensive. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  I have talked with military leaders, some of whom worked with you, and they say you're [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=34.52s)]
*  a disgrace. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=39.28s)]
*  Harris went after Trump over his foreign policy, his tax plan, his criminal convictions, his [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=41.14s)]
*  handling of COVID, and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  And now in over 20 states, there are Trump abortion bans. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=50.1s)]
*  In response, Trump found himself re-litigating his own record more than picking apart Harris's, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=55.2s)]
*  which his advisors had hoped he could do. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=61.56s)]
*  Trump also tried to paint Harris as dangerously liberal and a flip-flopper. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=68.88s)]
*  She's going to my philosophy now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=73.48s)]
*  In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=74.84s)]
*  But he repeatedly veered off on tangents, at one point bringing up an inflammatory debunked [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=77.16s)]
*  claim that immigrants in Ohio are eating people's pets. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=81.76s)]
*  The two candidates were really a study in contrasts. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  Harris often stood smiling and looked directly at Trump while he glowered into the camera [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=89.28s)]
*  and shouted back. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  I ask, what about all the people that are pouring into our country and killing people [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  that she allowed to pour in? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  She was the Bordesar. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=100.56s)]
*  Remember that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=101.56s)]
*  She was the Bordesar. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=102.56s)]
*  She doesn't want to be called the Bordesar because she's embarrassed by the Bordesar. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=103.92000000000002s)]
*  In one notable moment, Harris brought up a topic that Trump often talks about, the crowds [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=106.2s)]
*  at his rallies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=111.24s)]
*  You will see during the course of his rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  Lecter. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=116.84s)]
*  He will talk about windmills cause cancer. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=118.0s)]
*  And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=121.28s)]
*  and boredom. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=126.16s)]
*  And I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=131.48s)]
*  On Harris's part, her crowd comment was bait. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=134.12s)]
*  And Trump took it, responding not to refute that he doesn't care about people's needs, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=136.92s)]
*  but to defend the size of his rallies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  She can't talk about that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=144.2s)]
*  People don't leave my rallies. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  That's because people want to take their country back. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=150.48s)]
*  Harris went into the debate really trying to get under Trump's skin and provoke his [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=153.64s)]
*  anger and his impulsivity in front of a microphone. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=159.8s)]
*  And she succeeded repeatedly. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=164.12s)]
*  Times politics reporter Michael Bender was covering the debate. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=167.16s)]
*  From Trump's point of view, this was his opportunity to paint her into a corner on the economy, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=170.16s)]
*  on issues like prices, blaming her for any and every unpopular policy in the current [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=176.68s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=182.96s)]
*  But he really failed to execute that at numerous points. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  And instead, Trump was on his heels for much of the night. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  Trump did many of the things that his campaign advisors specifically wanted to avoid, like [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  yelling into the microphone and clinging to falsehoods over the 2020 elections. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  And in the end, that's probably a net win for Harris. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Minutes after the candidates stepped off the stage, Harris locked in just about the biggest [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=213.56s)]
*  endorsement you can get these days, Taylor Swift. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=217.64s)]
*  In an Instagram post to her more than 280 million followers, Swift wrote, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=221.68s)]
*  Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=226.76s)]
*  I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=229.16s)]
*  She signed it, quote, a childless cat lady, a clap back to Trump's running mate, J.D. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=232.16s)]
*  Vance, who said years ago on Fox News that Democrats were childless cat ladies who are [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=236.68s)]
*  miserable at their own lives. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=241.68s)]
*  The line has come back with a vengeance as a Democratic meme. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=243.92s)]
*  Swift also called out the social media posts Trump shared last month that used artificial [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=247.92s)]
*  intelligence to suggest Swift had endorsed him. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=252.2s)]
*  She said that amped up her fears about AI and misinformation, making her feel like she [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  needed to be clear about who she's supporting. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=259.86s)]
*  Swift, who backed Biden in 2020, has a significant reach. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=263.52s)]
*  The last time she posted on Instagram encouraging people to register to vote, vote.org saw a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=267.44s)]
*  big jump in signups. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=272.56s)]
*  This morning, Harris and Trump will both be in New York City for a ceremony marking the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=276.36s)]
*  anniversary of September 11th. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=280.88s)]
*  Politics will take a backseat momentarily as the candidates and President Biden all [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  gather at the World Trade Center site to honor the more than 2,700 people who died there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=287.76s)]
*  Last night, voters in Delaware put Sarah McBride on the path to becoming the first openly [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=303.48s)]
*  transgender member of Congress. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=309.24s)]
*  McBride, a Democrat who's currently a state legislator, easily won Tuesday's primary [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=311.44s)]
*  in the deep blue state and is expected to win again in November. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=316.98s)]
*  Her victory comes as trans rights have become a political flashpoint in the country. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  McBride said she hopes that if elected to Congress, her presence there could change [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=325.88s)]
*  the rhetoric on Capitol Hill around LGBTQ issues. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=330.38s)]
*  But she also said in a phone interview with the Times that she thinks voters care more [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  about what she's done in office on issues like family leave and Medicaid than about [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=338.46s)]
*  gender identity. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=342.9s)]
*  Hurricane Francine is churning through the Gulf of Mexico this morning and expected [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=360.34s)]
*  to make landfall later today along the Louisiana coast. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=378.41999999999996s)]
*  The storm strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane last night with wind speeds of about 90 miles [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=382.55999999999995s)]
*  per hour. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=387.78s)]
*  Forecasters say Francine will come ashore this afternoon or evening west of New Orleans. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=390.14000000000004s)]
*  Some areas could get nearly a foot of rain, and storm surge combined with a high tide [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=394.94s)]
*  could lead to floodwaters of 10 feet or more. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=399.86s)]
*  As the storm approaches, local officials have been clearing storm drains and distributing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  sandbags, and residents have been rushing to stock up on water, ice, and groceries. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=407.22s)]
*  At one store in Youngsville, Louisiana, novelty cakes have been selling fast, decorated with [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=412.42s)]
*  phrases like, I will not eat all my hurricane snacks. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=417.06s)]
*  And finally, almost half of Americans say they use coffee machines with those little [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=427.42s)]
*  capsules, you know, the ones you pop in there with a satisfying kachunk. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=432.2s)]
*  And for years, Keurig, the maker of the popular K-Cup coffee pods, has claimed that those [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=435.98s)]
*  pods can be effectively recycled. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=441.5s)]
*  But yesterday, the federal government basically said, no, not really. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=444.06s)]
*  The Securities and Exchange Commission fined the company $1.5 million for inaccurate claims [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  about how easy it is to recycle the capsules. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=454.26s)]
*  The plastic they're made from can be processed by some, but not all, recycling facilities. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=457.42s)]
*  And the SEC said Keurig had failed to disclose that two of the country's largest recycling [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  companies said they don't accept the pods. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=467.86s)]
*  Keurig agreed to pay the fine and has neither admitted or denied the SEC's findings. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=470.98s)]
*  The penalty is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to crack down on [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=476.42s)]
*  bogus recycling claims. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=481.26s)]
*  Currently, there's a fight to mandate that products with those little recycle arrows on [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=483.42s)]
*  them actually need to be easily recyclable. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=487.22s)]
*  In most places, companies can put that symbol on anything, even if it's nearly guaranteed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=490.46s)]
*  to end up in the trash. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=495.34000000000003s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=501.06s)]
*  Today on The Daily, more analysis on last night's debate with Times politics reporter [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBRFywNB9s&t=503.42s)]
