# New Pushback to Trump’s Deportations, and Climate Research Under Threat
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Amelia Nirenberg in for Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=0.0s)]
*  Today is Thursday, April 17th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=7.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is facing new pressure in the courts and from members of Congress [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=15.64s)]
*  over its high profile deportations to El Salvador. Yesterday, a federal judge issued an ultimatum [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=20.32s)]
*  to the Trump administration in the case of dozens of Venezuelan men who were flown to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=26.06s)]
*  a prison there earlier this year. The judge, James Boesberg, said he would open an investigation [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  into whether the administration is in contempt of court if it doesn't let the men challenge [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=35.54s)]
*  their deportations. Boesberg had ordered officials to stop their deportation flights last month, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=40.26s)]
*  but the flights continued. The men had been detained with little to no due process after [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=45.86s)]
*  President Trump invoked a wartime powers act. The Supreme Court later struck down the judges' [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=50.7s)]
*  ruling on procedural grounds, but Boesberg said administration officials can still be [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=55.62s)]
*  held responsible if it turns out they willfully ignored his order. He said he's considering [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=59.9s)]
*  a range of options to determine who specifically disobeyed his instructions. That could include [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=64.97999999999999s)]
*  calling in officials to testify under oath. Meanwhile, in El Salvador, I'm asking President [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=70.74s)]
*  Bukele to do the right thing and allow Mr. Abrego Garcia to walk out of a prison, a man [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=77.78s)]
*  who's charged with no crime, convicted of no crime, and who was illegally abducted from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=86.7s)]
*  the United States. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, traveled to the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=91.98s)]
*  country to call attention to another controversial immigration case, the Trump administration's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=96.58s)]
*  wrongful deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. Van Hollen accused the administration [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=101.66s)]
*  of lying when it claimed Abrego Garcia, who was living in Maryland, had ties to a violent [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=107.58s)]
*  gang and called for his immediate release. This is an unsustainable and unjust moment, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=112.14s)]
*  so it cannot continue. But he said the country's vice president told him that El Salvador will [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=118.94s)]
*  not let Abrego Garcia go and that he could not visit the notorious prison where the man [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=123.7s)]
*  is being held, even though some Republican officials have been granted access. Beyond [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=128.38s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen, I'm hearing a number of Democratic members of Congress who are also [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=133.46s)]
*  considering making the trip down to El Salvador, not just to advocate for the release of Mr. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=137.1s)]
*  Abrego Garcia, but also to continue to use this as a platform to push back more broadly [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=141.78s)]
*  against President Trump's immigration reforms and the way that his administration is hoping [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=147.26s)]
*  to crack down on migrants in the United States. My colleague Robert Jimmison has been reporting [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=151.94s)]
*  from El Salvador on Van Hollen's trip. Robert says that for many Democrats, alarm bells [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  went off earlier this week when President Trump suggested he'd be open to sending even [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  American citizens convicted of violent crimes to El Salvador. And Robert says that Democrats [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=166.94s)]
*  are now trying to use Abrego Garcia's case to draw a line in the sand. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=172.02s)]
*  There's concern about if we let this case go through and continue on the trajectory [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=176.74s)]
*  that it is, where is the line? Where is the Trump administration going to stop? And so [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=180.62s)]
*  if they don't put up the fight this time, there's concern that it will give the Trump [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=184.46s)]
*  administration carte blanche to continue to trudge ahead with no obstacles in enacting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=188.34s)]
*  any sort of policy agenda up to some pretty extreme forms. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=193.12s)]
*  The Times has learned that President Trump persuaded Israel to hold off on a major offensive [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=206.12s)]
*  against nuclear sites in Iran. Israel had been planning a days-long bombing campaign [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=210.96s)]
*  against the sites that was set to start as soon as next month. It was designed to slow [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=215.94s)]
*  down Iran's progress toward developing a nuclear weapon. The Israeli attack would have [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=220.36s)]
*  required significant American involvement, and Israel hoped that the U.S. was on board. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=224.68s)]
*  There were some signs that was the case. The Pentagon had already moved some aircraft carriers [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=229.52s)]
*  and bombers into the region, in part to back Israel up. But as the plans took shape, some [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  of Trump's top aides grew increasingly concerned that the strikes could set off a broader regional [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  conflict and that the U.S. could be drawn into an all-out war. So Trump waved off the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=243.66000000000003s)]
*  attack and, for now, has opted for diplomacy with Iran. He reopened negotiations with the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=248.52s)]
*  country over its nuclear program last weekend, and top Iranian and U.S. officials will meet [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=254.36s)]
*  this weekend to continue the talks. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=259.04s)]
*  Now three more quick updates on the Trump administration. The White House is pushing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=267.48s)]
*  forward with its plan to create special immigration visas that Trump has called gold cards. Trump [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=272.68s)]
*  says the U.S. will sell the cards for $5 million a piece. In exchange, people would get permission [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  to live in the U.S. The project is being led by Elon Musk's team, which is meeting with [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=284.26s)]
*  various agencies to build out an application process for the cards. It marks an expansion [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=288.92s)]
*  of its role, moving beyond cost-cutting efforts to projects designed to raise revenue for [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=294.06s)]
*  the government. Also, the National Institutes of Health has indicated it will cut off hundreds [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=298.6s)]
*  of millions of dollars in funding for research into the health effects of climate change. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=304.34s)]
*  That will drastically limit the study of what effect extreme climate events like wildfires [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  and heat waves have on human health. A range of conditions, from asthma flare-ups to heart [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=314.34s)]
*  attacks to a higher risk of strokes, have already been linked to climate change. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=319.76s)]
*  And President Trump's trade policy is facing its largest legal challenge yet. Yesterday, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=325.5s)]
*  California's governor filed a lawsuit against Trump, saying that his flurry of tariffs is [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=331.1s)]
*  unlawful and should not be enforced. Trump has argued that a 1970s law gives him the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=335.06s)]
*  power to unilaterally enact new tariffs. But California, which is one of the largest economies [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  in the world, is arguing that, under the Constitution, only Congress has that power. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  In Texas, school choice activists have scored a major victory, as state lawmakers voted [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=350.14s)]
*  to make one of the largest taxpayer-funded voucher programs in the country. If the plan [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=370.3s)]
*  is signed into law, as expected, parents would get thousands of dollars to spend on private [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=374.64s)]
*  school tuition or homeschooling costs. Critics say that this kind of voucher system could [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=379.3s)]
*  strain public school budgets and lead to larger class sizes there. But many conservatives [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=383.70000000000005s)]
*  have long argued that vouchers are essential for parents who want to take their kids out [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=388.82000000000005s)]
*  of underperforming public schools. That movement picked up steam during the pandemic, as Republicans, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=392.70000000000005s)]
*  in particular, started pushing for more parental control over education. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=398.22s)]
*  Texas was the last major Republican-led state to enact the vouchers. Now, private school [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=402.86s)]
*  choice advocates say they'll turn their attention to Washington pushing for a nationwide voucher system. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=407.82s)]
*  And finally, copy baras, the laid-back dog-sized rodents, have become a darling of the modern [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=423.05999999999995s)]
*  internet. They're plump, they're mostly mellow, and they're, can we just say it, adorable. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=429.29999999999995s)]
*  But in a fast-growing ritzy suburb of Buenos Aires, Argentina, they've also become a menace, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=435.94s)]
*  as new development has pushed the animals out of the nearby forest and into the community. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=441.14s)]
*  The moment I passed the security gate, there were capybaras grazing on the medians, dozing on the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=445.94s)]
*  volleyball courts, waiting in the artificial lagoons, and I even saw numerous capybara crossing signs. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=451.62s)]
*  My colleague Jack Nickus recently went to the suburb to see how it's coping with its [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=458.9s)]
*  capybara crisis. They have caused traffic accidents, they've eaten people's gardens, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=463.54s)]
*  and on a few occasions they have attacked some of the community's dogs. And as a result, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=468.74s)]
*  now the community is doing something about it. They're deciding to sterilize the capybaras. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=473.94s)]
*  Their approach to sterilization is to use a drug that was initially designed for pigs [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=480.34000000000003s)]
*  before slaughter. They hope that this will work and the capybaras population will slowly fall [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=485.46000000000004s)]
*  and get under control. But the reality is they're not exactly sure what the results will be. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=491.54s)]
*  This drug has never been tested on the capybaras. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=496.5s)]
*  The growth of capybaras has caused a real debate inside of the community. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=500.42s)]
*  Some neighbors feel they're a nuisance, but many other neighbors are trying to defend the capybaras, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=504.66s)]
*  arguing that it's not that the animals invaded our neighborhood, we invaded theirs. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=509.62s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, a look at the government's anti-trust case [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=522.02s)]
*  against the tech giant Metta and what its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said on the witness stand. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=526.3399999999999s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app or listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=532.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm Amelia Nirenberg. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTBps9d84w&t=536.7399999999999s)]
