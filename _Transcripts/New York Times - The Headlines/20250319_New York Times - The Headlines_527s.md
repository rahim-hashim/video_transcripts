# Judge Moves to Limit Musk’s Power, and a Social Security Shake-Up
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, March [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=0.0s)]
*  19th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=7.12s)]
*  In the past 24 hours, President Trump and his administration have faced a flurry of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=14.0s)]
*  pushback from the courts. There have been three significant updates. First, a federal [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=18.88s)]
*  judge ruled that Elon Musk's efforts to shut down USAID likely violated the Constitution [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=24.5s)]
*  in multiple ways. In the ruling, the judge said that Musk was acting as a government [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=31.36s)]
*  official without being properly appointed. He also said it was Congress's right to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=36.14s)]
*  oversee the foreign aid agency, and Musk was stepping on that authority. The order appears [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=41.7s)]
*  to be the first time a judge has tried to directly rein in Musk himself and challenge [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=47.7s)]
*  the power that he's been exerting over federal agencies. The judge ordered Musk and his team [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=53.14s)]
*  to stop all work related to the shutdown of USAID and for its operations to be partly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=58.14s)]
*  restored. That's likely to have limited impact since the agency has already been stripped [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  down to a skeleton staff and nearly all of its contracts have been cancelled. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  Also yesterday, another federal judge temporarily blocked the administration from pushing transgender [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=76.62s)]
*  people out of the military. The Department of Defense, following President Trump's lead, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=82.58s)]
*  had adopted a policy saying trans people were not fit to serve because they were not living [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=88.3s)]
*  honorable, truthful lives. The judge forcefully rejected that argument, saying the administration [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=93.3s)]
*  had used derogatory language to target a vulnerable group. She also said that the data the Defense [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=100.02s)]
*  Department used to try and justify the ban was cherry-picked and, quote, totally grossly [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=106.1s)]
*  misleading. At the moment, about 0.2% of the armed forces identifies as transgender. The [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=111.86s)]
*  ruling means that, for now, they will be able to continue serving, though some of them have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=118.5s)]
*  said that since Trump took office, they've already been denied medical care, sent home [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=123.06s)]
*  from deployments, or put on administrative leave. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=127.78s)]
*  And Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to directly rebuke President Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=134.14s)]
*  yesterday after he lashed out at a lower court judge. Trump had called the federal judge [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=139.94s)]
*  who's been in a showdown with the administration over recent deportation flights a, quote, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=145.78s)]
*  radical left lunatic and said he should be impeached. Hours later, Roberts put out a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=150.86s)]
*  public statement saying that, quote, impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=156.94s)]
*  concerning a judicial decision. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=162.3s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts issues public statements very rarely and only when he is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=164.46s)]
*  apparently really upset. Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court for the Times. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=170.9s)]
*  Roberts wasn't taking sides over an important dispute. What he was saying, though, was that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=175.74s)]
*  there's a right way and a wrong way to express your displeasure with a judicial decision [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=181.86s)]
*  that you lose. The right way, he says, is to appeal it. The wrong way is to try to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=187.82s)]
*  impeach the judge whose decision you disagree with. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=194.98s)]
*  We had a great call. It lasted almost two hours. Talked about a lot of things and toward [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=203.22s)]
*  getting it to peace. And we talked about other things also. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=208.5s)]
*  President Trump had a call with Vladimir Putin yesterday in which the Russian president said [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=211.7s)]
*  he is open to pausing some of his military strikes on Ukraine. He said Russia would stop [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=216.38s)]
*  hitting energy infrastructure like power plants or oil fields as long as Ukraine does, too. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=222.3s)]
*  But Putin did not agree to a broader ceasefire that the U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=228.86s)]
*  saying that he was for it in principle but didn't agree with all the terms. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=234.06s)]
*  The reason he's packaging it that way is because he wants to continue the warm relations with [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=238.3s)]
*  Donald Trump and with this White House. And so the easiest thing for him to do is to say, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=244.9s)]
*  yes, absolutely, I agree with you. But here are some conditions that you would have to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=249.9s)]
*  take into account for me to sign on to this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=254.38s)]
*  Paul Sony covers Russia for the Times. He says the conditions that Putin is demanding [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=257.02s)]
*  are ones that he knows Ukraine will reject. And that may be the point. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=262.02s)]
*  I think the broader fear here is that Putin is playing for time, right? That he is trying [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=266.78s)]
*  to keep these talks going while he presses his advantage on the battlefield and while [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=271.18s)]
*  relations sour between the United States and Ukraine, which will make Ukraine weaker over time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=276.7s)]
*  The Social Security Administration has announced that people who want to file for benefits or [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  make updates to how they get their payments will no longer be able to do that over the phone. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=291.58s)]
*  As of the end of the month, they'll need to go online or visit a Social Security office in person. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=297.26000000000005s)]
*  The agency said the change is intended to help protect against fraud. For the past few months, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  President Trump and Elon Musk have frequently repeated false claims about dead people collecting [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=308.22s)]
*  benefits. The change will likely make it harder for older Americans or those with disabilities [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=313.58000000000004s)]
*  to access services. They're often not as mobile or struggle with technology. And it could add new [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=319.5s)]
*  stress to a system that's already in demand. The average callback time to make an in-person [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=325.82s)]
*  appointment is more than two hours. And the waiting list for those appointments is over a month long. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=331.42s)]
*  Social Security staffers tell the Times that the situation may only get worse. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=338.14s)]
*  The Trump Administration has plans to cut more than 10 percent of the agency's workforce [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=342.62s)]
*  when staffing is already at a 50-year low. Fewer staff could mean that people's payments get [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  disrupted or delayed. The Dragon capsule just minutes ago was going over 17,000 miles per hour [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=353.34s)]
*  and now gently coasting to a soft splashdown. After a much longer trip to space than anyone [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=367.82s)]
*  expected, astronauts Sonny Williams and Butch Wilmore have finally made it home. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  And splashdown. Crew nine back on Earth. The pair landed safely last night off the Gulf [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=380.06s)]
*  Coast of Florida after technical troubles kept them on the International Space Station for over [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=386.46s)]
*  nine months. Some harnessing being placed around the capsule. Wow, we got a cute little pod of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=391.5s)]
*  dolphins. It wasn't just one or two. Their craft was briefly swarmed by a group of curious dolphins [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=397.42s)]
*  as the recovery team took a boat out to meet them. The astronauts were lifted onto gurneys. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=403.5s)]
*  Their bodies are still readjusting to gravity. Then they were flown to the Johnson Space Center [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=409.34s)]
*  in Houston for medical evaluation. NASA said they'd be reunited with their families as soon as possible. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=413.9s)]
*  And finally, convictions have come down in the case of a stolen solid gold toilet. The toilet [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=426.38s)]
*  was a conceptual art piece made of 18 karat gold and it was on display at a palace near Oxford, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=433.26s)]
*  England when it was nabbed in 2019. Prosecutors say the thieves smashed into the palace one early [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=439.1s)]
*  morning, dislodged the toilet, rolled it to their car and placed it in the trunk. It weighed over [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=445.18s)]
*  200 pounds. Security footage from the scene shows one of the thieves carrying just the solid gold [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=450.54s)]
*  toilet seat as he heads back to the getaway car. Yesterday, a jury found two defendants guilty of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=456.62s)]
*  stealing, dismantling and selling off parts of the toilet. A third man had previously pleaded guilty [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=462.94s)]
*  after police found his DNA at the scene as well as hundreds of gold fragments on a pair of his [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=469.02s)]
*  sweatpants. The artist who made the toilet is Maurizio Catalon, the same mind behind that banana [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=474.14s)]
*  duct taped to a wall that sold for six million dollars recently. Of the toilet, Catalon said it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=480.62s)]
*  was intended as an absurd statement on inequality. Before it was stolen, the toilet was functional. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=486.21999999999997s)]
*  One of the men found guilty yesterday admitted that he'd gone to the palace to see it on display [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=493.18s)]
*  and used it as visitors were permitted to. When asked what it was like, he said, quote, splendid. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=497.9s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. More on President Trump's showdown with the courts. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=514.3s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdW1Og-2eA&t=519.02s)]
