# How Netanyahu Prolonged the Gaza War, FBI’s Polygraph Loyalty Tests, a Friday Quiz | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, July 11th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=7.68s)]
*  A new investigation from the Times just out this morning traces how Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has prolonged the war in Gaza to stay in power. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=19.3s)]
*  We talked to more than 110 officials in Israel, the US, across the Arab world. We got a hold [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=24.64s)]
*  of meeting notes, war plans, messages between officials. And overall, we found a pattern [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=32.4s)]
*  of behavior that shows how even as Netanyahu has maintained that he's prioritizing Israel's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=39.3s)]
*  national interest, what he has also often done at key moments is to prioritize his own [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=46.6s)]
*  political standing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=53.84s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley is the Times' Jerusalem bureau chief. He says after Hamas attacked Israel [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=55.56s)]
*  on October 7th, Netanyahu was incredibly vulnerable politically. The Times found he'd ignored [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  repeated warnings that summer that Israel's enemies, including Hamas, might be planning [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  an attack. It was damning information that could have turned the country against him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=71.66s)]
*  But Netanyahu moved to change the narrative. He blamed Israel's security chiefs instead. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=76.7s)]
*  Patrick says that was the first hint of what Netanyahu was willing to do to preserve his [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=83.28s)]
*  position as the country's leader, and that that effort has continued. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=87.78s)]
*  Netanyahu has stayed in power by allying himself with Israel's far right. These are ministers [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=92.04s)]
*  and parties that want Israel to take the most aggressive stance possible to Hamas. Some [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=100.28s)]
*  of them want to push out all the Palestinians and see Israel take full control of the territory. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=106.6s)]
*  One crucial point last year, for example, Netanyahu had even agreed to a compromise [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=113.72s)]
*  that could have halted the war. But he folded. He reversed course following an explosive [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=119.64s)]
*  cabinet meeting in which a key far right minister threatened to collapse Netanyahu's government. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=125.64s)]
*  And that moment reflects calculations that we found he made repeatedly over the last [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=133.16s)]
*  year and a half, and which is still among the factors driving his decisions about what [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=139.14s)]
*  will happen in Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=143.48s)]
*  Netanyahu's office has declined multiple requests for comment. But in a statement yesterday, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  the prime minister said the war had dragged on because of the complexity of the battlefield [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=150.7s)]
*  in Gaza and what he framed as the need to definitively defeat Hamas. You can find the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=155.14s)]
*  full investigation at nytimes.com. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=160.62s)]
*  In California, tensions are escalating around President Trump's drastic crackdown on undocumented [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=169.98s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=175.78s)]
*  Yesterday, authorities carrying out an immigration raid on a cannabis farm near Camarillo fired [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=178.78s)]
*  tear gas as they clashed with protesters who blocked the road. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=183.94s)]
*  Oh my, oh, they're literally taking someone. They're trying to, oh my God. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=187.78s)]
*  And in San Francisco this week, demonstrators confronted masked agents outside a federal [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=192.94s)]
*  courthouse as they put a handcuffed detainee into an unmarked van. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=198.0s)]
*  Wow, someone's hanging off the car. Oh my God. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=202.24s)]
*  The van then drove off as a protester clung to the hood before dropping onto the street. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=205.72s)]
*  The incidents marked the latest flare ups between protesters and federal agents in California, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=211.84s)]
*  which has become a key target in the administration's push to deport undocumented immigrants. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=217.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, increasingly aggressive tactics by immigration agents around the country have [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=222.44s)]
*  been criticized by Democratic lawmakers, some of whom say they're especially concerned [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=227.76s)]
*  that the agents are concealing their identities. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=232.72s)]
*  Authorities have frequently been covering their faces with masks and balaclavas as they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  carry out raids and make arrests. The Department of Homeland Security says they're trying [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=240.32s)]
*  to protect themselves from being doxed and harassed. But critics say that without knowing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  officers' identities, it's impossible to hold anyone accountable. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=250.12s)]
*  Immigration lawmakers are now looking to ban authorities from wearing face masks in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=254.4s)]
*  most cases. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=258.32s)]
*  Now, three quick updates from Washington. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=266.32s)]
*  The Times has learned that at the FBI, the agency has significantly stepped up its use [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=269.36s)]
*  of polygraph tests on its own agents. The lie detection screenings are widely used at [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=274.6s)]
*  national security agencies for things like background checks, but the FBI has been increasingly [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=280.48s)]
*  using them to test for loyalty and to try to root out anyone who may have spoken to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=286.12s)]
*  the media. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  Multiple senior officials have been asked during screenings if they've ever said anything [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=292.88s)]
*  negative about FBI Director Cash Patel. Former Bureau officials told the Times the aggressive [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  new use of polygraphs is politically charged and highly inappropriate, with one saying, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=303.56s)]
*  An FBI employee's loyalty is to the Constitution, not to the Director. The FBI declined to comment. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=309.64s)]
*  Also, the Justice Department is demanding confidential patient information from more [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=317.64s)]
*  than 20 doctors and hospitals that provide gender-related treatment to minors. It's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=323.0s)]
*  not immediately clear which hospitals and doctors they've targeted with subpoenas, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=328.16s)]
*  or if the providers will release any information, but the move underscores the coordinated effort [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=332.52s)]
*  between the White House and federal law enforcement to roll back transgender medical care. At [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=337.68s)]
*  least two hospitals in LA and Pittsburgh have recently shut down their youth gender clinics [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=343.2s)]
*  altogether, citing pressure from the administration. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  And, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=351.2s)]
*  What keeps you up at night? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=352.2s)]
*  Um, I would say the state of our democracy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=355.2s)]
*  At a public speaking event yesterday, Supreme Court Justice Katanji Brown Jackson made brief [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=358.2s)]
*  but striking comments about how she sees the U.S. right now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  I am really very interested in getting people to focus and to invest and to pay attention [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=368.24s)]
*  to what is happening in our country and in our government. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  During the Court's most recent term, the liberal justice wrote an unusually large number of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  opinions that included sharp criticism of her conservative colleagues' rulings. She's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=385.64s)]
*  claimed that the Court placed its thumb on the scale in favor of President Trump and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=391.48s)]
*  that it's endangered American democracy. One law professor told the Times that in Jackson's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=396.12s)]
*  written opinions, she appeared to be trying to sound a public alarm about how the Court's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=401.52s)]
*  been ruling, saying, quote, She's breaking the fourth wall, speaking beyond the Court. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=406.08s)]
*  On Thursday, the computer chip giant Nvidia made Wall Street history. It became the first [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=413.32s)]
*  public company ever to be valued at $4 trillion. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=425.08s)]
*  This is a real changing of the guard in the business landscape. Ever since 2011, one company [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=429.76s)]
*  and one company alone has dominated the top of the stock market, and that is Apple. But [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  what we're seeing here with Nvidia is a transition to a new age of computing, and that is the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=441.64s)]
*  age of AI. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=448.64s)]
*  Tripp Meikle covers Silicon Valley for the Times. He says the company has been able to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=450.0s)]
*  pull off its meteoric rise because it controls more than 80% of the market for the chips [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=454.08s)]
*  that are the backbone of AI systems. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=459.88s)]
*  What we've seen in recent months is a real conviction among investors that AI is here [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=462.72s)]
*  to stay, and that it has the potential, like Nvidia's CEO Jensen Wong has talked about [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=470.72s)]
*  for many years now, to bring forward an economic transformation that rivals the Industrial [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=476.72s)]
*  Revolution. And if that proves to be true, no one who is an investor in Wall Street wants [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=483.72s)]
*  to miss out on the opportunity to be a beneficiary of that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=489.72s)]
*  And finally, the Sonoran Desert Toad used to be able to just go about its business in [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=499.72s)]
*  the wilds of Mexico, hopping around, eating bugs, living its best toad life, until about [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  a decade ago. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=515.1600000000001s)]
*  You all may not know about this, but there are actually psychoactive toads out there. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=516.84s)]
*  Suddenly the toad's superpower was headline news, a flood of coverage focused on the psychedelic [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=521.12s)]
*  compound that it secretes as a defense mechanism. Even though scientists had known about it [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=527.0s)]
*  since the 60s, it became a new obsession for people looking to get high. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=532.64s)]
*  It was the most intensely profound experience I've ever had in my life, to just get shot [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=537.36s)]
*  up into the center of existence and merge with the creator. And it sounds nuts, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=542.34s)]
*  False narratives sprung up about how toad medicine was an ancient indigenous practice [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=548.56s)]
*  in the Sonoran Desert, though there's no evidence to support that. Self-described shamans and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=553.44s)]
*  new age healers started selling the drug, offering ceremonies around it. Toad churches [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=558.58s)]
*  began popping up in California, Texas, Minnesota. People in Mexico began trapping the toads [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=563.8800000000001s)]
*  en masse, keeping them in buckets to sell to foreigners. It's gotten to the point that [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=569.48s)]
*  new research shows populations of the species are in steep decline. One expert in psychedelic [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=574.0s)]
*  research told the Times, quote, in just over a decade, we've put this species at risk [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=580.44s)]
*  of extinction in the name of healing and expansion of consciousness. The same substance the toads [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=585.58s)]
*  secrete is also available in synthetic form. So some drug experts point out that those [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=591.7600000000001s)]
*  chasing a psychedelic high could just look elsewhere and leave the toads alone. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=597.7600000000001s)]
*  Those are the headlines, but stick around. We've got the Friday news quiz for you after [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=606.56s)]
*  the credits. Today on The Daily, how Republicans' efforts to cut funding for PBS and NPR could [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=610.6999999999999s)]
*  hit stations in conservative parts of the country. That's next in the New York Times [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=617.8399999999999s)]

*  if they're not, I'll let you know about it. President Trump held a cabinet meeting surrounded [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=658.9s)]

*  going to sneak a bonus question in here. Trump found time for it. So we will too. The president [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=705.18s)]

*  of Commerce or Treasury, if I see anything that I like, I'm allowed to take it. What [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=721.2199999999999s)]

*  when he was talking to Rubio and had that moved to the cabinet room instead. That's [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=745.14s)]
*  his contribution to the cabinet room. But it's by the way, it's an incredible clock. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=750.3s)]

*  of people from getting different things through security and left some wondering what actually [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=790.5s)]
*  qualifies as a liquid. It got to the point where the TSA had to publicly weigh in substance [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=795.5s)]
*  by substance. So here's the question for you. True or false? According to the TSA, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=802.12s)]

*  dump it, or pour it, it's a liquid. And last question. It's a bird. It's a plane. It is [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=831.44s)]

*  But there is one famous actor who was supposed to take the main role in a Superman movie. The [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=864.56s)]
*  movie had a title, a director, a big budget. The actor, you're hearing him now, even got as far as [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=875.84s)]

*  Project was called Superman Lives and it got scrapped before filming started. It was going [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=900.56s)]
*  to be directed by Tim Burton. So it just, it would have had a certain vibe. The new Superman [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=907.12s)]
*  is played by David Cornsweat, who the times once wrote has quote, Arctic blue eyes and dimples [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoYn_6cktg8&t=912.36s)]
