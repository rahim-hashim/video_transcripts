# Trump Takes Office, and the TikTok Roller Coaster
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=0.0s)]
*  20th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=7.32s)]
*  Today is Inauguration Day. This morning, Donald Trump will be welcomed to the White House [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=14.22s)]
*  by President Biden. The two will meet behind closed doors before they travel together to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=19.1s)]
*  the Capitol. There, just before noon, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 47th President [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=24.56s)]
*  of the United States. The ceremony will happen inside the Capitol building, a last minute [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  shift because of freezing cold temperatures. Only 600 people can fit in the rotunda, so [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=36.4s)]
*  it'll be a very different scene from past inaugurations, with crowds of thousands watching [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  from the National Mall. Every living president will be in attendance, along with a host of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=47.04s)]
*  billionaires, CEOs and foreign leaders. Times reporter Jonathan Swan is reporting on Trump's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=51.92s)]
*  return to power. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=57.92s)]
*  I covered Trump's first term in office, and you just can't emphasize how different Washington [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=59.56s)]
*  was when he arrived here last time. It was a city primed to resist his presidency. But [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=65.2s)]
*  he now returns with fewer guardrails, a depleted opposition, a court system that he transformed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=71.4s)]
*  in his first term, and a Congress that's much, much more compliant than existed in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=78.24s)]
*  his first term. And he's also got the big money on his side. He has Elon Musk, the world's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=83.08s)]
*  richest man, literally working for his government. He's got all these tech billionaires, people [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, people who used to be his adversaries, but are now scrambling [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=94.88s)]
*  to curry favor with him. In fact, when I talk to people close to Trump, there's a point [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=101.24s)]
*  that keeps reemerging, which is he's always needed an enemy. He's always thrived on opposition. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=106.16s)]
*  The difference this time is his enemies are all but vanquished. So Trump faces a different [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=113.89999999999999s)]
*  challenge, actually governing. He's going to be judged more than ever over the next [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=119.84s)]
*  four years by his ability to deliver on the promises that he made to his voters. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump is expected to put some of his campaign promises into action as soon as this afternoon. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=130.92s)]
*  At a pre-inauguration rally on Sunday, he said he was ready to start issuing a whole [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=136.11999999999998s)]
*  list of executive orders. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=140.27999999999997s)]
*  Somebody said yesterday, sir, don't sign so many in one day. Let's do it over a period [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=142.44s)]
*  of weeks. I said, like hell we're going to do it over weeks. We're going to sign them [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  at the beginning. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  Among other measures, Trump is expected to make it easier to fire federal workers, which [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=153.56s)]
*  could allow him to clear out those who challenge his agenda. And he plans to undo some of Biden's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  climate initiatives. Some of his most dramatic first moves may center on immigration. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=163.24s)]
*  By the time the sun sets tomorrow evening, the invasion of our borders will have come [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=168.68s)]
*  to a halt and all the illegal border trespassers will in some form or another be on their way [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=176.36s)]
*  back home. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=185.36s)]
*  Trump has plans to essentially seal the U.S.-Mexico border and carry out mass deportations. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  The Times has learned that his administration is planning immigration raids in Chicago this [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  week. The goal is to send the message that it will crack down on so-called sanctuary [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  cities like Chicago, which refuse to hand over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Hundreds of immigration and customs enforcement agents were asked to volunteer for the Chicago [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  raid. It could begin as soon as tomorrow, though Trump's border czar said the final [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  decision hasn't been made yet. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  Yesterday at 11.15 a.m. local time, the ceasefire in Gaza went into effect. After 470 days of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  war, Israel and Hamas are now observing a six-week truce. Israel is pulling its troops [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  back from populated areas and freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. In exchange, Hamas [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=243.04s)]
*  is set to release 33 hostages. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=249.12s)]
*  The first to be released were three women who were taken from Israel on October 7. They [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=253.08s)]
*  were reunited with their families to tears and relief. While in Gaza, people poured into [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=259.08s)]
*  the streets to celebrate the ceasefire, but also to begin the grim work of surveying what's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=265.08s)]
*  left. Most of the territory has been destroyed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=271.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, videos from Gaza show striking scenes of Hamas militants in their uniforms [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=275.08s)]
*  fanning out, with Israeli troops gone. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  Usually when we've seen clips of the fighting in Gaza, we've seen young men in civilian [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  clothes, sometimes in flip-flops. We haven't seen them in this very coordinated fashion, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  wearing their uniforms, carrying their assault rifles, wearing balaclavas and green Hamas [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  bandanas. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley is the Times Jerusalem bureau chief. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  It's unclear whether that was simply a PR move mounted by the very last remnants of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=312.0s)]
*  Hamas' fighting forces in Gaza City, or whether it was a sign that they are much less defeated [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=317.0s)]
*  than Israel would like them to be. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=325.0s)]
*  When we saw zoomed out drone imagery of these militants surrounded by crowds of supporters, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=328.0s)]
*  we could see that these were actually not very many people. But nevertheless, it was [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=335.0s)]
*  clearly a very pointed attempt by Hamas to project strength, to show not only to Israel, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=340.96s)]
*  but also to their own people, the Palestinians in Gaza, that they, Hamas, remain the dominant [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=347.96s)]
*  force in town, and that they will have to be reckoned with in any conversation about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=354.96s)]
*  who gets to govern Gaza in a post-war future. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=360.96s)]
*  I'm so dumb coming on the internet and crying about an app, but the fact is that this has [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=370.96s)]
*  been a sense of community for me for years now, and it got me through really, really [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=378.96s)]
*  hard times in my life. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=384.96s)]
*  For TikTok users in the US, it was a roller coaster of a weekend, as the app temporarily [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=387.12s)]
*  shut down, citing the law that banded over national security concerns. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=392.4s)]
*  Oh my God, I've already opened and closed the app probably six times already just to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=396.79999999999995s)]
*  keep getting the same stupid warning message. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  Starting late Saturday night, people who opened TikTok got a pop-up message saying it was [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  unavailable, but that the company was working with Trump to find a way around that. Just [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  hours later. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=411.79999999999995s)]
*  Yo, it's Sunday. What happened? Why is TikTok back up? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  Trump announced that he would issue an executive order to push back the ban, and the app flickered [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  back to life. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=423.79999999999995s)]
*  It was only 12 hours, but it felt like so much more, you guys. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=425.2s)]
*  This time, there was a new pop-up. Quote, as a result of President Trump's efforts, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=429.2s)]
*  TikTok is back in the US. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=433.2s)]
*  But the future of the app is still very much up in the air. The law in question was passed [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=436.2s)]
*  by Congress and unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, so legal experts say Trump [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=441.2s)]
*  trying to block it would be uncharted territory. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=446.2s)]
*  Trump says he's trying to find a solution by striking a deal to address concerns about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=450.2s)]
*  TikTok's Chinese parent company. Trump wants an American entity to get 50% ownership. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  But TikTok previously said a sale was impossible, and the Chinese government has signaled it [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  might block one. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  For the moment, people who already have TikTok can keep scrolling, though Apple and Google [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  have both dropped it from their app stores, since they face fines of up to $5,000 per [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  person for anyone who uses their platforms to access it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  For more on what could happen next for TikTok, listen to today's episode of The Daily. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=481.0s)]
*  And finally, for more than 150 years, the National Mall has been home to monuments honoring [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=493.0s)]
*  presidents, veterans, the Postal Service, even horses. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=498.0s)]
*  But there's never been one specifically honoring women. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=502.0s)]
*  In one of Biden's last official acts, he signed a bill allowing the creation of a [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=505.4s)]
*  monument to the women's suffrage movement. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=510.4s)]
*  The effort to get this kind of thing has been underway almost since women got the right [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=513.4s)]
*  to vote. The most recent effort required a years-long push by lawmakers, and an exception [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=516.4s)]
*  to an existing law that forbids any new additions to the National Mall. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=522.4s)]
*  The monument's exact location and design are still being worked out, but it's expected [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=527.4s)]
*  to be unveiled in about five years. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=531.4s)]
*  Notably, there was an early statue honoring suffragettes that was displayed in the U.S. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=535.4s)]
*  Capitol back in 1921. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=540.4s)]
*  It was up for exactly one day before it was banished to a service closet for 75 years. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=543.4s)]
*  Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd6ueSy_P7w&t=553.4s)]
