# Hezbollah Blames Israel for Deadly Pager Attack, and Fed Expected to Cut Rates
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=4.88s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, September 18th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=8.6s)]
*  Hundreds of pagers carried by members of Hezbollah exploded simultaneously across Lebanon yesterday [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=14.76s)]
*  in a stunning coordinated attack on the militant group. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=20.48s)]
*  Witnesses said smoke came out of people's pockets before loud bangs knocked them to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=24.44s)]
*  the ground. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=28.12s)]
*  The pagers exploded inside homes, cars, grocery stores, and on the sidewalk. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=29.44s)]
*  Local hospitals were overwhelmed as victims poured in with mangled hands and bloodied [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=35.08s)]
*  faces. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=39.2s)]
*  At least 12 people, including two children, were killed, and more than 2,700 others were [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=40.2s)]
*  injured, according to Lebanon's health minister. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=45.44s)]
*  U.S. and other officials tell the Times it was an Israeli operation, though Israel's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  not commented on the attack. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Hezbollah's been using pagers for years, trying to get around Israeli surveillance [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=55.64s)]
*  with the old-school tech. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=59.64s)]
*  A few months ago, Hezbollah's leader told all of its members to break or bury their [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=61.44s)]
*  cell phones out of security concerns. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=65.44s)]
*  Officials say the pagers, which were ordered from a Taiwanese company, were tampered with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=68.8s)]
*  before they reached Lebanon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=72.82s)]
*  They say Israel hid small amounts of explosives, as little as an ounce or two, next to the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=75.08s)]
*  battery in each device. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=79.68s)]
*  Then, at 3.30 p.m. Lebanon time, the pagers all received a message that appeared to be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=81.64s)]
*  coming from the group's leadership. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=86.32s)]
*  Instead, it activated the explosives. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=88.32s)]
*  The attack came a day after Israeli leaders had warned that they were considering stepping [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=93.56s)]
*  up their ongoing military campaign against Hezbollah, which has been intensifying its [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=97.8s)]
*  attacks on Israel in solidarity with Hamas. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=102.2s)]
*  Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate, calling yesterday's explosions, quote, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=105.52s)]
*  blatant aggression. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  Today, the Federal Reserve is gathering for one of its most significant meetings in years. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=119.8s)]
*  Fed officials are poised to cut interest rates for the first time since early 2020. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=125.24s)]
*  Till now, interest rates have been sitting at a two-decade high as part of the Fed's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=130.04s)]
*  attempt to tame soaring prices. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=133.92s)]
*  But with inflation coming down steadily and the labor market cooling off, the Fed is now [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=136.48s)]
*  ready to basically start taking its foot off the economic breaks. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=141.64s)]
*  How much it'll cut the rate today is not yet clear, but any cut will have ripple effects [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  across the economy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=150.72s)]
*  If you're somebody who's got a balance on their credit card, one good thing about the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=152.48s)]
*  news this week is that credit card industry interest rates often mirror what the Fed does. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  So there's a very good chance that card companies are going to be lowering their interest rates [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=163.8s)]
*  very soon. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  Ron Lieber is covering what the rate cut will mean for consumers. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=169.8s)]
*  An area where the news is not as good is for savers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  If you're able to put money away in an online savings account or in a money market account, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  you've probably been earning five percent annually on your money or so. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  That rate is probably going to fall because interest rates for savers do tend to track [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=185.44s)]
*  the Fed does pretty closely. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=191.68s)]
*  The Fed will make its announcement today at 2 p.m. Eastern. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  It's already signaled that it expects to cut rates even more when it meets again in November [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=197.44s)]
*  and December. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  Instagram has launched a major effort to make its app safer for teenagers after years of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  warnings from parents and child safety groups about the dangers of social media. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=212.52s)]
*  Tens of millions of teenagers use Instagram, where there are concerns about online bullying, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=217.56s)]
*  sexual extortion, and exposure to content promoting self-harm or eating disorders. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  Instagram says with the new settings that parents will be able to monitor the topics [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=228.64s)]
*  their teens have chosen to see more of and what accounts they've recently messaged, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=232.04s)]
*  though they won't be able to see the actual messages. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  The accounts of users younger than 18 will also automatically be made private, though [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=239.88s)]
*  older teens will be able to undo that themselves. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=245.08s)]
*  Making all under 18 accounts private by default is probably one of the biggest moves Instagram [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=248.04s)]
*  has made in terms of child safety issues in its entire history. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=254.76s)]
*  And you know, the timing of this announcement is no accident. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=260.08s)]
*  Mike Isaac covers Instagram and its parent company Meta for the Times. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=264.24s)]
*  He says the announcement about the new safety features came right before members of Congress [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=268.28s)]
*  are set to debate details of the Kids Online Safety Act, which is happening today. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=273.16s)]
*  It's a piece of legislation that could require companies to put guardrails around kids' use [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=278.56s)]
*  of social media. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=282.92s)]
*  Very consistently, Meta has in the past sort of preempted Congress by announcing product [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=284.36s)]
*  changes, policy changes, but they can basically say, here's what we're doing to protect kids [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=290.8s)]
*  or make things safer online. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, that can be helpful. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  I think parents and groups that focus on safety can appreciate that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=301.76s)]
*  But at the same time, it has the dual purpose of basically having Meta try to shield itself [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=305.47999999999996s)]
*  from regulation, including a bill like the Kids Online Safety Act, because they would [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  rather not be bound by what regulators tell them to do, but how they feel the product [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  should work. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  A new report published today says that alcohol use may be one factor driving up the rates [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=323.8s)]
*  of cancer among some adults. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=334.64s)]
*  The report from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that excessive alcohol [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=337.16s)]
*  consumption increases the risk of multiple types of cancer. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=341.92s)]
*  The new study comes just after another significant survey found that even moderate and light [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  drinkers die more often from cancer than occasional drinkers. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=351.16s)]
*  Overall, cancer deaths have been going down as new treatments have become available. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=355.8s)]
*  But more and more people have been developing cancer, alarming health experts. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=361.08000000000004s)]
*  Adults under age 50 have been getting breast and colorectal cancers at increasingly higher [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  rates in recent decades, and experts are concerned that many people don't know about the links [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=370.56s)]
*  between cancer and drinking. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=375.26000000000005s)]
*  One recent study found that fewer than a third of young women knew that alcohol use [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=377.62s)]
*  increases the risk of breast cancer. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=382.1s)]
*  The authors of today's report say alcoholic drinks should have labels that specifically [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  warn about these risks. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=388.98s)]
*  And finally, more than a month after the Summer Games, the fight over one Olympic medal has [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=391.7s)]
*  flopped and now it could flip again. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=405.46s)]
*  The drama is centered on the bronze medal for the women's gymnastics floor exercise. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=408.5s)]
*  When the scores first came down, U.S. gymnast Jordan Childs did not make the top three. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=413.62s)]
*  But her coach appealed the scoring and she moved up. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=419.62s)]
*  She's won the bronze. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=422.14s)]
*  That was the first twist. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=423.82s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=425.14s)]
*  Childs collapsed in happy tears at the news and got to stand on the podium in Paris. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=429.17999999999995s)]
*  She was able to win the bronze medal around her neck. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=434.12s)]
*  But Romania then filed a complaint saying the appeal came four seconds too late. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=437.64s)]
*  And a special tribunal agreed, stripping Childs of her medal and giving it to Romania's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=442.88s)]
*  Ana Barbosu. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=447.88s)]
*  Now, Childs has appealed to Switzerland's Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=449.88s)]
*  The sports organization that set up the original tribunal is based there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=454.72s)]
*  Childs' legal team says they have video showing the appeal was made on time, but that the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=458.68s)]
*  footage. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=463.92s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=469.44s)]
*  Today on The Daily, how right-wing extremists took control of Israeli politics and what [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=470.44s)]
*  that could mean for the country's future. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=479.92s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=485.0s)]
*  My colleagues Amelia Nurenberg and Michael Simon Johnson will be stepping in starting [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15NzN9-8zOs&t=486.28000000000003s)]
