# What the Final Polls Tell Us, and the Music Great Quincy Jones Dies
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=4.84s)]
*  Today's Monday, November 4th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=5.84s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=8.16s)]
*  It's been decades since an election has been this close and we've seen polls this close [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=13.48s)]
*  in the key swing states that will decide the election. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=17.84s)]
*  So it really is sort of a jump ball or a coin toss who's going to win because the polls [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=20.68s)]
*  are so incredibly tight. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=25.5s)]
*  My colleague Ruth Agelnick analyzes polling data. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=27.8s)]
*  She says the presidential race seems to be hurtling toward a photo finish. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=30.72s)]
*  The latest polls from the Times and Siena College show neither Donald Trump nor Kamala [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=35.4s)]
*  Harris has a definitive lead in any of the swing states. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=40.6s)]
*  Looking at each candidate's advantages, Ruth says Trump is ahead among people who haven't [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=45.08s)]
*  voted yet but are likely to, while Harris has a lead among voters who've already cast [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  their ballot. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=55.32s)]
*  And then the other place where Harris is doing well across the seven states is that these [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=56.48s)]
*  late deciders, people who have made up their minds in the last few weeks or the last few [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=61.0s)]
*  days are leaning towards Harris. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=65.06s)]
*  While more than 70 million Americans have already voted, the candidates are still scrambling [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=68.2s)]
*  to keep up the momentum. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=73.08s)]
*  Now Kamala, take my Pamela. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=74.88s)]
*  Harris made a surprise cameo on Saturday Night Live. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=78.24s)]
*  Because what do we always say? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=81.56s)]
*  Kamala and Cariannula. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=83.48s)]
*  Then she spent Sunday in Michigan, holding a rally at Michigan State and speaking at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=86.68s)]
*  a black church in Detroit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=90.84s)]
*  I see faith in action in remarkable ways. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=92.76s)]
*  I see a nation determined to turn the page on hatred and division and chart a new way [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=97.2s)]
*  forward. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  Trump meanwhile held a rally in Pennsylvania where he threw out his prepared remarks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  And I tell you what, I love being off these stupid teleprompters because the truth comes [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=111.08s)]
*  out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=116.4s)]
*  Instead, he riffed about the 2020 election. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=117.4s)]
*  I shouldn't have left. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=120.2s)]
*  I mean, honestly, because we did so we did so well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=121.2s)]
*  We had such a great. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  Trump said he should not have left the White House after losing to President Biden. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  And he devoted a chunk of his speech to unsupported claims of voter fraud, which has been a dominant [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=130.84s)]
*  theme of his rallies in recent weeks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=135.8s)]
*  And then they accuse you of being a conspiracy theorist. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=138.2s)]
*  These are conspiracies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=141.16s)]
*  And they want to lock you up. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  They want to put you in jail. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=143.6s)]
*  The ones that should be locked up are the ones that cheat on these horrible elections [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=144.72s)]
*  that we go through in our country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=149.92s)]
*  Today for the final day of campaigning, both Trump and Harris will be in Pennsylvania, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  the state that their campaigns view as the make or break battleground of the 2024 race. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  On the eve of Election Day, the Times has been looking at how posts on one social media [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=169.11999999999998s)]
*  platform, Telegram, could offer a preview of potential chaos. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  Telegram has nearly a billion users and very little moderation, which has made it a favorite [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=179.2s)]
*  of far-right groups who've been kicked off other platforms. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=184.56s)]
*  Telegram was used in a small but significant way as a tool to organize on January 6th, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=188.2s)]
*  and its influence and reach have only grown since then. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=193.72s)]
*  So to try to understand what was happening there, we looked at more than a million messages [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  across more than 50 channels with about 500,000 members. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  And what we found is this sort of sprawling network of groups that are sort of set up [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=205.12s)]
*  to monitor and potentially interfere with the voting process, other extremist groups [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=210.64s)]
*  who are ready to lash out in the event there are perceived problems, and then just a huge [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=215.28s)]
*  group of different right-wing media accounts harvesting every problem that could potentially [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=220.4s)]
*  appear with the voting and turning it into kind of disinformation memes. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=225.2s)]
*  Paul Moser is a technology correspondent for the Times. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  He's been reviewing recent messages on Telegram, including those urging people to go in-person [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=232.28s)]
*  and question officials about absentee ballots. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=238.04s)]
*  Some of these really went even a bit further in one chapter of the Proud Boys posted a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=241.16s)]
*  recruitment poster that read, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=246.24s)]
*  The day is fast approaching when fence-sitting will no longer be possible. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=247.96s)]
*  You will either stand with the resistance or take a knee and willingly accept the yoke [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=251.96s)]
*  of tyranny and oppression. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  So we brought all of this to security experts and asked them, you know, how seriously should [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=257.88s)]
*  we take this? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=261.48s)]
*  And what they said is even though Telegram has a bit of a niche role, it is a place where [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=262.48s)]
*  the most extreme groups congregate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=266.48s)]
*  And it is also an important platform for these groups to organize. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=268.6s)]
*  And so in some ways, what you see on Telegram is far more likely to be something that you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=272.56s)]
*  see enter into the real world. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=277.76s)]
*  If you see a meme or people talking on Telegram about pressuring voting officials, you're [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=279.52s)]
*  more likely to see them actually do it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  And so Telegram in some ways, and this rhetoric that we're seeing debating, you know, taking [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=286.08s)]
*  action, sometimes violence against people, really indicates a potential possibility for [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=290.4s)]
*  what we could see in the coming days. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=295.5s)]
*  Over the weekend, the Israeli military pressed on with its intense renewed offensive in northern [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=297.68s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=312.72s)]
*  Since it ramped up operations there last month, Israel has been issuing a flood of evacuation [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=314.2s)]
*  orders. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=319.44s)]
*  And the Times has found that the escalating violence has left many civilians facing a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=320.44s)]
*  reality. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=325.4s)]
*  Both staying and leaving can be fatal. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=326.4s)]
*  The Times spoke with one Gazan, Rami Nasser, who got an automated voice message a few weeks [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=329.56s)]
*  ago from the Israeli military telling him to leave the area. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=334.4s)]
*  He'd already seen strikes up close. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=338.44s)]
*  His 17-year-old daughter was severely injured earlier in the war, so he packed up his family [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=340.85999999999996s)]
*  to leave. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=345.34s)]
*  Nasser told the Times it seemed too risky to use the official evacuation route, which [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=346.96s)]
*  crossed active combat zones and had Israeli troops and tanks positioned along it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=351.78s)]
*  Instead, he and his kids took a shortcut. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=357.26s)]
*  But as they crossed an intersection, shots rang out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=360.29999999999995s)]
*  Both Nasser and his youngest daughter were injured. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=363.2s)]
*  It's not clear who fired on them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  When Nasser told his extended family what happened, they decided it was too dangerous [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=367.9s)]
*  to try and get out, and they chose to stay despite ongoing evacuation orders. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=372.97999999999996s)]
*  A few days later, six members of his family, including his three siblings, were killed [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=378.3s)]
*  when a blast destroyed the building they were sheltering in. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  The Israeli military did not respond to specific questions about the Nasser family. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=390.38s)]
*  It said it's been targeting Hamas militants who operate in heavily populated areas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=395.21999999999997s)]
*  The United Nations' human rights chief has condemned Israel's offensive in northern Gaza, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=400.65999999999997s)]
*  saying, quote, we are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=405.78s)]
*  extending to crimes against humanity. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=410.94s)]
*  In Iran over the weekend, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened to deliver [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=419.34s)]
*  a crushing response to Israel for recent missile strikes on his country. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=423.61999999999995s)]
*  Tehran had initially played down the damage caused by the Israeli strikes last month, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=428.65999999999997s)]
*  raising hopes that it might de-escalate the situation rather than kick off another cycle [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=433.66s)]
*  of retaliation. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=438.46000000000004s)]
*  But Iranian officials have now changed their tone. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=440.38000000000005s)]
*  The Supreme Leader threatened both Israel and the U.S. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  The Pentagon announced late Friday that it's sending more ships and warplanes to the region. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=446.94000000000005s)]
*  And finally. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=458.5s)]
*  Quincy Jones, one of the most influential forces in American music for over half a century, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=464.06s)]
*  died Sunday at 91. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=469.62s)]
*  Jones began his prolific career as a jazz trumpeter. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=472.42s)]
*  He arranged music for a who's who list, including Count Basie and Frank Sinatra. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=476.18s)]
*  Fly me to the moon, let me play among the stars. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUy-HuI7i_Y&t=480.82000000000005s)]
