# Father of Georgia Shooting Suspect Charged, and a Pivotal Jobs Report
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=5.0s)]
*  Today is Friday, September 6th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=6.0s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=8.0s)]
*  The GBI has arrested Colin Gray, age 54, in connection to the shooting here at Apalachee [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=14.0s)]
*  High School. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=21.92s)]
*  Authorities in Georgia announced that they've arrested and charged the father of the 14-year-old [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=22.92s)]
*  accused of killing four people at his high school earlier this week. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=28.56s)]
*  These charges stem from Mr. Gray knowingly allowing his son, Colt, to possess a weapon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=32.6s)]
*  Colin Gray faces charges of second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, and cruelty [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=40.56s)]
*  to children. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  It's rare for parents to be charged and convicted in these cases. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=47.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, his son, who authorities said will be tried as an adult, will make his first [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=50.92s)]
*  appearance in court this morning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=55.84s)]
*  His aunt told the Times that the 14-year-old had been asking for help with his mental health [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=58.36s)]
*  and that, quote, the adults in his life let him down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=63.2s)]
*  While searching his room this week, police found evidence that he was interested in mass [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=66.92s)]
*  shootings, particularly the massacre at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=71.0s)]
*  This morning at 8.30 Eastern, the jobs report is coming out, and it's going to be one of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=86.16s)]
*  the most closely watched pieces of economic data in years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=90.64s)]
*  When last month's data was released by the Labor Department, stocks plummeted, albeit [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=95.28s)]
*  briefly, after it showed that unemployment was up and American companies had really reigned [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=99.56s)]
*  in their hiring in July. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=104.6s)]
*  This job market is at a really meaningful turning point. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=106.8s)]
*  It's been cooling for a while now, but we're really at this moment where we're looking [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=110.82s)]
*  to see whether that is sort of a gentle settling back down or whether we're actually plunging [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=114.28s)]
*  closer to a recession. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=119.6s)]
*  And so I think that's the big question that we're going to be looking at this job report [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=121.8s)]
*  to answer. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=124.92s)]
*  Gina Smilich covers the economy, and she says the timing of today's report also amps up [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=126.4s)]
*  its importance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=131.12s)]
*  In less than two weeks, the Federal Reserve will announce their plan for interest rates, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=132.72s)]
*  which have been sitting at the highest level in decades. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=137.28s)]
*  So this is one of the last big snapshots that they'll get of how the economy is doing before [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=140.1s)]
*  they make their decision. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=145.14s)]
*  While the Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates at that meeting, no matter what today's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=147.14s)]
*  report shows, the big question is how big that rate cut is going to be. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=151.1s)]
*  And so I think if you see a substantial cool down, you could see a situation for sure where [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=156.12s)]
*  the Fed would make a more aggressive, a larger rate cut. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  But if the job market is holding up pretty well, then there's really no reason for the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=163.98s)]
*  Fed to be sort of, you know, hair on fire, moving quickly here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  And we might see a more gradual stance from the Fed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=171.45999999999998s)]
*  Live coverage of today's jobs report, what it signals and how the stock market responds [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=174.78s)]
*  will be at NYTimes.com. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=179.78s)]
*  Hunter decided to enter his plea to protect those he loves from unnecessary hurt and cruel [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=188.94s)]
*  humiliation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=197.98s)]
*  In a dramatic move yesterday, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=200.38s)]
*  just as jury selection in his trial was set to begin. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=206.22s)]
*  His lawyers interrupted the proceedings and announced that Biden would plead guilty without [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=209.94s)]
*  any kind of deal in place. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=214.44s)]
*  He told his legal team he didn't want to put his family through the same anguish and embarrassment [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=216.86s)]
*  that his trial on gun charges brought earlier this year. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  In that case, his crack addiction and reckless behavior were thrown into the public spotlight [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=225.12s)]
*  as his past romantic partners and one of his daughters took the stand. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=230.5s)]
*  Thursday's guilty plea also signaled that his lawyers didn't think they could win the case. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=235.38000000000002s)]
*  Biden could now get significant time behind bars. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=240.06s)]
*  He's facing up to 17 years in prison. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=243.02s)]
*  He'll be sentenced in mid-December, and the White House has repeatedly said President [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  Biden is not planning to pardon his son. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=249.9s)]
*  New data shows that the number of American teenagers who are vaping has dropped to the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=261.78s)]
*  lowest level in a decade in what the FDA is calling a monumental public health win. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=266.38s)]
*  Just a few years ago, 27% of high school students said they vaped. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=273.04s)]
*  Now fewer than 8% say they do. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  The numbers come from an annual survey that the Food and Drug Administration helps run [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=280.68s)]
*  at schools across the country. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  It also found that about 3.5% of middle schoolers are vaping, a slight decline from the previous [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=287.24s)]
*  year's survey. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=292.48s)]
*  The downward trend is being driven by a couple of things, according to public health experts, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  like public messaging campaigns about the health risks of e-cigarettes, city and state [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=298.76s)]
*  bans on flavored tobacco, and stepped-up enforcement against sellers of flavored vapes. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=303.68s)]
*  The vape market has become central to big tobacco in recent years, as the industry tries [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=310.12s)]
*  to replace lost revenues from a decline in traditional cigarette smoking. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=315.0s)]
*  When asked this year if they smoke regular cigarettes, less than 2% of teenagers said [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  yes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=325.08s)]
*  Over the last three years, the Taliban have slowly issued decree after decree that have [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=329.76s)]
*  rolled back women's rights in Afghanistan. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=335.4s)]
*  But they've just issued a new manifesto that, for a lot of women, felt like a nail in the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=338.24s)]
*  coffin for women's rights in the country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=343.0s)]
*  Christina Goldbaum is the Afghanistan bureau chief for the Times. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=345.4s)]
*  She says the Taliban government there has put out a 114-page manifesto that codifies [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=349.0s)]
*  all of the restrictions on women in the country. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=354.52s)]
*  Some of those have been in place, like a ban on women's education past sixth grade. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=357.84s)]
*  And some are new, like forbidding women's voices to be heard outside their homes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=362.76s)]
*  The document also steps up enforcement against women who break the laws. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  The Taliban's vice and virtue police used to give verbal warnings for violations. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=373.23999999999995s)]
*  Now they can put women in jail. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=378.52s)]
*  Up until this moment, a lot of young women had held out hope that some of these restrictions [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=380.84s)]
*  might be lifted, that maybe they would be able to return to schools one day. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=385.6s)]
*  But now, with this new manifesto, all of that hope has been snuffed out. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  Some women have tried to find ways around these restrictions over the last three years. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=394.68s)]
*  They've opened up or gone to underground schools and people's homes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=399.36s)]
*  They've been taking online classes to try to continue their education. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=403.24s)]
*  But the announcement last month, for a lot of women, deepened their sense of depression [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  and has also made them feel like they've just completely lost agency over their lives. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=412.36s)]
*  One woman we spoke with was saying how she doesn't feel like she has her sense of self [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  anymore because she can't earn money for her family. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=420.68s)]
*  She can't use her university degree and go out and work every day and now is worried [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=423.2s)]
*  about how to feed her family. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=427.36s)]
*  Other young women we talked to said that their future now is nothing more than being a housewife [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=429.56s)]
*  and raising children. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=434.36s)]
*  And every other door has been slammed shut for them. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=435.6s)]
*  And finally, many people like to put on their I Voted sticker every election as a badge [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=441.88s)]
*  of pride. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=455.12s)]
*  And if you vote in Michigan this year, the sticker may have an updated vibe. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=456.48s)]
*  The state was one of several that ran a public contest to design the stickers in an attempt [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=461.28s)]
*  to build civic engagement with young people. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  They chose nine winners. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=469.02s)]
*  There's a cat in an Uncle Sam hat, one with a very Midwestern tagline, Oop, I Voted, and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=471.12s)]
*  the standout favorite, a werewolf ripping off his shirt howling in front of the American [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=477.8s)]
*  flag. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=483.16s)]
*  It was drawn in felt tip marker by 12-year-old Jane Hines. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=484.36s)]
*  Social media loved it, unsurprisingly, and it came in first in the public contest. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=488.92s)]
*  One fan of the design posted, quote, If there is ever a year to have an unhinged werewolf [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=493.86s)]
*  ripping its shirt off as the I Voted sticker, it's 2024. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=499.16s)]
*  For Jane, the artist, the design is about the power of voting, hence the werewolf's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=504.48s)]
*  cartoon muscles. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  She said, It kind of just came to me. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=510.44s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=515.02s)]
*  Today on The Daily, as college freshmen arrive on campus, a look at how the Supreme Court's [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyK2buq-Hw&t=516.02s)]
