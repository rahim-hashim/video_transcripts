# Trump’s Ultimatum to Hamas, and Nonstop Earthquakes on Greek Island
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=4.92s)]
*  Today is Tuesday, February 11th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=8.52s)]
*  The Trump administration and the courts have moved one step closer to a major showdown. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=14.38s)]
*  On Monday, a federal judge said for the first time that the White House is defying a clear [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=19.88s)]
*  and unambiguous judicial order. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=25.52s)]
*  The legal fight is over the billions of dollars in federal funding that the administration [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=28.48s)]
*  froze last month so they could root out any programs they felt were in line with President [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump's ideology and agenda. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=37.72s)]
*  The judge had ordered the administration to keep the money flowing, but they have not [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  fully complied, and there are reports that they've frozen even more money since then. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=44.24s)]
*  The judge said yesterday that there is no legitimate reason for the White House not [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=49.56s)]
*  to be following his orders. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  In a statement, though, a White House spokesman was openly defiant, claiming that, quote, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=55.6s)]
*  every action of the Trump-Vance administration is completely lawful, and that any challenge [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=60.56s)]
*  against it is nothing more than an attempt to undermine the will of the American people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=66.08s)]
*  The administration's refusal to release federal funds might not be the only court order they're [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=71.72s)]
*  ignoring. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=76.76s)]
*  Yesterday, a federal workers group said the administration is still putting USAID employees [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=77.76s)]
*  on leave even after a judge told them to stop. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=82.56s)]
*  If the White House continues to openly flout orders from the courts, the government could [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=86.64s)]
*  be headed towards a high-stakes constitutional clash between the executive branch and the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  judicial branch. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=96.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, a move by the Justice Department on Monday is raising questions about influence [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=99.4s)]
*  and fairness under the Trump administration. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=107.04s)]
*  The department told federal prosecutors to drop their case against New York City Mayor [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=110.02s)]
*  Eric Adams. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=115.58s)]
*  Adams was charged last year with conspiracy, wire fraud, bribery, and soliciting illegal [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=117.25999999999999s)]
*  campaign contributions. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=122.61999999999999s)]
*  He spent the last several months currying favor with President Trump, attending the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=124.86s)]
*  inauguration and visiting him at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=129.1s)]
*  The DOJ now says it wants the case against Adams dropped not because of the facts involved, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=132.06s)]
*  but in part because the charges could interfere with Adams' job, including his ability to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=138.22s)]
*  cooperate with Trump's immigration crackdown. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  In Gaza, the fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel is on edge. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=151.56s)]
*  Hamas now says it's postponing the release of any more hostages indefinitely. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=156.46s)]
*  It was supposed to release more this weekend. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=161.94s)]
*  The group has accused Israel of violating the agreement by delaying the return of displaced [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=164.52s)]
*  Palestinians, blocking the delivery of some humanitarian aid, and opening fire on civilians. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=169.68s)]
*  This morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with his security [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  cabinet about how to respond. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=180.10000000000002s)]
*  But President Trump has already issued his own ultimatum to Hamas over the ceasefire [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  deal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=187.16000000000003s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  I think it's an appropriate time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=193.88s)]
*  I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let hell break out. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=195.84s)]
*  Sitting at his desk in the Oval Office, Trump said he was speaking for himself, not Israel, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=203.0s)]
*  but he demanded that Hamas go above and beyond the original deal and release all of the remaining [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=208.04s)]
*  hostages this weekend. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=213.5s)]
*  Saturday at 12 o'clock and after that, it's going to be a different ballgame. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=215.48s)]
*  Mr. President, when you say all hell is going to break loose, are you speaking about retaliation [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=222.32s)]
*  from Israel? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  You'll find out and they'll find out too. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Hamas will find out what I mean. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=230.2s)]
*  At the same time, Trump has doubled down on his brazen plan to relocate the entire population [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  of Gaza and redevelop the territory. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=238.88s)]
*  I say we go in, we knock them all down, we just create something. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=241.76s)]
*  No more Hamas. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=245.92s)]
*  There's no Hamas there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=246.92s)]
*  There's nobody there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=248.16s)]
*  While Trump's aides have previously tried to downplay his relocation plan, saying Gazans [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=250.16s)]
*  would only be removed temporarily, Trump said in an interview on Fox News that they would [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  not be allowed to return and that they'd be permanently resettled in Egypt and Jordan. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=259.96s)]
*  Both countries have rejected that idea, which could violate international law. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=265.76s)]
*  But Trump is now saying he might withhold aid from them if they don't go along with [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=270.32s)]
*  the plan. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=274.32s)]
*  While the threat puts Jordan and Egypt in a difficult position, both receive extensive [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=275.8s)]
*  U.S. military aid. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=280.88s)]
*  But neither one could absorb two million refugees without risking massive upheaval. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=282.8s)]
*  The King of Jordan will be at the White House today, where he's likely to discuss the plan [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=287.88s)]
*  with President Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=291.44s)]
*  Santorini is one of Greece's most popular islands and has become a global tourist destination. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=292.72s)]
*  But really the last couple of weeks have seen it literally empty out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=307.24s)]
*  Nikki Kitsantonas covers Greece for the Times, where the island of Santorini has been rocked [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  by near constant earthquakes since the end of January. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=315.6s)]
*  This kind of so-called quake swarm has happened before in Greece, but hasn't continued with [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=319.44s)]
*  this kind of intensity. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=324.48s)]
*  Some scientists think it could just peter out in a few weeks or months. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=326.48s)]
*  Others think it may be leading up to a massive earthquake that could potentially even set [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=330.56s)]
*  off volcanic eruptions nearby. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=335.08s)]
*  Nikki says the uncertainty has driven nearly all of the island's 15,000 year-round residents [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=337.92s)]
*  to evacuate. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=343.52s)]
*  Responding to this sort of unprecedented phenomenon really, authorities have reacted by sending [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=344.96s)]
*  the army, emergency services, they've shut down schools, sandbanks have been set up at [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  coastal homes in the event of a tsunami, priests have been holding prayers to pray for the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=356.0s)]
*  quakes to stop, and the residents that have ended up staying are sort of split into two [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=361.56s)]
*  camps. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=367.32s)]
*  There are some who are just pretty philosophical and taking it pretty much in their stride [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=368.32s)]
*  and saying, you know, it'll pass. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=373.32s)]
*  There are quakes in Greece all the time. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=375.32s)]
*  And then there are the others who are sleeping in their cars overnight, who are worried what [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=377.8s)]
*  might happen to their business in the long term, people who have hotels there. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=382.52s)]
*  And there's a general sense of unease because these quakes are shaking the island every [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  few minutes, sometimes every three or four minutes, sometimes every 15, every half an [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=391.0s)]
*  hour, depending on the day. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=396.0s)]
*  You know, their nerves are in shreds. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=397.52s)]
*  And finally, an animated movie about a charming, adorably ugly child who is the reincarnation [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=403.24s)]
*  of a demon has become the highest grossing movie in China ever. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=419.04s)]
*  Noja 2 has had more than $1.2 billion in ticket sales in less than two weeks. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  It's got a Pixar-ish look and is based loosely on Chinese mythology, and its success represents [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=431.56s)]
*  a huge shift for the film industry in China. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=437.72s)]
*  Hollywood films used to dominate the box office there, but those no longer really break through. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=441.08s)]
*  Instead, Chinese-made movies with patriotic messaging or cultural references have become [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=446.52s)]
*  the top performers. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  The Communist Party and Chinese state-run media are hailing Noja 2 as proof that the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=453.88s)]
*  country can tell its own stories without relying on Western studios. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=459.08s)]
*  Basically, they're saying China doesn't need Disney to make a Mulan anymore, with one [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=463.96s)]
*  newspaper saying Noja's success proves, quote, no one can narrate China's myths better than [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  China itself. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=474.44s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=479.84s)]
*  What Trump demolishing USAID could mean for American power and influence overseas. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  What's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=489.06s)]
*  podcasts. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IQZj69lHUQ&t=492.26s)]
