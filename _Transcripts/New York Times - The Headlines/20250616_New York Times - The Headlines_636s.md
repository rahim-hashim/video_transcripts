# Minnesota Suspect in Custody, Israel-Iran Updates, Pope Leo Speaks to Chicago Crowd | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson in for Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Today's Monday, June 16th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=6.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  The conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate this weekend with no end in sight [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=15.48s)]
*  as the two sides exchanged missile attacks and civilians in both countries scrambled [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=21.04s)]
*  to find shelter. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=25.72s)]
*  Israeli jets bombed vital sites for Iran's oil and gas industries, and Israel claims [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=27.6s)]
*  it also hit the command center of Iran's elite Quds Force. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=32.1s)]
*  Strikes caused at least one 14-story residential building to partially collapse. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=36.0s)]
*  Israel said its goal was to disable Iran's nuclear infrastructure. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=41.04s)]
*  And in an interview with Fox News, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that Iran had enough [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=45.36s)]
*  uranium to build nine nuclear bombs, but did not provide any evidence. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=49.96s)]
*  And we will not have a second Holocaust, a nuclear Holocaust. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=54.56s)]
*  We already had one. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=57.96s)]
*  Iran fired hundreds of ballistic missiles back at Israel over the weekend, mostly targeting [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=59.84s)]
*  the Tel Aviv area. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=64.44s)]
*  The vast majority were intercepted by Israel's robust missile defense system, though some [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=66.04s)]
*  missiles hit Israel's largest oil refinery in the north of the country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=70.66s)]
*  One Israeli official said Iran was targeting the country's energy infrastructure and trying [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=74.76s)]
*  to, quote, plunge Israel into darkness. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  As of Monday, Iran's health ministry said Israeli strikes had killed at least 224 people, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=82.34s)]
*  most of them civilians, including at least 20 children, and more than 1,400 people have [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=88.14s)]
*  been injured. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=92.7s)]
*  Israel said Iranian missiles have killed around two dozen people, all civilians, and injured [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=94.42s)]
*  hundreds. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=99.14s)]
*  This is the deadliest and most direct confrontation between the two countries in decades. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=100.14s)]
*  My colleague Farnaz Fasihi covers Iran for The Times. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=105.04s)]
*  I've been talking to Iranians living in Tehran and in some other cities, and I really sense [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=107.82s)]
*  a frenzy and panic taking hold. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=114.16s)]
*  There's a shortage of gasoline in the city. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  Lots of apartment buildings have been struck in very densely populated residential areas, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  and people are panicking because they don't know if their neighborhood is going to be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  targeted, if they're safe in their homes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=130.44s)]
*  Roads around the city are packed with traffic. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  There are people who have scrambled whatever they can in a suitcase and are trying to flag [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=136.36s)]
*  down cabs on the streets. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  A real sense that war has arrived. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  I think for Iran's government, the question is how far Israel's going to expand its attack [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=148.78s)]
*  of targets. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=154.36s)]
*  Is it going to continue crippling their key energy infrastructure or move on to transportation, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=155.78000000000003s)]
*  to shipping ports? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  No one knows what the exit strategy is from both sides, how long this is going to go on. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=164.1s)]
*  And of course, as you know, beyond Iran and Israel, there is a real concern internationally [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  that this war can spread to the region, the United States might get dragged in, and then [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=175.62s)]
*  we're looking at a prolonged conflict that could really be catastrophic. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=182.62s)]
*  Before Israel's initial attack on Friday, nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran had [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=188.14s)]
*  been scheduled to take place yesterday. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=192.58s)]
*  Those talks have been called off until further notice. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=194.94000000000003s)]
*  Both Iran and the U.S., though, say they're still open to a deal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=198.08s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=208.62s)]
*  After a two-day manhunt, two sleepless nights, law enforcement have apprehended Vance Bolter. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=209.62s)]
*  In Minnesota, the largest manhunt in state history is over. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=216.02s)]
*  Last night, police arrested the man suspected of assassinating a state lawmaker and her [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=220.4s)]
*  husband. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=224.52s)]
*  The suspect has also been charged with shooting a second lawmaker and his spouse, who survived [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=225.52s)]
*  the attack early Saturday morning. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=230.24s)]
*  The manhunt lasted nearly two days and ended near the town of Green Isle, about an hour [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  southwest of Minneapolis. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=237.12s)]
*  Authorities found the man thanks to a local tip. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=239.72s)]
*  Someone had seen the suspect on a trail camera and notified law enforcement who surrounded [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  the area. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=246.32s)]
*  The suspect crawled to law enforcement teams and was placed under arrest at that point [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=247.32s)]
*  in time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  There was no use of force by any member of law enforcement that was out there, and the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=252.56s)]
*  suspect was taken into custody. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=256.12s)]
*  Officials say the suspect, Vance Bolter, first went to the home of Democratic State Senator [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=258.28s)]
*  John Hoffman early Saturday morning. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=262.48s)]
*  He shot Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, both of whom survived. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=265.0s)]
*  He then drove to the home of Democratic Representative Melissa Hortman, who served as Minnesota's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=268.88s)]
*  Speaker of the House for six years. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=273.4s)]
*  Police say he first shot her husband, then killed the lawmaker. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=275.92s)]
*  Officials say Bolter impersonated a police officer as he carried out the shootings. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=280.48s)]
*  He wore a rubber mask, had a fake badge, and drove a car designed to look like a police [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=284.6s)]
*  vehicle. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=289.32s)]
*  Officers also found a notebook in his car with a list of other Democratic officials [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  and their addresses, along with a handgun and at least three AK-47 assault rifles. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  Police have not said what his motive was. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=300.68s)]
*  One of the suspect's friends said he was a Trump supporter and a devout Christian who [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=303.04s)]
*  strongly opposed abortion. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=306.48s)]
*  As of now, investigators say they believe Bolter acted alone. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=308.66s)]
*  It was the latest incident in what's been a string of violent political attacks in recent [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=312.92s)]
*  months, as threats and assassination attempts have become a steady undercurrent of American [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  politics. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=322.0s)]
*  The number of threats that's been received not only by lawmakers in Congress, but judges, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=323.0s)]
*  state lawmakers, election workers has just gone up exponentially. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=330.64s)]
*  My colleague Lisa Lair has been covering the rise of political violence, which she says [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  has become almost routine. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=340.28s)]
*  Over the past year, there were two assassination attempts on President Trump, an arson attack [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=342.44s)]
*  against Pennsylvania's governor, the shooting of Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  D.C., and the fire bombing of Republican Party headquarters in New Mexico, among others. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=350.68s)]
*  And those are just the incidents that made headlines because they resulted in death [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=355.78s)]
*  or destruction. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  Political violence is fundamentally an anti-democratic act. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=363.41999999999996s)]
*  It's taken by someone who believes the system won't work for them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  And so part of the goal of such acts is to silence the opposition because they're creating [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=371.23999999999995s)]
*  an environment where political activity is wrapped in fear and threats. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=376.08s)]
*  I've spoken to a number of lawmakers who are trying to govern in this new threat environment, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=382.4s)]
*  and it's become really hard. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  One member of Congress, Representative Greg Landsman from Ohio, says he's haunted by the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  thought of his own killing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=395.2s)]
*  Every time he campaigns in a big crowd, he pictures himself lying on the ground, bleeding [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  out after being shot. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=403.94s)]
*  It's this haunting image that he can't shake. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=405.38s)]
*  And it just shows really how much this violence has become a part of everyday life for these [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=407.72s)]
*  public servants. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=414.8s)]
*  President Trump presided over a show of American military might in the nation's capital on [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=427.22s)]
*  Saturday evening, a massive multimillion dollar parade officially honoring the U.S. Army's [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=431.88s)]
*  250th birthday that just happened to coincide with Donald Trump's 79th birthday. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=437.24s)]
*  The iconic Sherman tank is here, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=443.16s)]
*  It was the cornerstone of the U.S. armed forces showing its military might in World War II. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=445.72s)]
*  The parade came amidst the backdrop of an expanding war in the Middle East, a political [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=451.44s)]
*  assassination in Minnesota, and a week of protests in Los Angeles, where President Trump [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=455.64s)]
*  deployed National Guard troops. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=460.28s)]
*  And as the parade marched on in Washington, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=462.88s)]
*  Are we North Korea? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  No! [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  Are we Russia? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  No! [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  protesters assembled in roughly 2,000 locations across the country to voice their anger at [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  the Trump administration in what organizers called the No Kings rallies. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FVcJWBpQw&t=474.96s)]
