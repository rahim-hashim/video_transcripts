# Trump’s Department for ‘Drastic Change,’ and the Race for Senate Leadership
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=4.8s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, November 13th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=5.8s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=8.36s)]
*  Donald Trump has announced he's creating a new wing of his upcoming administration, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=19.12s)]
*  The department has one overarching mandate, quote, drastic change. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=21.92s)]
*  In a statement yesterday, Trump said the newly created department will be led by Elon Musk [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=27.48s)]
*  and Vivek Ramaswamy and that they'll be tasked with making major cuts to the federal government. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=32.28s)]
*  For any given expenditure, we have to say, well, what does this do for the citizens of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=37.56s)]
*  America? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=41.64s)]
*  Like, how is this good for the people of America? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=42.64s)]
*  It's their money. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=45.72s)]
*  On the campaign trail, Musk, who was one of Trump's biggest backers, said he would slash [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=46.92s)]
*  trillions of dollars from the federal budget without explaining how. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=51.72s)]
*  He's also talked explicitly about how less bureaucracy would benefit his companies, including [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=55.96s)]
*  SpaceX. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=61.24s)]
*  If the current trend of strangulation by overregulation is not turned around, we will never get to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=62.24s)]
*  Mars. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=67.8s)]
*  For his part, Ramaswamy, a pharmaceutical executive and former presidential candidate, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=68.8s)]
*  has previously floated, eliminating the Education Department, the FBI and the Internal Revenue [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=73.76s)]
*  Service. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=79.28s)]
*  It's not clear how the new department will work. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=80.28s)]
*  Trump said neither Musk nor Ramaswamy will become federal officials, but that they'll [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=83.32s)]
*  provide guidance from outside. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  Also yesterday, Trump announced more key roles for some of his most vocal supporters. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=92.32s)]
*  He's chosen Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and Army veteran, to be the next Secretary [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=97.63999999999999s)]
*  of Defense running the Pentagon and overseeing 1.3 million active duty troops. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=103.41999999999999s)]
*  Hegseth served at Guantanamo Bay and in Iraq and Afghanistan before becoming a co-host [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=109.64s)]
*  of Fox and Friends. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  On TV, he's called for the U.S. to withdraw troops from abroad, defended combat vets accused [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=116.78s)]
*  of war crimes, and blasted diversity initiatives, suggesting that the military has gone woke. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=122.3s)]
*  We used to be focused on meritocracy and lethality, and now it's a social experiment where commanders [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=128.2s)]
*  are walking on eggshells, standards are being lowered, people aren't being held accountable. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=133.46s)]
*  That's got to change. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=137.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's pick for Secretary of Homeland Security is Christy Noem, the governor [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=138.38s)]
*  of South Dakota. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=145.2s)]
*  She'll oversee U.S. immigration and customs enforcement, as well as the border patrol, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=146.2s)]
*  making her a crucial player in Trump's promised crackdown on undocumented immigrants. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=151.5s)]
*  Noem has been an outspoken critic of the Biden administration's immigration policies, and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=157.14s)]
*  she sent National Guard troops from South Dakota to the U.S.-Mexico border. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=162.1s)]
*  She'll be stepping into a job that was marked by turmoil during Trump's first term when [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=167.34s)]
*  he cycled through six different DHS secretaries in four years. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=171.94s)]
*  On Capitol Hill today, three Republicans are jockeying to become the next Senate majority [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=179.82s)]
*  leader, where their top priority will be maneuvering Trump's policies through Congress. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=184.98s)]
*  For almost two decades, Senate Republicans have been led by Mitch McConnell, but he said [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  he'd step back from the post earlier this year. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=194.94s)]
*  The new contenders are John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas, and Rick Scott [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=197.8s)]
*  of Florida. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=202.82s)]
*  Trump has railed against Thune in the past. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=204.62s)]
*  He didn't go along with his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, and he's called both Thune [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=207.12s)]
*  and Cornyn weak and ineffective. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=211.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, Scott is a favorite of the hard right, who see him as the candidate most likely [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=214.5s)]
*  to push the MAGA agenda. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=219.72s)]
*  The Republicans will take a secret ballot vote later this morning. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=222.06s)]
*  Times congressional reporter Luke Broadwater is watching the race. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=225.78s)]
*  I actually believe that Donald Trump probably can't lose here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  He has bent the will of the entire Republican Party to him. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=233.22s)]
*  He has all three candidates pitching themselves as the best person to carry out Donald Trump's [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=239.36s)]
*  mission. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  Each one is pitching themselves as who can be more effective. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=247.04s)]
*  To me, any one of these guys is going to try to put in place Trump's policies. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=251.44s)]
*  It's just a matter of who is more likely to push back against him if he gets extreme or [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=258.44s)]
*  when Senate Republicans want to go in a different direction. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=266.44s)]
*  One of the first tasks for this Senate majority leader would typically be rallying votes to [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  confirm the president's picks for his new administration. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=278.68s)]
*  But Trump is pushing a workaround. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=281.52s)]
*  He wants Senate Republicans to essentially surrender their role in vetting nominees. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=284.8s)]
*  He says the new majority leader should call for recesses, which would allow Trump to unilaterally [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=290.2s)]
*  make his appointments based on an obsolete clause in the Constitution. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=294.9s)]
*  People appointed during recesses can serve until the end of the next Senate term without [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=299.8s)]
*  being confirmed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=304.36s)]
*  If they use the loophole, it would be an extraordinary break with norms and an erosion of the system [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=306.04s)]
*  of checks and balances that's supposed to be in place between the White House and Congress. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=311.3s)]
*  One month ago, the Biden administration gave Israel an ultimatum. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=324.8s)]
*  Improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or risk losing U.S. military aid. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  You guys yourself set this 30-day deadline. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=334.56s)]
*  Today is the deadline. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=337.0s)]
*  Did they meet it or did they not? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=338.0s)]
*  But yesterday, a State Department spokesman said the U.S. does not plan to decrease military [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=341.92s)]
*  support for Israel, despite the fact that Israel didn't meet the goal. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=347.08s)]
*  In fact, Israel let significantly less aid into Gaza over the past month than it did [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=351.56s)]
*  before the warning. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=356.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=357.32s)]
*  Essentially, there isn't going to be any consequence for Israel not meeting the... [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=358.32s)]
*  I don't have... [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=365.2s)]
*  I certainly don't have a change in U.S. policy to announce today, Matt. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=366.2s)]
*  U.S. law prohibits supporting foreign military forces that the government says have committed, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=370.08s)]
*  quote, gross violations of human rights. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=375.56s)]
*  When questioned by reporters, the State Department spokesman said Israel has taken some steps [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  to allow more aid in, and Israeli officials have denied holding up shipments. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=383.88000000000005s)]
*  But overall, according to data from the Israeli military, there's been a sharp decline in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=389.24s)]
*  the food and medical supplies entering Gaza. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=393.88000000000005s)]
*  And the Biden administration's own ambassador to the U.N. said that without an immediate [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  surge in aid, many of Gaza's residents may not survive the winter. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=401.12s)]
*  A new study from the Food and Drug Administration shows that the melatonin supplements parents [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=414.68s)]
*  are giving their kids to sleep contain wildly inconsistent doses. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=419.48s)]
*  Melatonin's been used as a sleep aid for adults in the U.S. for decades, but researchers [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  have recently seen a big uptick in kids taking it, and products aimed at kids have flooded [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  the market. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=435.04s)]
*  The study tested over 100 different products, melatonin gummies, chocolates, jelly beans, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=436.44000000000005s)]
*  and found that only half matched what the label claimed. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  Some contained no melatonin at all, while others contained up to 50 times the recommended [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=446.76s)]
*  amount, a potentially hazardous dose that could cause dizziness or stomach pain. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=452.12s)]
*  One pediatric sleep medicine specialist called the study's results alarming but not surprising. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=457.56s)]
*  Because the melatonin products are considered dietary supplements, they don't have to meet [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=464.12s)]
*  the same safety and testing standards as pharmaceuticals sold in the U.S. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=468.84s)]
*  And finally, the rise of streaming platforms has meant trying to decide between Netflix [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=481.12s)]
*  and Disney+, Hulu or Apple TV, basically which media giant has what you want. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=486.36s)]
*  But smaller niche companies have been making a play. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=493.9s)]
*  They don't pretend to have everything. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=497.16s)]
*  Instead, they've gone hyper-specific. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=498.88000000000005s)]
*  Just this fall, Hallmark launched a streaming service to bring people their trademark Christmas [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=507.72s)]
*  Kitsch and Snow-Filled romances. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=512.84s)]
*  Or there's a whole platform, Shudder, for campy horror. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=516.1600000000001s)]
*  You can also watch what seems like every brooding British murder mystery ever made on Britbox. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=519.64s)]
*  She was talking of murders in her village, and now she's dead. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=527.16s)]
*  And these kind of platforms are getting more popular. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=531.16s)]
*  More than 51 million people subscribe to at least one niche streaming service. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=534.7199999999999s)]
*  That's doubled since 2022. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=539.8s)]
*  One key to their success, keeping the budget small. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=542.24s)]
*  Hallmark's head of programming pointed out that they don't make shows set in space. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR7Im_mFpZU&t=546.52s)]
