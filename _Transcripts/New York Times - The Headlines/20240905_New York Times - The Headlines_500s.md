# A School Shooting in Georgia, and 2 High-Profile Cases Return to Court
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Thursday, September 5th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=8.6s)]
*  It's locked down. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=11.6s)]
*  Everyone's panicked. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=15.4s)]
*  The nurse is crying in the corner. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=16.4s)]
*  Lights were off. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=18.2s)]
*  Lights were off. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=19.2s)]
*  I'm hearing gunshots. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=20.2s)]
*  Sounds like a loud door being slammed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=21.2s)]
*  Students at Appalachee High School in Wynder, Georgia described chaos and confusion yesterday [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=26.52s)]
*  as a 14-year-old student opened fire, killing four people. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=31.88s)]
*  Barely a month into the new school year, some students said they thought it was a lockdown [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=36.44s)]
*  drill at first. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=40.36s)]
*  Then they heard shooting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  How many gunshots did you hear? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=42.96s)]
*  I heard three before I turned it out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  I just started bawling. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Two teachers and two students were killed, and at least nine others were injured. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=48.44s)]
*  The suspect, who attended the school, surrendered after he was confronted by police. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=53.4s)]
*  Authorities say he will be charged with murder and prosecuted as an adult. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=58.64s)]
*  Officials say he used a quote, AR platform-style weapon. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles are one of the most ubiquitous weapons in the U.S. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=67.6s)]
*  and are commonly used in mass shootings. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=72.96s)]
*  The FBI said the suspect was on law enforcement's radar more than a year ago, after anonymous [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=76.0s)]
*  tips came in about threats posted to a gaming site. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=81.08s)]
*  The threats described a school shooting and included pictures of guns. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=84.84s)]
*  The suspect and his father were interviewed at the time. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=89.36s)]
*  The suspect denied making the threats. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  His father told investigators he had guns in the house for hunting, but said his son [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  didn't have access to the weapons. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=98.68s)]
*  It's unclear if officials at Appalachee High School were notified about the threats. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=101.4s)]
*  For almost eight months, Donald Trump's federal case on election interference charges has [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=111.08s)]
*  been on hold. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=117.28s)]
*  Now his lawyers are headed back to court. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  At a hearing in Washington, D.C. today, the judge overseeing the case will start the process [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=121.8s)]
*  of determining how the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity will apply to this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  case. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=132.12s)]
*  Trump is charged with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=133.4s)]
*  The judge is expected to outline exactly how she's going to decide which parts of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=137.76s)]
*  indictment might have to be tossed out and which can survive and go to trial. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=142.0s)]
*  Today's hearing is only one step in what will be a long, tangled legal process. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=147.32s)]
*  Any decisions the judge makes will likely go back to the Supreme Court for further review. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=152.32s)]
*  Meanwhile, another high-profile case that's been in the political spotlight will also [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  move forward today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=165.68s)]
*  Pre-selection is beginning in Hunter Biden's trial on tax charges. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=167.6s)]
*  The president's son is accused of failing to file and pay taxes on millions of dollars [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=172.12s)]
*  in income from foreign businesses, among other crimes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=176.2s)]
*  The prosecutor overseeing the case already won a conviction against Hunter Biden earlier [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  this year on gun charges, though he's still awaiting sentencing. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  If convicted in the tax trial, he faces up to 17 years in prison. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=189.68s)]
*  With election day just two months away, some Republicans, from vice presidential candidate [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=197.6s)]
*  J.D. Vance to right-wing pundits, have been promoting unsubstantiated theories about non-citizens [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=205.6s)]
*  voting. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Undocumented immigrants have not been found to vote in large numbers, but the claim that [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=213.84s)]
*  they will flood the polls this year is spreading. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=218.16s)]
*  Folks, that's where you stop it, in the registration rolls. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  We cannot let these people get registered. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=226.0s)]
*  The Times received a recorded call made over the summer of a group of Republican activists [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  sharing suggestions about how to keep undocumented immigrants from voting. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=233.68s)]
*  I don't think it's unfortunate, but sometimes the only way you can find out is look for [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=237.44s)]
*  ethnic names. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't mean to be any kind of person that's... [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  What they're doing is putting together instruction kits and telling activists around the country [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  to be active in election office, talk to the election officials about this, to monitor [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=249.12s)]
*  voter registration groups. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=253.66000000000003s)]
*  Times investigative reporter Ali Berzon has been looking into Republican efforts to crack [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=256.14s)]
*  down on what they say is a threat to the election. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=260.18s)]
*  They've even created posters in English and in Spanish that have a big stop sign on it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=263.3s)]
*  and tell people to basically be careful and that non-citizens can be prosecuted. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=268.38s)]
*  And they're planning to put those up around various neighborhoods, sending them to election [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=273.5s)]
*  officials to post in that kind of thing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=277.46000000000004s)]
*  And what we're seeing is that all of this talk about non-citizen and undocumented immigrant [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=280.14s)]
*  voting is having a real world impact. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=286.46s)]
*  In Alabama recently you had an announcement that they were deactivating a number of people [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=289.86s)]
*  from the voting rolls. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=295.26s)]
*  And Texas, there the attorney general announced that they're investigating groups that they're [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=297.54s)]
*  saying have been registering non-citizens to vote. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=303.22s)]
*  You also have a number of lawsuits from Republican Party as well as other groups kind of aligned [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=308.22s)]
*  with them that are claiming that the voting rolls have a lot of non-citizen voters on [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  them and they're trying to say that local counties have to take more action around this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=320.5s)]
*  There's a number of concerns that voting rights advocates have about these various actions [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=328.26000000000005s)]
*  and the overall kind of frenzy around the idea of undocumented citizens voting. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=334.1s)]
*  What they're really concerned about is voter intimidation as well as the idea of people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=341.5s)]
*  getting knocked off of rolls who are legitimate citizens and should be able to vote. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=345.94s)]
*  And another major concern that they have is that this is another conspiracy theory that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  could be used to try to discredit the election in the event that Donald Trump loses and could [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=356.82s)]
*  be used by him or his allies as a way to try to contest results or to at least get the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=363.54s)]
*  public to have the sense that the results are not valid. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=369.18s)]
*  And finally. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=376.66s)]
*  If you were on Spotify or YouTube in recent years looking for new music and checking out [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  the charts to see what was big, you might have felt extremely out of the loop when you [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=386.14000000000004s)]
*  didn't recognize bands like Calorie Scream or Calvinistic Dust, even though they had [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=390.58s)]
*  top performing hits. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=396.94s)]
*  But it turns out it's not just you being uncool. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  The songs were not written by bands hoping to make it big. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=402.86s)]
*  They don't have huge fan bases racking up all those listens. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=406.5s)]
*  Instead, the songs were the work of a 52 year old man in North Carolina sitting at his [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=410.62s)]
*  computer, allegedly scheming to make millions from the streaming platforms. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=415.86s)]
*  Michael Smith was arrested yesterday for fraud. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=421.06s)]
*  Prosecutors say he commanded an army of bots to continuously stream music that he'd [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=424.18s)]
*  uploaded to earn royalties. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=429.58s)]
*  Smith, who is actually a musician, did write some of the songs himself, but he eventually [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=431.97999999999996s)]
*  turned to AI to crank out an entire catalog of songs by fake bands for the bots to play. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=437.41999999999996s)]
*  The songs were played billions of times and penny by penny. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=443.94s)]
*  Smith collected 10 million dollars over a seven year period. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=448.38s)]
*  The indictment lists just a fraction of the supposedly popular tracks that Smith uploaded [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=453.18s)]
*  with randomly generated names like the very catchy Zygotic Washstands, Zyme Bettwing, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=458.14s)]
*  Zyme's, Zymite, Zymophyte, Zymogenes, Zymoplastic, Zymopure. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  There are hundreds of thousands more. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=471.14s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=476.78s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at Kamala Harris's record on immigration and border security [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=478.18s)]
*  from her time as a prosecutor to her vice presidency. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=483.7s)]
*  You can listen on the Times Audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZNr1vfWR1Q&t=487.41999999999996s)]
