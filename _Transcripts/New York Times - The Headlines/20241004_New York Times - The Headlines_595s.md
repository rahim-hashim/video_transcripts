# Oil Prices Rise on Biden’s Offhand Remarks, and U.S. Ports Reopen
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Friday, October 4th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=8.36s)]
*  Offhand comments from President Biden yesterday caused waves in the financial markets and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=14.56s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=19.32s)]
*  At the White House, reporters were pressing Biden for details about when and how Israel [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=21.76s)]
*  might retaliate against Iran for its recent missile strikes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=26.6s)]
*  One reporter asked Biden if he would support Israel hitting Iran's oil facilities, a move [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=30.82s)]
*  that would dramatically escalate the conflict. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  We're in discussion with that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  I think that would be a little...anyway. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  Biden said, we're in discussion on that, then hesitated and stopped himself mid-sentence. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Even though it's far from certain that oil fields will be a target, there's so much concern [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=48.96s)]
*  about a wider war and so many unknowns that the tiny hint of information jolted the markets [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=53.52s)]
*  and oil prices rose more than 4%. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=60.2s)]
*  Biden was then asked, quote, what are the plans to allow Israel to strike back against [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=63.6s)]
*  Iran? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  First of all, we don't allow Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=69.80000000000001s)]
*  We advise Israel and there's nothing going to happen today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  We'll talk about that later. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  His answer on the timing wasn't a surprise. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=77.12s)]
*  It's been widely expected that Israel won't retaliate until after the Jewish holiday of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=79.74s)]
*  Rosh Hashanah, which runs into tonight. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=84.02s)]
*  But Biden's comments made headlines in Israel where people are hungry for any clarity at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=86.74s)]
*  all amid the uncertainty. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=91.41999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Lebanon, there are signs that Israel may be intensifying the ground invasion [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=93.94s)]
*  that it started this week. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=99.74s)]
*  The Israeli military warned people in 20 more towns in southern Lebanon to leave their homes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  immediately. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=106.88s)]
*  And overnight, Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes on densely populated neighborhoods [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=108.54s)]
*  just south of Beirut. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  The military said it was targeting an underground bunker where it believed senior Hezbollah [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  leaders were meeting. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  It's the same area where Israel killed the group's longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=121.26s)]
*  in an airstrike last week. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=125.26s)]
*  Major U.S. ports along the East and Gulf coasts are starting to reopen today after the international [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=132.68s)]
*  Longshoremen's Association agreed to suspend its strike. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=138.46s)]
*  The strike, which started on Tuesday, brought some of the country's busiest shipping terminals [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=142.58s)]
*  to a standstill and could have had widespread economic fallout. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=147.3s)]
*  More than half of container shipments into the U.S. come through those ports, and they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=151.94s)]
*  can't function without Longshoremen, who load and unload the cargo. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=156.34s)]
*  The workers agreed to go back to work after being promised a 62% increase in wages over [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=160.94s)]
*  the course of the next six years, a much higher amount than they'd initially been offered. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  But there are still sticking points as they hammer out the rest of the contract, including [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  concerns that automated machines could increasingly take the place of union jobs. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=176.05999999999997s)]
*  In Memphis, Tennessee yesterday, a jury convicted three former police officers of witness tampering [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=189.66s)]
*  in the beating death of Tyree Nichols, though they were acquitted of the most serious federal [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  charge against them, violating Nichols' civil rights by causing his death. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=199.82s)]
*  Nichols' death nearly two years ago prompted outrage across the country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=205.06s)]
*  He was pulled over as he was driving home from his job at FedEx. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=209.46s)]
*  Body cam footage showed officers giving a series of aggressive and conflicting commands [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=213.22s)]
*  before Nichols ran from them, towards his mother's house. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=217.86s)]
*  When they caught up, they viciously punched and kicked him, and then sat by for minutes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=221.7s)]
*  before an ambulance was called. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=226.06s)]
*  Nichols and the officers involved were all black. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=228.06s)]
*  The officers now face up to 20 years in prison. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=231.58s)]
*  Justice for Tyree Nichols! [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=234.58s)]
*  At a press conference after the verdict, lawyers for the Nichols' family said they were looking [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=239.5s)]
*  ahead to a state trial, where all five officers who were involved in the violence faced second [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=243.88s)]
*  degree murder charges. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=249.34s)]
*  Nichols' mother also spoke. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=251.78s)]
*  This has been a long journey for our family. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=252.78s)]
*  I'm actually in shock right now because I still can't believe all this stuff is going [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=253.78s)]
*  on. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=254.78s)]
*  We're happy that they all have been convicted and they have been arrested. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=255.78s)]
*  The legalization of marijuana has been accelerating across the U.S. state after state. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=277.42s)]
*  Tens of millions of Americans now use marijuana medically or recreationally, and there's a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=283.5s)]
*  multi-billion dollar commercial industry behind it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=288.06s)]
*  But a new investigation by the Times has found that as more people consume more cannabis [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=291.62s)]
*  more often, a growing number of users are experiencing serious health concerns. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=296.58s)]
*  So my colleagues and I interviewed and surveyed hundreds of doctors and people who experienced [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=302.46s)]
*  harmful effects from the drug. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=308.82s)]
*  And what we found is that the legalization and commercialization of marijuana has basically [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=311.41999999999996s)]
*  become something of an unintended public health experiment. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=317.18s)]
*  Megan Toohey is an investigative reporter for the Times. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  To be clear, most people who use marijuana don't have problems with it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=325.28s)]
*  But doctors told us they're seeing more and more patients who are experiencing severe [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=330.42s)]
*  side effects. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=335.48s)]
*  We're hearing it from emergency doctors, from pediatricians, from psychiatrists. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=337.18s)]
*  And they're primarily seeing harm in people who are chronic users and in people who are [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=343.98s)]
*  using the most intoxicating products. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=350.3s)]
*  There are growing cases of marijuana causing severe nausea and vomiting. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=353.38s)]
*  This syndrome can be debilitating and lead to kidney failure, seizures, and even cardiac [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=359.38s)]
*  arrest. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=365.58s)]
*  And by one estimate, nearly a third of near daily users of marijuana have this syndrome. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=367.06s)]
*  Marijuana is also causing temporary psychosis and is increasingly associated with the development [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=374.34s)]
*  of chronic psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=379.65999999999997s)]
*  While it's widely thought that cannabis isn't addictive, we have data showing that an estimated [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=384.5s)]
*  three million Americans are addicted. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=390.38s)]
*  And we interviewed people whose lives were disrupted by it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=393.7s)]
*  They couldn't eat, sleep, or otherwise function without the drug. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=397.82s)]
*  Users and doctors told us that they were caught by surprise by these health impacts. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  And there are a few reasons for that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=409.85999999999996s)]
*  Doctors have rolled out inconsistent standards, regulations, and messaging. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=412.78s)]
*  And there's little science to inform marijuana users, in part because the drug is still illegal [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  at the federal level and there are restrictions on research. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=424.7s)]
*  And the medical field is not adequately documenting harm. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  For example, there's no distinct diagnostic code for the syndrome with nausea and vomiting, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=432.82s)]
*  making it nearly impossible to track those cases. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=439.17999999999995s)]
*  And because of all of this, a lot of Americans are operating on dangerous misconceptions [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=442.7s)]
*  about marijuana. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=449.46s)]
*  And finally, Fashion Week has now come and gone through New York, Paris, and London. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  And the editors of Tea, the New York Times style magazine, cataloged the trends at over [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=464.86s)]
*  200 catwalks. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=469.46s)]
*  We try to see as much as humanly possible. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=471.5s)]
*  You're trying to soak up as many details as you can. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=473.66s)]
*  You're trying to understand who's in the room, is Rihanna sitting in the front row. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=475.78s)]
*  And ultimately, my job is to synthesize the patterns that I see. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=480.5s)]
*  Kate Lanphear is the style director at Tea magazine. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=484.62s)]
*  Now that all the shows are wrapped and complete, we're able to see what trends are actually [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=487.66s)]
*  emerging. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=492.5s)]
*  And one of those was chintzy prints or florals you'd expect to see, kind of wallpaper curtains [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=493.5s)]
*  and ruffled bed skirts in old world cottages. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=499.44s)]
*  Picture a floral tablecloth your grandmother might have had. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=503.6s)]
*  That's chintz. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  Other notable trends, accessories inspired by stuffed animals and childhood toys, fringe, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=508.08s)]
*  a lot of fringe. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=514.04s)]
*  And we are living in the age of extreme belting, including jackets or dresses constructed entirely [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=515.76s)]
*  from belts. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=521.84s)]
*  We see the trends and then it takes about six months for the clothes we just saw to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=523.3s)]
*  reach stores. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=526.6800000000001s)]
*  But it takes at least that long, if not longer for them to really be adopted by the collective [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW3y9FljCB0&t=528.12s)]
