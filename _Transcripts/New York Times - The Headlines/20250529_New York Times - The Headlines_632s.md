# Trump’s Pardon Blitz, Musk’s Goodbye, a New Tariff Ruling, Brazen Crypto Kidnappings | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=4.8s)]
*  Today's Thursday, May 29th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=5.8s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I am ecstatic President Trump's order that I got states. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=14.68s)]
*  I hereby designate, direct, and empower the Attorney General as my representative. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=20.72s)]
*  President Trump has issued a flurry of pardons and commutations this week, granting clemency [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=25.72s)]
*  to more than two dozen people who had been convicted of a wide range of crimes, from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  theft to murder to tax fraud. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=35.2s)]
*  The president himself called me to let me know that my family was coming back together. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=37.6s)]
*  Among the most high profile were pardons for real estate moguls Julie and Todd Chrisley, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  who starred in the reality TV show, Chrisley Knows Best. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=47.76s)]
*  They'd been convicted of evading taxes and defrauding banks of more than $30 million [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=51.44s)]
*  to support their lavish lifestyle. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=56.08s)]
*  Their daughter Savannah, who celebrated their release from prison yesterday, had championed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=58.62s)]
*  their case at the Republican National Convention last year, framing it as political persecution. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=62.68s)]
*  I'll never forget what the prosecutor said before an Obama-appointed judge. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=68.36s)]
*  He called us the Trumps of the South. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  The Chrisleys case underscores how Trump has redefined the presidential pardon power, turning [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=78.92s)]
*  it from a formal vetted process into a tool to reward his supporters and incentivize loyalty. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=84.8s)]
*  One of Trump's advisors leading the pardon process posted this week, quote, no MAGA left [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=91.76s)]
*  behind. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  The White House has not released a full list of its latest pardons, but the Times has identified [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=98.44s)]
*  a number of them, including a former Republican state senator from Arkansas who was convicted [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=103.0s)]
*  of accepting bribes and a major Republican donor from the 2016 campaign who violated [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=108.42s)]
*  lobbying and campaign finance laws. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=113.7s)]
*  Also on the list, Larry Hoover, who used to run one of Chicago's most notorious gangs, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=116.78s)]
*  the Gangster Disciples, which raked in more than $100 million a year in drug sales. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=121.7s)]
*  Hoover had been sentenced to over 200 years in prison for murder. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  But after years of lobbying from his supporters, including celebrities like Kanye West, his [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=130.96s)]
*  federal sentence is now commuted, though he's expected to remain in prison for the rest [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=135.94000000000003s)]
*  of his life since he was also convicted at the state level. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=139.94000000000003s)]
*  In another twist in President Trump's tariffs, many of which were rolled out only for the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=151.02s)]
*  president to suspend them days later, a panel of federal judges has now ruled that some [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=155.12s)]
*  of them are illegal. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  The ruling applies to some of the steepest tariffs Trump issued, including ones on China, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=161.96s)]
*  Canada, and Mexico. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=166.52s)]
*  To put them in place, Trump invoked an economic emergency law from the 1970s. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  He argued that the U.S. trade deficit is an emergency, giving him the power to act. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  That was a novel interpretation since the law doesn't even mention tariffs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=179.12s)]
*  Yesterday, the U.S. Court of International Trade said the surcharges, quote, exceed any [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=183.24s)]
*  authority granted to the president. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=189.02s)]
*  It's not exactly clear if or when tariff collection will grind to a halt. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=191.84s)]
*  The ruling gave the White House 10 days to comply. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=195.96s)]
*  The Trump administration has already said it will appeal, and a White House spokesman [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=199.32s)]
*  criticized the court, saying, quote, it is not for unelected judges to decide how to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=203.4s)]
*  properly address a national emergency. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, two other quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=213.04s)]
*  State Senator Marco Rubio announced last night that the administration will, quote, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=221.6s)]
*  aggressively revoke the visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=225.64s)]
*  Chinese Communist Party or who are studying in what he called critical fields. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=230.72s)]
*  The short announcement, with little detail, could upend the lives of some of the quarter-million [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=235.92s)]
*  Chinese students in the U.S. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=240.88s)]
*  They're the second-largest international student group after India. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=242.44s)]
*  Family members of even the most high-ranking Chinese Communist Party officials could attend [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=248.02s)]
*  American universities. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=252.5s)]
*  The daughter of China's President Xi Jinping graduated from Harvard in 2014 under a pseudonym. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  And American universities have long benefited from enrolling Chinese students, both financially [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=260.06s)]
*  from their tuition and at research laboratories where they've been able to recruit some of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=265.42s)]
*  China's most talented students. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  Also, Elon Musk, who once called himself President Trump's first buddy, officially confirmed [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=273.18s)]
*  his time as a government employee is ending. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=281.3s)]
*  For the first few months of Trump's term, Musk had so much influence with the president [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  that White House aides told the Times they felt he was basically holding the administration [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=289.1s)]
*  captive as he carried out a slash-and-burn campaign on federal programs. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=293.5s)]
*  Eventually, though, complaints from lawmakers and cabinet members about Musk became too [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=298.42s)]
*  much for Trump to tune out, and the two have been operating at a distance. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=303.5s)]
*  Musk has also faced backlash from the public, which hurt profits at his electric car company, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=308.62s)]
*  Tesla. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=313.62s)]
*  He said he'll now go back to focusing on his companies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=314.62s)]
*  As Musk announced his exit, he also took a swipe at Trump's signature domestic policy [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=319.9s)]
*  legislation. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=325.06s)]
*  I was like disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=326.14s)]
*  budget deficit, not decrease it, and it reminds the work that the Doge team is doing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=331.86s)]
*  In an interview with CBS, Musk bemoaned the fact that the bill will drive up government [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=336.1s)]
*  spending after he and his team were brought on to cut it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=340.66s)]
*  I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be bugged. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=344.22s)]
*  My personal opinion. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=350.02s)]
*  When asked about Musk's criticism, Trump declined to respond directly. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=352.34s)]
*  In France. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  Recently, two weeks ago, a young mother with her baby was on a street in the 11th Rondes [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  Mont-Paris, and a van squealed up. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=369.17999999999995s)]
*  A bunch of men in black with masks jumped out and tried to haul her into the van. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=372.29999999999995s)]
*  It's the latest example of these brazen kidnapping attempts of people who are either [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=382.34s)]
*  related to crypto entrepreneurs or are themselves in the crypto world. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=387.61999999999995s)]
*  My colleague Catherine Porter has been reporting on the recent string of kidnappings related [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=393.09999999999997s)]
*  to cryptocurrency. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=397.26s)]
*  Over the past six months, the attacks have grown brutal, from the daylight attempt on [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=398.26s)]
*  the young mother, to dousing a crypto influencer's father in gasoline and shoving him in a car [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  to kidnappers cutting off victims' fingers, all to try and scare up million-dollar ransoms. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=408.74s)]
*  This is happening around the world, but there seems to have just been an explosion in France [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=414.94s)]
*  and why there's this explosion in France. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=419.34s)]
*  Police are not fully clear yet. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=422.38s)]
*  They're still investigating. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=424.66s)]
*  But from what we can tell and some of the theories that have been put out is that they [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=426.42s)]
*  believe the organizers of this are drug criminals that contract out younger men who are looking [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=431.22s)]
*  for quick money and are often in gangs to do their dirty work and do quick contract jobs. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=438.06s)]
*  Catherine says officials think crypto heists are basically the new bank robberies and they're [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=444.82s)]
*  concerned that the digital nature of crypto makes it a prime target, since getting a password [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=449.97999999999996s)]
*  may seem easier than drilling into a vault. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  Some crypto experts, however, say that's a misconception. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=458.26s)]
*  Crypto may have started as the digital Wild West, but it's become increasingly secure. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=461.85999999999996s)]
*  In one recent case where a ransom was paid, authorities were able to freeze and recover [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=466.74s)]
*  almost all of it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=471.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the US this past week, police in New York arrested three people in connection [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=473.26s)]
*  with an alleged crypto kidnapping. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=478.38s)]
*  The victim was held and tortured for nearly three weeks in a Manhattan apartment in an [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=480.66s)]
*  attempt to get access to his Bitcoin wallet before he managed to escape. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  And finally, The Times is remembering the lives of two master Hollywood craftsmen whose [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=489.46s)]
*  names you probably don't know, but whose work you've almost certainly seen. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=496.46s)]
*  First, Bruce Logan, aka the man who blew up the Death Star in Star Wars, has died at 78. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=503.46s)]
*  He was the special effects designer behind the iconic explosion, which he had to pull [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=510.46s)]
*  off in the late 1970s. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=514.46s)]
*  The iconic explosion, which he had to pull off before CGI was really a thing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=517.46s)]
*  Great shot, kid! [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=521.46s)]
*  That was one in a million! [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=522.46s)]
*  To get the shot, Logan had to set off a series of mini homemade bombs full of gasoline, titanium [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=524.46s)]
*  chips, and napalm. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=531.46s)]
*  And I do remember kind of wiping some burning napalm off my arm after one of the explosions [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=533.46s)]
*  as I was walking away. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0SMwnloQno&t=539.46s)]
