# U.S. Economy Under Stress, and a Behind-the-Scenes Look at DOGE
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, February [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=0.0s)]
*  27th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  The United States economy is starting to show signs of strain under President Trump's aggressive [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=13.64s)]
*  agenda. It's still the strongest economy in the world, but economists warn that the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=18.48s)]
*  relative calm that Trump inherited could be in jeopardy. When he took office last month, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  there was stable growth and inflation was easing. Three of Trump's big policy moves [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=28.62s)]
*  could shift that. First, there's the widespread funding freezes. They've thrown billions [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=34.38s)]
*  of dollars of projects focused on infrastructure and clean energy into limbo, rattling businesses [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=39.94s)]
*  and states that had already started working on them. And U.S. farmers took a hit when [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=45.540000000000006s)]
*  the crops they export for foreign aid programs got caught up in the spending pause. On the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=50.22s)]
*  the tariff front, Trump's plans to put hefty surcharges on America's biggest trading partners [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=55.54s)]
*  – China, Canada and Mexico – could cause prices to rise at home and trigger trade wars. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=60.68s)]
*  Consumers are watching warily. A recent survey of consumer sentiment showed the largest monthly [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=67.7s)]
*  decline in four years. And the flood of government layoffs is also contributing to the unease. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=72.9s)]
*  The dismissed federal workers are a small percentage of the overall American workforce. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=79.98s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people losing their jobs at once could affect what has been a historically [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=85.26s)]
*  strong labor market. Trump has acknowledged that his policies could bring some initial [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=90.46s)]
*  pain. His plan is that cutting taxes and government spending, as well as other initiatives, will [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=96.46s)]
*  offset that. But even some of his biggest supporters have expressed concern about where [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=101.62s)]
*  the economy is headed. Last week, Larry Kudlow, a Fox business host who served in the first [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=106.42s)]
*  Trump administration, said, quote, At least for now, the economic signals are flashing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=112.18s)]
*  slower growth and higher inflation. Not good. Meanwhile, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=117.58000000000001s)]
*  We have to get the prices down, not the inflation down, the prices of eggs and various other [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  things. Eggs are a disaster. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=130.66s)]
*  One of the biggest economic issues that Trump ran on, the price of groceries, is still front [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=132.74s)]
*  and center for many Americans, especially egg prices. The bird flu outbreak has pushed [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=137.98s)]
*  those prices to record highs. Trump acknowledged the situation in his first cabinet meeting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=143.89999999999998s)]
*  yesterday and all right, you want to talk eggs? Let's do it. His new secretary of agriculture, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=149.26s)]
*  Brooke Rollins, said the U.S. was looking at temporarily importing eggs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=155.62s)]
*  But we're talking to three or four countries right now about getting between 70 and 100 [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=160.22s)]
*  million eggs into the country in the next month or two, which of course will help with [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=164.7s)]
*  supply and demand. Turning to imports may only have a limited impact on the market since [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=169.33999999999997s)]
*  the U.S. consumes billions of eggs each month. Rollins said the administration will also [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  be funding measures to fight bird flu, including developing vaccines for chickens. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=180.14s)]
*  Also at yesterday's cabinet meeting. President Trump dismissed growing criticism of Elon [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=190.46s)]
*  Musk that's been coming from both inside and outside of the federal government. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=201.58s)]
*  As Musk's Department of Government efficiency continues to fan out across federal agencies, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=216.14s)]
*  looking for what to cut and who to fire, the Times has been looking at who is on that team. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=221.5s)]
*  The White House has not disclosed most of the names of the staffers, and Trump issued [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=227.42s)]
*  an executive order that effectively shields the group from open records laws. When some [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=232.14s)]
*  of the Doge staffers have gone into federal agencies to grill employees about their work, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=237.1s)]
*  they've even declined to share their own last names. The Times has now compiled a list of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=242.14s)]
*  known Doge staffers. One big theme is how many ties these folks have to his private companies, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=247.5s)]
*  including SpaceX, Tesla, X, and a bunch of his other enterprises. They have worked at his [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=255.26s)]
*  companies and clearly were recruited through that network. My colleague Nick Nahamas has been [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=261.5s)]
*  digging into who works at Doge. He says few of the staffers have any government experience. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=267.18s)]
*  Nick Nahamas One of the Doge aides who really exemplifies what's happening is a young man, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  a software engineer named Luke Faradar, who dropped out of college, is a prize-winning [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=278.06s)]
*  computer scientist, 23 years old, and we have seen him play a key role across at least half [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=283.98s)]
*  a dozen federal agencies, including shutting down USAID. Nick says many federal workers have [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=290.62s)]
*  told him they're concerned about the young team's inexperience. They're having to walk [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=297.42s)]
*  Doge staffers through how their agencies work, step by step. In some cases, staffers have been [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=301.98s)]
*  fired and then quickly unfired when it became clear that their work was more essential than Doge [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=308.46s)]
*  aides realized. I think what we've learned is that this group is extremely empowered to break [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=313.98s)]
*  things, in their words, inside the federal government and keep moving fast and keep moving forward. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=322.62s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts has given the Trump administration its first Supreme Court victory [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=337.82s)]
*  in its attempts to slash government spending. Late last night, Roberts said the government does [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=343.66s)]
*  not have to immediately pay more than $1.5 billion for foreign aid work that's already been completed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=348.94s)]
*  That includes AIDS relief programs and other life-saving humanitarian efforts. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  The government had been facing a midnight deadline set by a lower court to make those payments, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=360.70000000000005s)]
*  but government lawyers asked the Supreme Court for more time, saying the payments posed a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=366.22s)]
*  logistical issue. Roberts' order is only temporary. The full court is expected to consider the matter soon. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=370.94s)]
*  There are more than 100,000 people waiting for an organ transplant in the United States. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=383.42s)]
*  It's a life or death issue for them. They have faith in the organ transplant system, which was [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=388.94s)]
*  designed to prioritize fairness, and increasingly it is, in more and more cases, a lie. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=394.86s)]
*  My colleague Brian Rosenthal, along with a team of Times investigative reporters, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=401.82s)]
*  has discovered that strict federal guidelines for organ donations are being regularly ignored. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  The system is supposed to work like this. For every organ that becomes available, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=412.94s)]
*  nonprofit groups called procurement organizations turn to a computer-generated list of possible [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=417.66s)]
*  recipients. They're supposed to prioritize the sickest patients. But there's been a shift, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=423.26s)]
*  and the procurement organizations are now leapfrogging over hundreds and sometimes [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=428.53999999999996s)]
*  thousands of people. Brian says that's in large part because in the past few years, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=433.26s)]
*  the federal government made a well-intentioned push to make sure no organs go to waste. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=438.7s)]
*  But under that increased pressure, the system started to warp. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=444.38s)]
*  If the organ is at risk of becoming unusable, the procurement organization can use something [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=449.02s)]
*  called an open offer. And that is when they just pick a hospital, they call them, and they say, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=454.7s)]
*  here, we have this organ. Put it into any of your patients. The organ procurement organizations say [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=462.62s)]
*  they give these open offers only as a last resort. But we found that these procurement organizations [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=468.38s)]
*  are increasingly using open offers just to cut staffing costs and save money and sometimes just [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=474.62s)]
*  steal organs to preferred hospitals. These practices are exacerbating disparities in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=481.02s)]
*  health care. We found that when organizations use open offers, transplants disproportionately [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=487.74s)]
*  go to white patients, Asian patients, patients with college degrees, and patients who are healthier. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=493.42s)]
*  What are the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=499.66s)]
*  findings of the federal contractor that oversees the transplant system? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=504.68s)]
*  The contractor said that procurement organizations should not be allowed to ignore the waiting lists [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=509.42s)]
*  and said it had ordered increased oversight of the process. The full investigation is at NYTimes.com. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=515.26s)]
*  And finally, Gene Hackman has died at 95. The Oscar-winning actor and his wife, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=521.34s)]
*  Betsy Arakawa, were found dead yesterday afternoon in Santa Fe, New Mexico. According to police, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=535.26s)]
*  no foul play is suspected. Hackman had a 40-year career in Hollywood. His breakout role and his [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=540.86s)]
*  first Academy Award came with the 1971 crime film The French Connection. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=547.74s)]
*  He became the go-to everyman who could play a little bit of everything. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=561.74s)]
*  A thief, a president, a submarine commander, a sheriff. Hackman joked it was because he looked [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=566.3s)]
*  just average. He said he resembled your everyday mine worker. At one point, he was considered the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=576.14s)]
*  hardest working man in Hollywood, churning out as many as four films a year. He did psychological [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=582.3s)]
*  thrillers, westerns, comedies. One of his last movies, before he unofficially retired, was The [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=587.8199999999999s)]
*  Royal Tenenbaums, where he played the absentee father of three child prodigies. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=594.14s)]
*  In an interview with GQ Magazine, Hackman was once asked to sum up his life in a single phrase. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=606.3s)]
*  He replied, quote, he tried. I think that'd be fairly accurate. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=612.78s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, how Trump's firing spree at the Pentagon, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=622.22s)]
*  including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has rocked the military. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=628.06s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, where you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=632.8599999999999s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacdCgV-08A&t=637.66s)]
