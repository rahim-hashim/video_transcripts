# A Fragile Cease-Fire Between Iran and Israel, and Toxic Homes in L.A.
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, June 24th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=6.76s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=8.68s)]
*  In the Middle East this morning, Israel and Iran say they've agreed to a ceasefire, raising [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=14.32s)]
*  hopes that almost two weeks of intense warfare could be coming to an end. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=18.7s)]
*  The fragile truce was first announced by President Trump on Monday evening after he talked with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=23.12s)]
*  Iranian officials and the Israeli prime minister in an abrupt move that caught even some of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=27.44s)]
*  his own advisers by surprise. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  Following that initial announcement, though, Israeli Air Force jets hit dozens of targets [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=34.36s)]
*  in Tehran and an Iranian missile barrage killed at least four people in southern Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=38.44s)]
*  Adding to the uncertainty, in just the past few hours, the Israeli military has accused [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=43.72s)]
*  Iran of carrying out a new rocket attack and said it would, quote, respond with force. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  As ever, in the early stages of any ceasefire, it's uncertain whether the truce will hold [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=52.52s)]
*  or whether it will break. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=59.32s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley is the Times Jerusalem bureau chief. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  He's been covering how the two sides came to the agreement. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=63.64s)]
*  Experts on Iran say that Iran has suffered major losses through this war, both to its [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=66.72s)]
*  nuclear capabilities and other government infrastructure throughout the country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  And that has brought it to a position of weakness in which it had little better option than [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=78.72s)]
*  to capitulate. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=84.08s)]
*  However, there's just enough in the mix to allow Iran to claim some kind of victory. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=85.8s)]
*  They fired missiles last night at a U.S. airbase in Qatar. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=93.8s)]
*  That allowed Iran to save a little bit of face. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=100.0s)]
*  Equally, Israel feels able enough to say that its campaign has been a huge victory. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=104.2s)]
*  Iran's main nuclear sites have been struck not only by Israel, but also by the United [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=110.64s)]
*  States. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=116.04s)]
*  Much more powerful bunker busting bombs. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=117.04s)]
*  And that is something that Israeli leaders could only hope for in their wildest dreams [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=120.16s)]
*  a few weeks ago. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=125.48s)]
*  And now it has come to pass. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=126.76s)]
*  You can follow live coverage of the ceasefire from my colleagues across the region at nytimes.com. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=130.72s)]
*  In Washington yesterday, the Supreme Court said that the Trump administration can move [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=145.2s)]
*  forward with deporting migrants to countries other than their own. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=149.12s)]
*  The brief order, which didn't offer any explanation, temporarily paused a ruling from a lower court, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=153.04s)]
*  which had said that migrants whom the government wants to send to third party countries should [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=158.84s)]
*  first be given the chance to challenge their deportation if they're at risk of harm in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=162.96s)]
*  that country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=167.12s)]
*  That situation has played out most prominently in the case of eight men the administration [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  has been trying to deport to South Sudan, an often violent place that most of them have [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=172.9s)]
*  never set foot in before. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=177.52s)]
*  Since they were flown out of the U.S. more than a month ago, the men have been detained [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=179.8s)]
*  at an American military base in nearby Djibouti, living in a converted container that's normally [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=183.56s)]
*  a conference room, while their case works its way through the courts. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=188.64s)]
*  Monday's Supreme Court ruling clears the way for those men to be sent to South Sudan. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  The administration has argued that the home countries of convicted criminals, like these [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  eight men, often refuse to accept them back and that the government needs to be able to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  quickly deport them elsewhere. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=205.44s)]
*  But in a lengthy dissent, the court's liberal justices said that deportees should have the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=207.76s)]
*  right to due process and that, quote, the government has made clear in word and deed [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=212.2s)]
*  that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone, anywhere without notice [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=217.4s)]
*  or an opportunity to be heard. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile in Florida yesterday, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  The governor tasked state leaders to identify places for new temporary detention facilities. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=230.52s)]
*  I think this is the best one. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=235.96s)]
*  As I call it, Alligator Alcatraz. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=237.72s)]
*  State officials started work on a new detention facility for migrants dubbed Alligator Alcatraz. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  Their plan is to put up a number of large tents at an old airfield in the middle of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=246.58s)]
*  the Everglades and start bringing detainees there next month. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=250.86s)]
*  People get out, there's not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=254.54000000000002s)]
*  Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=258.54s)]
*  Immigrant advocates have criticized the new facility, with one lawyer at the National [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=261.38s)]
*  Immigrant Justice Center warning that without proper planning, migrants could be in danger [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=264.74s)]
*  in the intense Florida summer heat, saying the plan showed a, quote, callous disregard [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=269.44s)]
*  for the health and safety of the human beings they intend to imprison there. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  Immigrants that are detained by federal officials are typically held in jails and private prisons, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=279.1s)]
*  but the Trump administration has been pushing state and local authorities around the country [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=283.82s)]
*  to find ways to boost their capacity. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=287.62s)]
*  The administration is currently holding about 55,000 immigrants. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  That's about 15,000 more than were being held at the end of the Biden administration. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=294.26s)]
*  After the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year, thousands of residents [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=298.62s)]
*  whose houses were spared thought they were the lucky ones. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=307.94s)]
*  But the times has been covering an unsettling truth that's been emerging. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=311.94s)]
*  Even the homes that are still standing might be too toxic to live in. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=315.62s)]
*  During intense fires, everyday items can become dangerous when they burn. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=319.82s)]
*  Plastic shower rods release formaldehyde. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=324.06s)]
*  A garden hose emits benzene. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=326.54s)]
*  Printers and TVs can melt into a cloud of cyanide. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=328.62s)]
*  Even homes thousands of feet away can be affected if toxic smoke gets in through air vents or [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=332.16s)]
*  under doorways. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=336.38s)]
*  To determine if their homes are contaminated, homeowners need expensive, comprehensive chemical [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=338.04s)]
*  testing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=343.22s)]
*  The Times surveyed hundreds of LA homeowners near the fires and found that the majority [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=344.22s)]
*  of those with homes still standing said their insurance companies declined to pay for that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=348.14s)]
*  testing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=352.94s)]
*  A group of them ended up paying thousands of dollars out of pocket, and the test results [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=354.82s)]
*  showed some level of contamination. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=357.62s)]
*  The test came back positive for cyanide in my kids car seat. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=359.5s)]
*  I mean, we were driving around with this car, probably for eight weeks or something at least. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=364.66s)]
*  Karina Seringer was one of the homeowners the Times talked with. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=371.18s)]
*  She said that ever since a private test found cyanide in her car, she's been pushing the [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=374.44s)]
*  adjuster at her insurance company to pay for tests at the rest of her property. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  I sent her the cyanide proof and said, look, if my car tests positive for cyanide and it's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=382.74s)]
*  sitting in front of my house, it is highly likely that cyanide can be found in my couch [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=388.46000000000004s)]
*  and in our mattresses. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=394.42s)]
*  It's definitely toxic. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=396.18s)]
*  I mean, it's so obvious that it's toxic. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=397.18s)]
*  Her insurance company eventually agreed to do tests for asbestos and lead, but not for [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=400.1s)]
*  a wider range of potential hazards. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=404.74s)]
*  As she's been trying to make sure her home is safe, she's taken on almost $20,000 in [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=407.36s)]
*  debt to cover temporary housing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=411.86s)]
*  And other homeowners told the Times the toxic fallout from the fires has left them with [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=414.38s)]
*  similar financial stresses, tapping out retirement accounts and emptying savings to try to cover [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=418.38s)]
*  both their mortgage and the cost of another place to live. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  One suggested that it might have all been easier if her house had simply been destroyed, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=427.54s)]
*  saying, quote, how do you get to go from being so thankful to wanting your house to burn [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=431.90000000000003s)]
*  down? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=436.3s)]
*  And finally, this observatory is the greatest astronomical discovery machine ever built. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=441.86s)]
*  This is the first image that we are unveiling to the whole world today. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=454.98s)]
*  More than two decades in the making, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which boasts the world's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=462.62s)]
*  largest digital camera, has released its first images of the night sky, offering a [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=467.26s)]
*  preview of its unprecedented capabilities. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=471.9s)]
*  With its 3.2 billion pixel camera, it can take up to a thousand photos of different [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  sections of the sky each night, scanning the entire sky every three to four days. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=480.02s)]
*  Once that imagery is patched together, it will reveal a dynamic, evolving picture of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  the cosmos, what one scientist at the observatory claimed will be, quote, the greatest movie [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=489.62s)]
*  of all time. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=494.46s)]
*  The US government-run facility is located at the top of a mountain in Chile, where conditions [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=496.22s)]
*  are perfect for stargazing. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  And in just a few nights of observation, the telescope identified over 2,000 new asteroids, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=502.74s)]
*  though don't worry, none are currently on a collision course with our planet. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=508.3s)]
*  Long term, the observatory's rich data set will let astronomers investigate some of the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA-UzsY0JC4&t=512.46s)]
