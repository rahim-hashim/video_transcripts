# NPR and PBS in the Hot Seat, and a Rare Protest in Gaza
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, March [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=0.0s)]
*  26th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=7.2s)]
*  Today at the Capitol, Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has organized a hearing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  titled Anti-American Airwaves, where the chief executives of NPR and PBS are set to face [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=19.0s)]
*  sharp questions about what Greene claims is liberal bias at their networks. Greene's expected [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=25.68s)]
*  to ask them about how they handled specific stories that have been hot button issues on [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=31.92s)]
*  the right, like Hunter Biden's laptop and the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Greene [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  has said that the network's coverage of those topics verged on propaganda. For their part, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  NPR and PBS's leaders say they're prepared to defend their organization's work and the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  government funding that helps support it. Any cuts could weaken their networks of TV [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=53.12s)]
*  and radio stations, which stretch from New York to Nome, Alaska. Republicans in Congress [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=58.08s)]
*  have tried to cut back that funding for decades, but this year the threat has taken on new [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=63.8s)]
*  weight. Congressional Republicans have introduced bills that would eliminate public media funding [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  altogether, and Elon Musk has also targeted the organizations as part of his effort to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  slash federal spending. Recently, both PBS and NPR have taken steps to comply with new rules from [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=79.0s)]
*  the Trump administration. PBS closed its diversity, equity, and inclusion office. NPR has changed [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=85.92s)]
*  how it approaches diversity in hiring. Still, the executives have been preparing for combative [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=92.56s)]
*  questioning from Greene and her colleagues, similar to what college presidents and Democratic [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=97.48s)]
*  mayors have faced at other hearings convened by conservative lawmakers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=102.48s)]
*  At the White House. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=109.0s)]
*  There was no classified information, as I understand it. They used a app, if you want to call it an app, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=114.76s)]
*  that a lot of people use. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=124.16s)]
*  President Trump and his administration are downplaying the leak of sensitive war plans in a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  group chat that came to light earlier this week. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=130.96s)]
*  about an attack on Yemen before it happened in a chat on Signal that seemed to have accidentally [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=136.72s)]
*  included a journalist. Trump said no one needed to apologize for it and quote, you learn from every [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=142.16s)]
*  experience. And on Capitol Hill. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=148.72s)]
*  Director Radcliffe, this was a huge mistake, correct? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=151.56s)]
*  No. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=157.84s)]
*  A national... [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=159.68s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=160.68s)]
*  No, no, you hold on. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  The director of the CIA, who was in the chat himself, acknowledged that sensitive information [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=162.48s)]
*  had been shared, but refused to call the leak a mistake. He was testifying in a previously [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=167.8s)]
*  scheduled hearing. Democratic lawmakers grilled him about the intelligence breach. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=173.2s)]
*  This is utterly unprofessional. There's been no apology. There has been no recognition of the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=177.88s)]
*  gravity of this error. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=184.32s)]
*  Some Democrats have called on Hegseth and National Security Advisor Michael Walz, who added the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=186.12s)]
*  journalist to the chat, to resign. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=191.28s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a conversation with that journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=196.0s)]
*  For the Trump administration, one defining characteristic so far has been its willingness to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=205.72s)]
*  criticize and question the courts. And The Times has been tracking how that effort to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=210.68s)]
*  challenge the validity of a whole other branch of government mirrors a trend that's been [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=216.16s)]
*  building at the state level for years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=220.84s)]
*  What we've been seeing increasingly around the country is an effort by conservative [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=223.56s)]
*  lawmakers, predominantly in Republican leaning states, to challenge what lawmakers believe [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=228.56s)]
*  are liberal courts. They've been very unhappy with some of the decisions that judges have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=235.32s)]
*  rendered on hot button issues like abortion and transgender issues. And so they've decided [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=240.12s)]
*  to introduce a whole bunch of legislation in an effort to change both the rules and even [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=245.64s)]
*  change the makeup of the courts. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=251.88s)]
*  My colleague David Chen covers politics. He says the most aggressive proposals about how to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  reshape the courts have come out of Montana, where lawmakers have suggested dozens of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=259.2s)]
*  overhauls. Everything from being able to disqualify a judge based on their facial expressions [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=263.96s)]
*  to creating an entirely new court with judges appointed by the state's Republican governor. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=269.84s)]
*  I think what we're going to see down the road is an increasing appetite by conservative [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=274.72s)]
*  lawmakers to continue challenging the system. They feel that the judiciary system has been [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=279.68s)]
*  stacked against conservatives for too long, and they feel that a big change is necessary to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=286.6s)]
*  kind of balance things out. Critics, however, say that these conservative lawmakers are [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=293.48s)]
*  just mad that they've been on this judicial losing streak. And so they want to basically [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=299.6s)]
*  change the umpires, change the refs in order to produce a more desirable result. And they say [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  that that could set a very dangerous precedent, because if you install an ump who's biased, then [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=310.8s)]
*  you're really undermining faith in the judiciary and by extension, the entire government. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  In Gaza yesterday, protesters took to the streets in a rare show of dissent against Hamas. They [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=329.6s)]
*  chanted slogans calling for an end to the war and for Hamas to give up control of the territory. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  While many people in Gaza blame Israel for the widespread death and destruction over the past [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=347.92s)]
*  year and a half, some also hold Hamas responsible for kicking off the conflict with the October 7th [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=352.88s)]
*  attacks. One protester told the Times that he wants to keep protesting until, quote, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=359.2s)]
*  the bloodshed stops and Hamas leaves. In the almost two decades that Hamas has controlled Gaza, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=364.8s)]
*  it's cracked down harshly on protesters and has been accused of routinely arresting and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=371.36s)]
*  torturing its opponents. Despite Israel's aggressive campaign to wipe the group out, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=376.48s)]
*  Hamas is still believed to command thousands of armed fighters inside Gaza. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=381.32s)]
*  And finally, a criminal trial is unfolding in France this week over chairs. The case centers [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=389.2s)]
*  on antiques purchased by the Palace of Versailles. The lot was valued at nearly three million dollars [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=400.08s)]
*  and was supposed to include two Louis XV era chairs. They were authenticated by the go-to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  18th century French chair expert, a man who literally wrote a book on the subject. But [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=412.88s)]
*  it turns out they were fakes. The expert, Bill Payot, is now on trial for his role in the scheme. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=418.68s)]
*  He's admitted that he and a woodworker basically got curious one day about just how good of a fake [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=425.64s)]
*  they could make. Their ruse raked in millions. But Payot was discovered, in part, by a fellow [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=431.0s)]
*  antique dealer who'd been raising doubts about him for years. That dealer said the subtle notes [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=437.79999999999995s)]
*  of licorice gave it all away. He told Vanity Fair that he knew woodworkers sometimes used [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  melted licorice to give wood an old vintage look. And when he saw some antiques that Payot claimed [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  were authentic, he got real close to them and, quote, I licked the chair and voila, I could taste [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=456.59999999999997s)]
*  the fraud. Those are the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=463.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYjDovYGbqQ&t=473.64s)]
