# Special Counsel Report on Trump, Pete Hegseth Confirmation Hearing, and More
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=0.0s)]
*  14th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Just after midnight, the special counsel's report on Donald Trump's efforts to overturn [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=14.08s)]
*  the 2020 election was released to Congress. The report, which the Times got access to, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=18.36s)]
*  sums up Jack Smith's years-long investigation into Trump, which culminated in charges of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=24.6s)]
*  election interference. And it claims that had Trump gone on trial, there was enough [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=29.98s)]
*  evidence to convict him. Trump winning the 2024 election, however, ended the case. The [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=35.42s)]
*  Justice Department does not prosecute sitting presidents. That makes this report the closest [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=41.22s)]
*  the public may ever get to seeing what could have been laid out in the courtroom. In it, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  Smith says Trump undertook a, quote, unprecedented criminal effort to try and stay in power, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  and that he encouraged violence against his political opponents. The report cites evidence [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=58.5s)]
*  from multiple criminal cases of January 6th rioters who said they believed they were acting [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=63.74s)]
*  on Trump's behalf. Trump's lawyers fought the release of this report down to the last [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=69.3s)]
*  minute. Around 2 a.m., after it came out, Trump himself took to social media, posting [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=74.34s)]
*  that Smith, who resigned last week, is a lame brain and saying, quote, the voters have spoken. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=80.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, the report from the special counsel who investigated Hunter Biden is also now [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=88.5s)]
*  out. David Weiss spent years investigating the president's son. Hunter was ultimately [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=96.54s)]
*  found guilty on firearms charges and pled guilty to tax crimes before he was pardoned [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=102.02s)]
*  by his father. In the report, Weiss specifically criticizes Joe Biden for claiming the charges [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=107.38s)]
*  were politically motivated. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=114.3s)]
*  Starting today, Trump's cabinet and staff picks for his new administration will face [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=122.82s)]
*  a crucial test, Senate confirmation hearings. A dozen potential nominees will be questioned [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=126.98s)]
*  by senators over the coming days, including the people that Trump has tapped to run the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=132.82s)]
*  state, treasury, and homeland security departments. The most high-profile hearing, and the one [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=137.46s)]
*  that could be the most contentious, is this morning for Pete Hegseth. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=142.88s)]
*  President Trump nominated Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense to change things. Ban [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=147.64s)]
*  woke nonsense from our armed forces and make our soldiers proud to serve. Call your senator. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=152.84s)]
*  Trump's allies have been running an intense campaign to push Hegseth through the process. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=159.32s)]
*  Despite some lawmakers' concerns over allegations of public drunkenness, claims Hegseth mismanaged [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  a veteran's nonprofit and a settlement he paid to a woman who accused him of sexual [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=169.84s)]
*  assault. They've bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of ads encouraging people to flood [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=174.16s)]
*  senators' offices with calls to support Hegseth. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=179.68s)]
*  I've heard Republicans say, please make the call stop. We get the point. We're a yes vote. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=183.24s)]
*  I always tell them that we're going to keep the calls coming until you vote yes. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=189.84s)]
*  The effort seems to be paying off. One Republican senator, Joni Ernst of Iowa, who initially [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=194.44s)]
*  questioned whether Hegseth could effectively tackle sexual assault in the military, dropped [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=199.8s)]
*  her criticisms amid the increasing pressure. Still, Democrats will try and chip away at [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  Republican support today as they press Hegseth about his past behavior and about whether [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=210.72s)]
*  he's qualified to run the Pentagon, which has almost three million employees. My colleague [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=215.72s)]
*  Carl Hulse will be covering the hearing at the Senate Armed Services Committee. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=221.0s)]
*  I do think that Mr. Hegseth's management abilities are going to be a subject of the hearing more [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=224.92s)]
*  than maybe people expect. There are bigger questions about him beyond his character issues [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=232.24s)]
*  about how he's going to treat the current management of the Pentagon and his push to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=237.32s)]
*  get rid of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and whether he's going to clean [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=243.64s)]
*  house over at the Pentagon. You know, the Pentagon is probably the most important federal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=250.66s)]
*  agency and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle want to make sure that it can be run [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=255.82s)]
*  properly. If the committee signs off on Hegseth, he'll still face a full vote in the Senate, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=260.86s)]
*  possibly as soon as Monday, Trump's first day in office. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=268.78s)]
*  In Los Angeles, the National Weather Service is warning that new powerful wind gusts could [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=278.58s)]
*  cause, quote, explosive fire growth. The winds picked up again overnight and could hit up [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=284.18s)]
*  to 70 miles per hour, and they're expected to stay intense for the next two days. That [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=290.34s)]
*  could reverse some of the hard fought progress firefighters have made trying to contain multiple [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=295.86s)]
*  fires around the city. Overnight, a new fire broke out in Ventura County, north of LA, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=301.02s)]
*  and it could be one of many small blazes that pop up and get fueled by the winds. Even once [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=307.18s)]
*  those winds die down, the area will still be dangerously dry. Los Angeles has only gotten [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=312.14000000000004s)]
*  sprinklings of rain since April of last year. Meanwhile, one of the first steps for people [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=317.42s)]
*  who have lost their homes is trying to get into a rental property. And that's been really [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=324.1s)]
*  difficult given the influx of people who are looking at these properties. Times reporter [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=328.74s)]
*  Emily Baumgartner is in LA covering the aftermath of the fires. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=332.7s)]
*  We've seen a lot of reports of price gouging, especially on the West Side. We're seeing [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=336.38s)]
*  properties that were $3,000 now going for $4,500. Families even outside of units arguing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=341.3s)]
*  about who needs the property more and sooner because there's just such an influx of demand. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=347.86s)]
*  Another issue we've seen for people whose houses have not burned down, but who haven't been [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=352.86s)]
*  let back into the evacuation zone, is a lot of fears about looting. There have been reports [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=357.62s)]
*  of trespassing and looting in the fire zones. They have been very limited, but it's still a major [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=362.85999999999996s)]
*  concern for people who feel like they were forced to leave their homes. And now they're hearing [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  rumors that are running ramparts online about people looting their properties. And there's a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=372.26s)]
*  lot of fear that they're not able to get home and defend it. Authorities announced yesterday [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=376.38s)]
*  they have made some arrests connected to looting. The National Guard has been deployed to secure [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=380.5s)]
*  the evacuation zones. For more on the fires, including a look at the government's response [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=385.42s)]
*  and whether some of the devastation could have been avoided, listen to today's episode of The [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=391.06s)]
*  Daily. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=395.5s)]
*  A new study says that in the coming decades, the U.S. will face a surge in cases of dementia. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=403.66s)]
*  According to the research published yesterday in the journal Nature Medicine, the number of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=410.3s)]
*  Americans who are expected to develop dementia will double by the year 2060. The main reason, an [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=414.78s)]
*  aging population. Age is the number one risk factor for the condition, which can lead to severe [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=420.9s)]
*  memory loss, though there are others as well, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=426.85999999999996s)]
*  and diabetes. The rising number of cases will put a huge strain on American families and test the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=431.97999999999996s)]
*  country's health care system. The U.S. already spends more than $600 billion a year on caregiving [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=439.38s)]
*  and other costs for people with dementia. But experts say that half of dementia risk is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=445.5s)]
*  preventable. Lifestyle changes and medication to improve cardiovascular health can help. So can [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=451.62s)]
*  wearing hearing aids, which push back the onset of dementia by keeping people more socially [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=458.41999999999996s)]
*  connected and engaged. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=463.73999999999995s)]
*  And finally, Central Park, the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, New York has no [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=469.34s)]
*  shortage of tourist meccas. But every day crowds also descend on a quiet tree line stretch of the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=474.85999999999996s)]
*  West Village and a brownstone at 66 Perry Street. In Sex and the City, it was the home of Carrie [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=481.65999999999997s)]
*  Bradshaw, played by Sarah Jessica Parker. In real life, it's the home of someone who would just like [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=493.53999999999996s)]
*  little privacy. In a letter the owner recently sent to the city, they said Sex and the City fans [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=499.26s)]
*  are gathered outside day and night, taking flash photos, making TikToks, and posing on the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  iconic front steps. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=510.86s)]
*  I think this is it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=513.1s)]
*  She went to close it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=515.46s)]
*  They have a chain and a no trespassing sign, but that apparently has not kept people from looking [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=516.62s)]
*  in the windows and ringing the doorbell. And the owner is now asking the City for permission to [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=521.66s)]
*  the steps of the historic home with an iron gate. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=526.94s)]
*  The letter acknowledged that while they did give permission [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=530.84s)]
*  back in the late 90s to be featured on the show, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=533.7s)]
*  they didn't expect there to be a slew of spin-offs [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=536.84s)]
*  and reruns that would keep the obsession going. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=539.1s)]
*  They wrote, quote, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=542.1s)]
*  "'After 20 plus years of hoping the fascination [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=543.2600000000001s)]
*  with my stoop would die away [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=546.3000000000001s)]
*  and fans would find a new object for their devotion, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=548.2600000000001s)]
*  I have acknowledged we need something more substantial.'" [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=551.46s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=557.94s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1oQhxS4Bcg&t=560.3800000000001s)]
