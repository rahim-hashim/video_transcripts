# Syria’s New Reality, and Trump Lays Out Aggressive Agenda
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Megan Specia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Monday, December 9th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=6.36s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=8.44s)]
*  We're here in a massive, massive traffic jam as thousands of Syrians who fled the country [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=16.6s)]
*  during the civil war are now making their way back to Syria for the first time for some [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=22.52s)]
*  in more than a decade. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=27.2s)]
*  My colleague Christina Goldbaum has been reporting from near the Syria-Lebanon border on the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=28.92s)]
*  stunning downfall of the Syrian regime. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=33.6s)]
*  In a lightning-fast offensive, rebel groups overtook the capital city of Damascus yesterday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=36.440000000000005s)]
*  And they forced President Bashar al-Assad, whose family had long ruled Syria with an [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=42.24s)]
*  iron fist, to flee the country. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=46.72s)]
*  We're seeing people cheering and honking their car horns. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=48.72s)]
*  A lot of people are blasting songs that were cheering on the fall of Bashar al-Assad. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=52.28s)]
*  Others are either on top of their cars or hanging out of car windows waving flags of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=57.32s)]
*  the Syrian opposition or holding their fingers up in a V, signifying victory. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=63.24s)]
*  Footage from inside Damascus showed families wandering through the abandoned presidential [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=68.88s)]
*  palace, taking artwork in chairs and posing for selfies. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=73.12s)]
*  It's a remarkable turn in a brutal civil war that was sparked by the Arab Spring in 2011. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=77.72s)]
*  More than 500,000 people have been killed in the conflict, and millions more were forced [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=83.6s)]
*  from their homes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  Now, the question hanging over Syria is, what happens next? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=89.36s)]
*  The head of Hayat al-Tahrir al-Sham, that's the rebel group that led the offensive, told [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  me that there's a big focus on preserving the government infrastructure and institutions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=99.24s)]
*  Times reporter Raja Abdul Rahim has also been covering the collapse of the Syrian regime. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  It's actually a message that he has continued to give in his public statements to rebel [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=111.0s)]
*  fighters throughout the offensive, telling them not to destroy public property and public [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=116.68s)]
*  institutions and to preserve them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=122.04s)]
*  He said that these would come under the oversight of the current prime minister until there [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=125.32s)]
*  was some kind of transition. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=130.36s)]
*  There's definitely a focus at this point of continuity, but what remains to be seen is [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=134.04s)]
*  what the changes will be. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=140.52s)]
*  As of Sunday, Assad and his family have been granted political asylum in Russia, a longtime [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  ally. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  And experts warn that if the rebels aren't able to stabilize what's left of the government [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  in Syria, there could be a chaotic power struggle between the tangle of countries and groups [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=155.36s)]
*  with interests there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=160.4s)]
*  In the last 36 hours, the Turkish military fired on Kurdish forces in the north of Syria. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=162.36s)]
*  The U.S. carried out airstrikes against dozens of Islamic State camps, and Israeli ground [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=168.24s)]
*  forces took control of a handful of military posts that had been abandoned by Syrian troops. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=173.0s)]
*  I understand that on day one you're going to be signing a flurry of executive orders. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=186.8s)]
*  Can you give me just what are the top ones people should know about? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=191.08s)]
*  A lot of it will have to do with economics. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=194.28s)]
*  A lot's going to have to do with energy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=196.0s)]
*  A lot's going to do with having to do with the border. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=197.76s)]
*  In his first broadcast TV interview since the presidential election, Donald Trump previewed [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=201.48s)]
*  an aggressive opening to his second term in office. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=206.16s)]
*  Speaking to NBC's Meet the Press, he vowed to try and end birthright citizenship, the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  constitutional guarantee that anyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=214.2s)]
*  And Trump doubled down on his plans for the mass deportation of millions of undocumented [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=218.16s)]
*  saying that effort would also round up people with the right to be in the country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  People, the estimated four million families in America who have mixed immigration status. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  So I'm talking about parents who might be here illegally, but the kids are here legally. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  Your border czar Tom Homan said they can be deported together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=237.72s)]
*  Is that the plan? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=240.64s)]
*  Well, that way you keep the... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=241.48s)]
*  Well, I don't want to be breaking up families. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=243.16s)]
*  So the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  In the interview, the president-elect also said that on his first day in office, he'll [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  pardon the hundreds of people charged with participating in the January 6th riot. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=255.2s)]
*  And Trump said that members of the bipartisan House committee that investigated that attack, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  including Liz Cheney and Benny Thompson, should face criminal charges. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=264.8s)]
*  In a statement responding to the comments, Cheney said there would be no legal basis [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=269.44s)]
*  to pursue charges and that Trump was continuing his, quote, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=277.64s)]
*  In South Korea, President Yoon Suk-yul has survived an impeachment vote as the fallout [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=291.36s)]
*  from his short-lived declaration of martial law continues. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=296.52s)]
*  On Saturday, lawmakers tried to impeach Yoon in the same assembly hall where a chaotic [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=300.4s)]
*  scene played out last week when hundreds of soldiers had tried to seize the building [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=305.48s)]
*  on his orders. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=309.8s)]
*  But members of his political party boycotted the impeachment proceedings, with nearly all [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=311.76s)]
*  of them walking out before the vote. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  Yoon's political and legal troubles aren't over yet, though. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  Officials are now investigating whether his martial law order amounted to leading an insurrection. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=322.16s)]
*  And today, the country's justice ministry barred him from leaving South Korea. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, protests against Yoon in the country's capital over the weekend were the largest [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=331.8s)]
*  yet, and many demonstrators say they plan to keep pushing for his ouster. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=336.68s)]
*  The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that, starting next week, it will begin testing [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=348.24s)]
*  the nation's milk supply for the bird flu virus known as H5N1. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=352.76000000000005s)]
*  The move comes nearly a year after the virus first began circulating through dairy cattle [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=357.68s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=361.76s)]
*  It's been detected in 15 states, but until now, testing has been voluntary, leaving federal [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=362.76s)]
*  officials in the dark about exactly how far the virus may have spread. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=368.88s)]
*  And experts say that widespread testing is long overdue. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=373.2s)]
*  Pasteurized milk is safe from the virus, and there have been no known cases of illness [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=377.48s)]
*  from drinking raw milk. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=381.12s)]
*  But dozens of farm workers who handle cattle have become infected. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=383.04s)]
*  Some may have gotten sick after getting contaminated milk in their eyes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=387.0s)]
*  While the virus doesn't transfer easily among humans, scientists say every untreated infection [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=390.88s)]
*  raises the possibility that it could get better at spreading. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=395.88s)]
*  And finally. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=407.2s)]
*  Hi, my name's Emma. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=408.2s)]
*  I've come all the way from London with my best friend Sophie so that we could see the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=409.2s)]
*  last night. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=413.08s)]
*  Taylor just means everything to me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=414.84s)]
*  Her lyrics, her ethos, her music. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=417.12s)]
*  And we've even been out for Taylor Swift tattoos today. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=419.52s)]
*  Last night, tens of thousands of Swifties descended on downtown Vancouver for the final [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=422.64s)]
*  night of Taylor Swift's Marathon Tour. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=427.68s)]
*  Welcome to the Eras Tour! [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=430.4s)]
*  After almost two years and 149 sold out shows, it was the end of the Eras. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=433.52s)]
*  And the Times has learned just how lucrative the global phenomenon was. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  The tickets alone brought in nearly $2.1 billion, double the ticket sales of any other concert [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=442.68s)]
*  tour in history. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=448.04s)]
*  That doesn't even include resale tickets or the mountains of merch that her fans scooped [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=449.8s)]
*  up. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=454.16s)]
*  For Swift, it's the end of a five-continent whirlwind that she spent months training for. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=455.2s)]
*  It included a cardio workout that some devoted fans even tried to match, singing her entire [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=460.0s)]
*  set list of about 40 songs while running on a treadmill. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=465.08s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=472.68s)]
*  Today on The Daily. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=473.96s)]
*  A deeper look at how Syria's president lost his grip on power. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=475.52s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=479.56s)]
*  I'm Megan Specia. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=484.56s)]
*  The headlines will be back tomorrow with Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NheQnSWGGDE&t=485.8s)]
