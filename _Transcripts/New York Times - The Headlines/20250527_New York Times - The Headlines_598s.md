# Senate Takes On Trump Bill, How AI Is Changing Work, Stitch Is Disney’s ‘Rebel’ Star | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Will Jarvis in for Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=4.84s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, May 27th. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=7.44s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  We are mortgaging our children's future. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=15.36s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=16.96s)]
*  It's immoral. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=17.96s)]
*  It has to stop. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=18.96s)]
*  In Washington, President Trump's major domestic policy agenda, the so-called Big Beautiful [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=19.96s)]
*  is facing pushback in the Senate after narrowly being passed by the House last week. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=25.64s)]
*  Its fate could now be determined by a handful of Republican lawmakers, some of whom are [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=30.6s)]
*  pushing for the bill to include more cuts to federal spending. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=34.92s)]
*  How many other Republican senators do you think share your concerns and are willing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  to work to make major changes to this bill? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=43.84s)]
*  I think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about spending [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  reduction and reducing the deficit. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=51.28s)]
*  In an interview on CNN, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin echoed a concern that almost [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=53.32s)]
*  derailed the bill in the House, that the legislation would significantly add to the federal deficit. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  The bill includes major cuts to Medicaid and other welfare programs, but also expands tax [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=63.82s)]
*  cuts and boosts military spending. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=68.56s)]
*  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky also criticized the bill, calling it, quote, not a serious [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=71.48s)]
*  proposal. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=76.32s)]
*  He said Republicans should make more cuts to Medicaid, Social Security, and food assistance [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=77.56s)]
*  programs to drive down the national debt. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=82.12s)]
*  That could set up a clash not only with Democrats in the Senate, but with some of their Republican [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=84.92s)]
*  colleagues who have been trying to back away from cutting popular programs like Medicaid. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=89.28s)]
*  The Senate Majority Leader John Thune said there will be changes to the bill passed by [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=93.72s)]
*  the House, but he said how long it takes to hash that out is an open question. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Times has been looking into what the legislation could mean for immigrant [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  families. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  As it currently stands, the bill would cut some health benefits and a tax credit from [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=110.72s)]
*  people without permanent legal status, including refugees and those who've been granted asylum. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=115.12s)]
*  Republicans say the goal is to remove incentives for people trying to immigrate, even though [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=121.48s)]
*  unauthorized migrants generally don't get federal benefits. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=125.4s)]
*  But immigration experts and advocates say the changes will largely be felt by American [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=129.16s)]
*  children. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=133.52s)]
*  That's because there are millions of kids with U.S. citizenship who have at least one [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=134.52s)]
*  parent who isn't a citizen. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=138.64s)]
*  Currently kids can get many benefits even if their parents don't have full legal status, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=141.28s)]
*  but under the new legislation, that could change. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=145.4s)]
*  And more broadly, experts tell the Times that the effort to target immigrants' benefits [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=148.24s)]
*  could create a chilling effect and make people hesitant to seek out support over fears that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=152.76s)]
*  their family members could be deported. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=157.68s)]
*  A series of deadly aerial attacks in Ukraine has prompted President Trump to issue a sharp [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=159.48s)]
*  and rare criticism of Russia's president. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  On Saturday and Sunday, a swarm of long-range drones, along with missile barrages, killed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=175.76s)]
*  at least 12 people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Then before dawn yesterday, Russia launched hundreds more armed drones and more missiles. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=183.2s)]
*  I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=188.6s)]
*  I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him, but he's sending rockets [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=190.48s)]
*  into cities and killing people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=195.28s)]
*  And I don't like it at all. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=197.48s)]
*  Amid the surge of violence, President Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=200.0s)]
*  quote gone absolutely crazy and that he was needlessly killing a lot of people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=204.24s)]
*  But the intense new round of attacks comes as the U.S., which has supplied much of Ukraine's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  has been pulling back, both militarily and diplomatically. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=215.28s)]
*  Since taking office, Trump has not approved any new military aid to Ukraine, or said if [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=219.24s)]
*  he'll spend the billions of dollars that Congress has already approved for new weapons [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=223.64s)]
*  shipments. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=227.52s)]
*  He's also refused to join Europe in putting new sanctions on Russia. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=228.68s)]
*  And last week, he said that Russia and Ukraine would have to find a solution to the war themselves, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=232.44s)]
*  even though he'd previously promised he could end the conflict in 24 hours. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=237.2s)]
*  In response to Trump's rebuke, Putin's spokesman downplayed the sharp comments, calling them [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=242.06s)]
*  a quote emotional reaction. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=246.86s)]
*  In Gaza, an effort to completely overhaul how Palestinians get humanitarian aid is moving [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  forward, even as controversy around the project has flared. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=260.16s)]
*  Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, aid has been handed out by the UN and other established [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=264.26s)]
*  humanitarian groups at hundreds of sites across the territory. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=269.02s)]
*  Now, Israel is turning over the distribution of aid to a new and untested group, the Gaza [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=272.7s)]
*  Humanitarian Foundation, that is set to distribute aid at just a few sites in the south. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=278.14s)]
*  The group had claimed to be independent and neutral, though over the weekend, the Foundation's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=283.85999999999996s)]
*  executive director resigned after the Times and other outlets reported that it has deep [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=288.12s)]
*  connections to Israel. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=292.94s)]
*  The means by which food is distributed in Gaza is hugely important. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=294.9s)]
*  It comes after an 80-day blockade by Israel on food and fuel that brought the territory, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  according to aid agencies and other monitors, to the brink of starvation and famine. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=307.5s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley is the Times Jerusalem bureau chief. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  He says supporters of the plan, including the Israeli and US governments, say it will [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=317.12s)]
*  prevent Hamas from taking control of humanitarian aid and stockpiling it for itself. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=321.46s)]
*  But the new strategy to distribute aid has also set off widespread concerns. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=326.38s)]
*  Critics are very wary of the plan for a number of reasons, including the fact that it will [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=331.58s)]
*  force Palestinian civilians to cross Israeli military lines in order to find food, and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=336.08s)]
*  that could put them at risk of being detained or perhaps even shot in some cases. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=343.14s)]
*  And in addition, there are fears that this could be part of some broader Israeli plan [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=349.14s)]
*  to displace civilians from northern Gaza to southern Gaza, because if the only place where [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=353.86s)]
*  they can find food, at least initially under this plan, is in the south, then they will [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=359.8s)]
*  have to move themselves to the southern end of Gaza in order to avoid starvation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  At offices across the country, the rise of artificial intelligence hasn't, at least [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=370.58s)]
*  for the moment, kicked off the mass layoffs that some people worried were imminent. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=383.46s)]
*  But the Times has been tracking how AI is transforming the way people do their jobs, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  particularly in one of the fields where it's been most widely adopted, coding. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=392.53999999999996s)]
*  At Google, the company says 30% of its code is now suggested by AI before being accepted [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=397.34s)]
*  by developers. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=402.85999999999996s)]
*  At Shopify, using AI is now a baseline expectation for engineers. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=403.85999999999996s)]
*  And at Amazon, a new AI tool is generating large portions of a computer program completely [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=408.9s)]
*  on its own. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  Amazon's CEO said that working faster is crucial for staying ahead of the competition, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  and that just in terms of upgrading old software, AI tools have saved the equivalent of 4500 [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=420.7s)]
*  years of developers' work. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=426.38000000000005s)]
*  But software engineers the Times talked to have described a profound change in the quality [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=428.14000000000004s)]
*  of their work, saying their jobs have become more routine and less thoughtful, and also [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  much faster-paced. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  Three Amazon engineers said that as the company leaned into AI, it raised output goals for [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  the human employees, and became less forgiving about deadlines. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=444.82000000000005s)]
*  One labor expert told the Times that overall, the shift for workers is mirroring what happened [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=448.70000000000005s)]
*  in the 19th and 20th centuries, when artisanal crafts were replaced by factory assembly lines. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=453.5s)]
*  And finally, the Hollywood box office seems to be bouncing back. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=469.86s)]
*  Ever since the pandemic, people have largely been streaming at home instead of heading [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=474.58s)]
*  to theaters. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=478.34s)]
*  But a slew of new movies, released leading up to Memorial Day weekend, are turning the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=479.5s)]
*  tide. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=483.5s)]
*  What exactly is your plan? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=484.5s)]
*  Looking at the top movies in the country, box office revenue is up almost $100 million [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=488.78s)]
*  dollars from last year. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=493.09999999999997s)]
*  Analysts say theaters need a handful of big studio films to get people in the door, and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=494.9s)]
*  enough variety to keep them coming back. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=499.41999999999996s)]
*  That could finally be happening. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=502.02s)]
*  Right now in theaters, there's the final installment of the Mission Impossible franchise, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=504.65999999999997s)]
*  the superhero flick Thunderbolts, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=509.0s)]
*  and the top performer, a live-action remake of Lilo and Stitch, one of the most successful [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ph1qsQPIzo&t=515.0s)]
