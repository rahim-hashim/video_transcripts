# How Car Tariffs Will Hit Consumers, and a Fight Over Funding Elmo
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Thursday, March 27th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  This is very exciting. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=13.68s)]
*  So we're signing a executive order today that's going to lead to tremendous growth [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=14.76s)]
*  in the automobile industry. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  President Trump has announced a new round of tariffs, saying he will impose a 25% surcharge [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=24.44s)]
*  on imported cars and car parts starting next week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=29.92s)]
*  Right now, a car would be made here, sent to Canada, sent to Mexico, sent all over the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=34.2s)]
*  place. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Trump said the tariffs are meant to force car companies to dismantle their global supply [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  chains and move all of their manufacturing to the U.S. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=45.24s)]
*  It's really hard to overstate the extent to which these tariffs will impact not only automakers [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=49.24s)]
*  and their profits, but entire economies of countries across the world and consumers [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=55.2s)]
*  across the U.S. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  River Akira-Davis is a Times economics reporter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=62.92s)]
*  She says it would cost carmakers billions of dollars to relocate their operations, a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=65.88s)]
*  move that could devastate the countries where a lot of that work happens now, like Canada [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=70.92s)]
*  and Mexico. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=75.0s)]
*  And at least in the short term, all of the upheaval and the tariffs themselves will likely [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=76.0s)]
*  lead to higher price tags for anyone shopping for a car. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=81.04s)]
*  In the months ahead, analysts expect consumers in the U.S. to be paying potentially thousands [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=84.84s)]
*  of dollars more for cars. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=90.68s)]
*  And that's not only for foreign brands, it's also for American brands as well that rely [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  on importing parts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=97.92s)]
*  In fact, I've already spoken to car dealers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=100.16s)]
*  Most recently, I spoke with a car dealer in Maine who said that already his business is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=103.0s)]
*  being significantly impacted because consumers are essentially panic buying vehicles in anticipation [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=108.12s)]
*  of future price hikes that would be caused by these tariffs. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=114.24s)]
*  At the Capitol yesterday, things got heated in two separate hearings. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=126.6s)]
*  It is completely outrageous to me that administration officials come before us today with no acceptance [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=130.6s)]
*  of responsibility. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  Excuse after excuse after excuse. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=139.48s)]
*  In the House Intelligence Committee, Trump administration officials faced another day [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=142.0s)]
*  of grilling about the Signal group chat, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=146.06s)]
*  of an airstrike that was about to be carried out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=151.0s)]
*  This is not OK. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  Communicating these sorts of things in Signal is not OK. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=155.32s)]
*  Targets, times, those kinds of things are absolutely classified and we all know it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=158.52s)]
*  Democrats argued the messages were vulnerable to interception by America's adversaries [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=165.16s)]
*  and could have endangered American troops if the details fell into the wrong hands. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  But when questioned, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said the conversation [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=173.84s)]
*  was not a security breach. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Ideally these conversations occur in person. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=180.12s)]
*  However, at times fast moving coordination of an unclassified nature is necessary where [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  in person conversation is not an option. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=188.24s)]
*  On their part, most Republican lawmakers followed the lead set by President Trump of downplaying [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  the incident and denying its seriousness. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=197.04s)]
*  And in the other hearing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=200.48s)]
*  For far too long, federal taxpayers have been forced to fund biased news. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=201.48s)]
*  This needs to come to an end and it needs to come to an end now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  Republicans led by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene laced into the leaders of PBS [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  and NPR. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=216.48s)]
*  Greene accused the public media networks, which serve news and educational content to tens [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  of millions of Americans, of promoting propaganda and indoctrinating children with LGBTQ programming. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=222.48s)]
*  PBS is one of the founders of the trans child abuse industry, all while taking taxpayer [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=229.16s)]
*  money. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=238.0s)]
*  Democrats in the hearing, though, mocked the idea of questioning the motives of classic [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=239.88s)]
*  children's programs on PBS like Arthur or Sesame Street. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=243.56s)]
*  The American people want to know is Elmo now or has he ever been a member of the Communist [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=247.44s)]
*  Party of the United States? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=253.4s)]
*  Over the course of the hearing, the public media executives defended their work and its [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=255.42s)]
*  value to the public. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=259.32s)]
*  Though NPR's chief executive said she regretted past social media posts she'd made criticizing [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=261.08s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=266.6s)]
*  She also said the network should have more aggressively covered the story of Hunter Biden's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=268.08s)]
*  laptop, a story right wing media covered extensively, claiming the laptop held proof of corruption [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=271.84s)]
*  involving the Biden family. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=277.04s)]
*  The Department of Health and Human Services has abruptly canceled more than 12 billion [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=287.12s)]
*  dollars in grants that states were using for a range of urgent health issues, from [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=291.32s)]
*  addiction treatment to tracking infectious diseases. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=296.24s)]
*  The funds were originally allocated during the covid-19 pandemic, but starting last year, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=299.36s)]
*  states were allowed to put any remaining money toward other health issues. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  In Texas, for example, the grants were supporting the state's response to the ongoing measles [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=308.72s)]
*  outbreak there. But this week, state health departments began getting notices the funds [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=313.32000000000005s)]
*  were terminated, effective immediately, and that all work should stop. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=318.3s)]
*  A statement from the Department of Health and Human Services said, quote, The covid-19 [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=323.0s)]
*  pandemic is over and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=332.62s)]
*  Some state health officials tell the Times they were always planning for the funds to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=336.86s)]
*  expire, but the abruptness of the decision has caused chaos. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=340.86s)]
*  There are half finished projects that cost millions of dollars that may now never be [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=344.98s)]
*  completed. One health official said, quote, This is just like throwing money out the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=348.74s)]
*  window. It's a total waste. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=353.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Trump administration has also canceled funding for dozens of studies [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=357.54s)]
*  seeking new vaccines and treatments for covid-19 and other pathogens that may cause [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=361.94s)]
*  future pandemics. The goal of the projects was to have vaccines and drugs ready to go [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=367.3s)]
*  if a new pandemic hit rather than spending months having to develop them from scratch. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=372.38s)]
*  In Massachusetts, surveillance footage shows immigration officers arresting another [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=382.18s)]
*  university student who participated in pro-Palestinian activism. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=390.66s)]
*  In the video captured earlier this week, agents approach Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=394.94s)]
*  who's in the U.S. on a student visa, attending Tufts University. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=400.56s)]
*  Where are the police? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=403.74s)]
*  You don't look like it. Why are you hiding your faces? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=404.74s)]
*  Plane clothes officers in masks then detain Ozturk on the sidewalk outside her home while [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=408.3s)]
*  bystanders ask what's happening. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  She was then handcuffed and driven away in an unmarked car. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  In a statement, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Ozturk had [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=419.58s)]
*  acted in support of Hamas and said that that was grounds for revoking her visa. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=423.85999999999996s)]
*  She wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper last year asking Tufts to, quote, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=429.02s)]
*  acknowledge the Palestinian genocide. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=432.82s)]
*  The Trump administration has said it can start deportation proceedings against any non-citizen [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=435.46s)]
*  that it's deemed a threat to U.S. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=440.78s)]
*  foreign policy interests, even if they're in the country legally. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=442.41999999999996s)]
*  It made a similar claim earlier this month when it detained Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  The Massachusetts attorney general called Ozturk's arrest disturbing, saying, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  this isn't public safety, it's intimidation that will and should be closely scrutinized in court. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=456.94s)]
*  And finally, scientists are saying goodbye to a spacecraft that changed how we understand the universe. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=462.9s)]
*  Gaia was launched back in 2013. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=479.26s)]
*  It's a powerful space telescope that was sent up to build a precise three-dimensional map of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=481.94s)]
*  billions of stars. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=487.14s)]
*  In all the data that it gathered, astronomers found hints of new planets and black holes, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=489.02s)]
*  including the black hole that's the closest known one to Earth. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  Scientists also used data from Gaia to help measure how fast the universe is expanding. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=498.74s)]
*  After more than a decade of documenting space, the telescope closed its eyes to starlight this [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=504.62s)]
*  January. It's low on fuel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=510.34s)]
*  And today, mission specialists will switch it off and set it to go orbit around the sun. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=513.06s)]
*  Essentially sending it to that big graveyard in the sky for spacecraft. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=518.5s)]
*  Scientists who've worked on the project say while they're sad to see Gaia go, it's not actually the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=522.78s)]
*  end of their work. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfhH0dBPxyE&t=527.74s)]
