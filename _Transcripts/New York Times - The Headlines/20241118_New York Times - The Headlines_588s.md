# Biden’s Big Shift on Ukraine, and Neo-Nazi Marchers Shock Ohio
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, November [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=0.0s)]
*  18th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=7.28s)]
*  President Biden has crossed what used to be a red line in the US's support of Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=14.76s)]
*  He's authorized Ukraine to fire American supplied long range missiles inside Russia. It marks [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  a major policy shift for the president. Even as the US has poured billions of dollars of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=27.14s)]
*  military aid into Ukraine, Biden repeatedly hesitated when it came to helping Ukraine [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=32.38s)]
*  go on the offensive. He's been worried about provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=37.54s)]
*  into a wider war. But with North Korean troops now fighting in Western Russia to take back [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=41.9s)]
*  land that Ukraine seized, Biden changed course. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  The main reason for the change was a decision that was taken by Russia to introduce North [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=51.86s)]
*  Korean soldiers into the fight. This was such a escalation in the war against Ukraine that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=57.62s)]
*  the administration felt that it needed to respond. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=64.22s)]
*  Adam Entus covers national security for the Times. He says the policy change has divided [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=68.3s)]
*  Biden's advisors. Some still fear retaliation from Putin. Some think the threat is overblown. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  Overall, he says that officials don't expect that green lighting the long range weapons [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=80.25999999999999s)]
*  will fundamentally alter the course of the war, but it will send a message. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=85.22s)]
*  The sort of strategic message is really to the North Koreans. And that message is your [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  troops are vulnerable. There is a price, a significant price that you're going to pay [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=96.18s)]
*  for your decision to involve your forces in this conflict. And the takeaway that they [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=101.18s)]
*  want the North Koreans to take from this is don't send any more of them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=106.34s)]
*  Biden's policy shift comes as the administration is in a race against time to bolster Ukraine [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=114.7s)]
*  before Donald Trump takes office. Trump has vowed to limit further support to Ukraine [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=120.62s)]
*  and said the war needs to end quickly. He said very little about how he would do that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  But Vice President elect J.D. Vance has outlined a plan that would allow Russia to keep the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=130.86s)]
*  Ukrainian territory that its forces have seized. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=135.94s)]
*  A few days ago, Donald Trump's transition team got some news that surprised them. They [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=149.3s)]
*  learned that Pete Hegseth, the Fox News personality who Trump picked to be his secretary of defense, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=154.38s)]
*  had entered into a financial settlement with a woman who claimed he sexually assaulted [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=160.5s)]
*  her in 2017. According to a memo sent to the Trump team by a person claiming to be [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=164.66s)]
*  a friend of the woman, the woman said that Hegseth raped her and that she went to the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=170.22s)]
*  hospital where they collected evidence for a rape kit. Local police in Monterey, California, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=174.66s)]
*  said an official complaint was made a few days later, but that charges were never filed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  Hegseth's lawyers say he vigorously denies the allegation and that he only paid the settlement [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=185.62s)]
*  because he was worried about being blackmailed. Because the settlement was confidential, it [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=191.02s)]
*  didn't come up as part of the vetting process when Hegseth was being considered to lead [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=196.02s)]
*  the Pentagon. The Times has learned that since the news came out, Trump told his advisors [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=200.02s)]
*  he would still stand by his pick. Trump himself was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=205.78s)]
*  case and has been supportive of other men who face similar accusations. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=211.34s)]
*  The new scrutiny of Hegseth comes as Trump has continued to name key players for his [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=218.5s)]
*  next administration at breakneck speed. He's largely been making his decisions from the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=222.94s)]
*  tea room at Mar-a-Lago. Aides flip through slideshows of potential picks on huge screens [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=228.62s)]
*  and play clips of their TV appearances, a crucial factor for anyone Trump is considering. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=234.82s)]
*  This weekend, Trump announced that Chris Wright, the head of a fracking company, is his pick [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=241.22s)]
*  for Secretary of Energy. Wright has no government experience, but caught Trump's eye in part [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=246.18s)]
*  because of his appearances on Fox News. And last night, Trump announced that Brendan Carr [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=251.78s)]
*  will head up the Federal Communications Commission. Carr is currently a member of the FCC's board, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=256.74s)]
*  and he's expected to use his new leadership role to wield the commission as a political [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=262.54s)]
*  tool for Trump. Going after big tech companies he's claimed are biased against conservatives [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=267.02s)]
*  and potentially punishing TV networks who air coverage that's critical of the president-elect. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=273.5s)]
*  In Columbus, Ohio this weekend, a small group of people marched through the city carrying [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=285.02s)]
*  Nazi flags and shouting about white power through a bullhorn. There were only about [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  a dozen marchers and no arrests were made, but the Anti-Defamation League says it fits [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  a recent pattern of white supremacist incidents across the country. There have been hundreds [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=300.16s)]
*  in the last 18 months, including one earlier this month in Michigan, where Nazi demonstrators [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=305.36s)]
*  stood outside of a community theater performance of the Diary of Anne Frank. The incidents [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  tend to be small and unannounced to avoid drawing counter-protests. And the vice president [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=316.72s)]
*  of the ADL said the hate groups organize for maximum shock value, especially on social [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=322.48s)]
*  media, where the visuals spread quickly. He told the Times, quote, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=328.24s)]
*  The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the killing of Sonia Massey, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=349.24s)]
*  the black woman who was shot and killed in her home in Illinois this summer by a sheriff's deputy [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=353.96s)]
*  after she called 911. The DOJ says it has, quote, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=359.12s)]
*  Massey had a history of mental health issues and the day before the shooting, her mother called [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=370.47999999999996s)]
*  police to say she was having a breakdown and she begged police not to hurt her daughter. Then Massey [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=375.67999999999995s)]
*  herself called police to say she thought there was someone prowling outside her house. Deputy [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=381.56s)]
*  Sean Grayson, who is white, responded to the call. Body camera footage showed him shooting Massey [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=386.36s)]
*  after an exchange in her kitchen where he asked her to put down a pot of hot water. Grayson was [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=391.88s)]
*  fired from the force and charged with murder. He's pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=397.8s)]
*  has asked the sheriff's office to show how it trains and responds to people experiencing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=403.48s)]
*  behavioral health crises and to provide data about the race of people that its officers have used [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=408.28s)]
*  force against. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=413.55999999999995s)]
*  Starting at 9 p.m. tonight, anyone in the U.S. turning on the TV, the radio or checking social media, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=420.84s)]
*  I don't fight for power. It's probably going to hear one thing. I fight the free road for men like them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=430.88s)]
*  The Gladiator 2 trailer is going to be running simultaneously on 4000 TV networks, radio stations [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=438.0s)]
*  and digital platforms as Paramount Pictures goes all out on trying to promote the new film. The [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=445.28s)]
*  strategy is what's known as a roadblock. That's the marketing term for buying up so much airtime [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=451.44s)]
*  and the fact that for a brief moment, one single product or film is everywhere you look. The Gladiator 2 [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=457.16s)]
*  roadblock could be one of the biggest ever and the stunt is a sign of how far big studios feel they [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=463.48s)]
*  now have to go to capture people's attention since viewing habits are so fractured. The studios are [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=469.72s)]
*  in fierce competition with streaming services, video games and TikTok. Box office sales are down [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  about 11% from last year and still down 25% since before the pandemic. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=482.04s)]
*  And finally, in football, kicking a field goal from halfway down the field used to be a last [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=495.24s)]
*  ditch act of desperation because it was likely to fall short and fail. This field goal from 54. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  But now, 50-yard field goals are becoming more common. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=507.32s)]
*  There were at least three just this weekend and the success rate on these far away kicks has [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=514.76s)]
*  doubled since the 1980s. Boswell drives it and he connects. One former NFL kicker tells the times [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=520.12s)]
*  that kickers have just gotten better. Young players now specialize in kicking and train year round [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=528.36s)]
*  where they used to only practice during football season and maybe took time off to play other [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=534.92s)]
*  sports too. Their success is changing how football is played. More teams are going for the 50-plus [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=538.92s)]
*  yard field goal earlier in the game, not just in the final two minutes when a team really needs to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  score. It's gotten to the point that there's even chatter in the NFL about whether they should make [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=551.0799999999999s)]
*  things harder by moving the goal posts closer together. Those are the headlines. Today on the [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  Daily, a deeper look at Donald Trump's pick for attorney general Matt Gaetz and what it reveals [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=564.68s)]
*  about Trump's promise for retribution. That's next in the New York Times audio app or you can [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=570.68s)]
*  listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj05EvWQ8NY&t=576.3599999999999s)]
