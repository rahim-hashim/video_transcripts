# Early Voting Grows Among Republicans, and a Lithium Trove in Arkansas
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=5.04s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, October 22nd. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=6.04s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=8.76s)]
*  With two weeks to go until Election Day, more than 15 million Americans have already voted. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=13.82s)]
*  And many states are setting records. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=20.04s)]
*  Georgia, Louisiana, and even North Carolina, which is still reeling from Hurricane Helene, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=22.28s)]
*  have all had record turnout. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=28.08s)]
*  It's a sign that the huge boost in early voting that came with the pandemic is sticking around. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=30.639999999999997s)]
*  Americans are embracing early voting in massive numbers. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=36.36s)]
*  It's no longer just Election Day, but it's election season. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=39.68s)]
*  Nick Korsanidi is covering the election for the Times. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=43.64s)]
*  Well, it's still way too early to try and glean any partisan advantage or a look at [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=46.12s)]
*  who's winning through the early vote data that we have so far. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=51.12s)]
*  We are seeing one key trend emerge, and that's that more Republicans are choosing to vote early. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=54.52s)]
*  When that comes to mail voting, Democrats are still dominating in the states where we [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=60.88s)]
*  have party registration data. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=64.88s)]
*  But Republicans are also making gains there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=66.9s)]
*  So if you were to look at Pennsylvania, you could see that in the 2020 election, Republicans [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=69.84s)]
*  only cast about 23% of the total votes by mail. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=74.26s)]
*  This year so far, they're about 27%. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=78.58000000000001s)]
*  That's important for helping campaigns know which votes are banked and which voters they [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=81.24s)]
*  still need to target. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  Both the Harris and Trump campaigns are pushing their supporters to vote early this year, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=90.28s)]
*  though Donald Trump has undermined that message at Times, criticizing mail-in voting and spreading [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  misinformation that it's rigged. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=100.72s)]
*  At events in North Carolina yesterday, Trump said he hadn't seen evidence of cheating yet [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=103.28s)]
*  this year, but repeated his unfounded claims that Democrats are trying to. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=108.0s)]
*  He asked the chairman of the Republican National Committee about it on stage. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=113.12s)]
*  He's going to stop the cheating. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=116.44s)]
*  How are you doing? Are they cheating, Michael? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  They're trying, but they're not going to get away with it, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=120.52s)]
*  He said he said no. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=124.36s)]
*  Trump's allies have also filed a flurry of lawsuits challenging voting rules and practices [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=126.92s)]
*  around the country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=132.16s)]
*  That suggests a broader effort to lay the groundwork to potentially challenge the election [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=133.92s)]
*  results in November. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=138.0s)]
*  More than a year into the war in Gaza, the Israeli military has now killed most of Hamas's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=146.98s)]
*  top commanders, decimated rank-and-file fighters, and destroyed many of the group's stockpiles. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  But Hamas is still fighting back, and it's using guerrilla tactics to avoid defeat. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=159.08s)]
*  Much of the group's vast tunnel network remains intact, allowing Hamas fighters to emerge [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=164.6s)]
*  and booby-trap buildings or set roadside bombs. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=169.76s)]
*  They've also been refilling their arsenal by gathering up unexploded Israeli munitions [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=173.44s)]
*  and turning them into improvised explosives. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=178.4s)]
*  And even though Israel killed the group's leader, Yaya Sinwar, last week, its fighters [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=181.46s)]
*  have adapted to making decisions locally and independently. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=185.94s)]
*  Sinwar, for example, hadn't had much direct control over militants in northern Gaza for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=189.78s)]
*  almost a year. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=195.02s)]
*  In that part of the territory, Israel has been carrying out intense bombardments and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  has issued evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people in the past few weeks. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=201.66s)]
*  The escalation there comes as one former Israeli general has been pushing a dramatic proposal [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=207.3s)]
*  for northern Gaza. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=212.94s)]
*  He wants the Israeli government to cut off all food and water to the region. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=214.82s)]
*  He says it would force Hamas fighters to either, quote, surrender or to die of starvation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=219.26s)]
*  The plan has gotten some support in the Israeli government, though human rights advocates [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  say it would threaten the welfare of civilians and violate international law. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  The memoir of Alexei Navalny, the pro-democracy Russian opposition leader who died in [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=240.2s)]
*  prison earlier this year, is being published today. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=244.78s)]
*  The book contains the journal entries he managed to write and smuggle out of prison. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=247.98s)]
*  His widow, Yulia Navalny, helped assemble them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=252.86s)]
*  In the entries, Navalny wrote that he knew Vladimir Putin might succeed in silencing him, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=255.78s)]
*  but that he was resigned to it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=260.9s)]
*  Navalny was the most prominent figure in the opposition movement. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=262.78s)]
*  And in his absence, Times reporter Valerie Hopkins says the movement has been struggling. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=266.3s)]
*  In the period after Navalny's death, all opposition-minded Russians were grieving not only for him, but [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=271.26s)]
*  for a democratic vision of Russia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=278.38s)]
*  But now, about half a year since his death, the opposition has actually never been more [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=281.62s)]
*  divided, it feels like. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=286.38s)]
*  Valerie says that tensions are high among the groups that oppose Putin, both Navalny's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=288.42s)]
*  team and others. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  The groups have been beset by infighting, you know, with accusations actually that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=294.98s)]
*  some progressive Russians have been violent against Navalny supporters, you know, just [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  after an investigation raising questions about where the Navalny team gets their funding [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=307.1s)]
*  and accusations that they are affiliated with potentially corrupt people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=314.94s)]
*  It's caused a lot of consternation and frustration and trust issues, frankly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=321.70000000000005s)]
*  So there are a lot of different disputes and visions for what a democratic Russia should [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=328.54s)]
*  look like and what are the compromises and political steps it's going to take to get [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=333.86s)]
*  there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=337.94000000000005s)]
*  But as that looks far off, it seems like the opposition has been more focused on fighting [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=339.22s)]
*  itself than the Kremlin. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=344.06s)]
*  Officials in Arkansas, along with federal researchers, have announced that they've [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  discovered a vast underground trove of lithium, the raw material that's critical for building [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  batteries like those used in electric vehicles. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=360.86s)]
*  They say there could be millions of tons of lithium under the state in brine reservoirs, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=364.18s)]
*  essentially huge deposits of salty water. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=368.94000000000005s)]
*  There may be even enough to meet all of the world's demand. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=372.26000000000005s)]
*  Currently, most lithium comes from Australia and South America, and the energy industry, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=375.58000000000004s)]
*  encouraged by the Biden administration, has been increasingly looking for domestic sources [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=380.82s)]
*  of the metal. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=385.38s)]
*  The question now is how to get the lithium out of the brine. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=386.8s)]
*  One method uses huge, lake-sized evaporation ponds, but there are efforts underway to develop [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=390.82s)]
*  new technology that will use filters and other tools to extract it more efficiently with [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=396.2s)]
*  a smaller environmental footprint. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=401.26s)]
*  Even before the huge deposit of Arkansas lithium was discovered, ExxonMobil had been drilling [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=403.72s)]
*  exploratory wells in the state. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=409.53999999999996s)]
*  It says that by 2030, it hopes to be extracting enough lithium a year from Arkansas to power [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=411.78s)]
*  a million electric vehicles. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=417.82s)]
*  And finally, even in places where the leaves don't change colors, you know it's officially [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=425.09999999999997s)]
*  fall when the Spirit Halloween opens. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=430.38s)]
*  The Halloween retail giant opens up more than 1,500 pop-up locations across the country [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  every year, taking over vacant spots and strip malls, selling costumes, fake blood, vampire [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=445.06s)]
*  fangs, and some truly terrifying animatronics that your neighbor inevitably buys. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=451.38s)]
*  Come November, the stores are gone again, before people even finish the candy corn. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  They're part of the massive and growing Halloween economy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=462.02s)]
*  This year, Americans are expected to spend more than $11 billion celebrating. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=466.98s)]
*  That amount has quadrupled over the last 20 years. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=470.98s)]
*  About $3.5 billion of that will go to candy, roughly the same amount to costumes, and even [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=474.82s)]
*  $500 million to Halloween greeting cards, which are apparently a thing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=479.86s)]
*  The CEO of Spirit Halloween says the Halloween boom is thanks in part to almost every age [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=485.74s)]
*  getting in on the holiday. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=491.3s)]
*  When he was growing up, he said you got to 12 and you stopped celebrating. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=493.34s)]
*  But now college students and adults are in on it too. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=497.38s)]
*  And this year, the company has announced it's set its sights on another holiday. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=500.94s)]
*  It's going to test a handful of Spirit Christmas shops across the Northeast. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=505.29999999999995s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=514.14s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a Times investigation into the health risks of marijuana, as more [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=515.76s)]
*  Americans use more potent forms of the drug more often. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=520.68s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TdIKrjydbo&t=525.2399999999999s)]
