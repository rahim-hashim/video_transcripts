# Trump’s New Charm Offensive, and a Drone Attack on Moscow
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, March [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=0.0s)]
*  11th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=7.32s)]
*  The House of Representatives may vote as soon as today on a stopgap funding measure to keep [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  the government running. Without it, the government will shut down Friday at midnight. The bill, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=19.48s)]
*  which was drafted by Republicans, calls for a slight decrease in overall spending, but increases the military budget by $6 billion. It's also got a half-billion dollar bump for immigration and customs enforcement, and a half-billion more for WIC, the federal program that provides groceries to low-income women and children. The GOP will need nearly every vote of their razor-thin majority to pass it, and previously, some conservative members have held out against this kind of spending bill. But now, the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=25.48s)]
*  president Trump is stepping up the pressure on them to push it through and avoid what could be a potentially embarrassing shutdown. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=55.48s)]
*  I've been talking to current lawmakers, former lawmakers, people who have been around Trump, working for him, just to get a sense of how does he kind of control House Republicans? How does he go about getting them to vote the way he needs them to vote? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=80.16s)]

*  And there is your closing bell on Wall Street. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=155.84s)]
*  And there is your closing bell on Wall Street. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=157.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tough one. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=159.84s)]
*  It was another ugly day for stocks on concerns over tariffs and a slowing economy. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=161.6s)]
*  All major stock indices are now below the levels they were when Donald Trump was inaugurated. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=165.72s)]
*  On Wall Street, stocks took a nosedive yesterday. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=172.24s)]
*  The markets had their steepest decline of the year. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=175.72s)]
*  It's part of what's been a weeks-long sell-off that's largely been driven by President Trump's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=178.8s)]
*  chaotic rollout of new tariffs. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Many business leaders supported Donald Trump in his run for president because they thought [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=186.12s)]
*  he would usher in this booming era of economic growth and were hoping Trump would be a president [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=191.88s)]
*  that was more sympathetic to their interests. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=197.44s)]
*  However, they've been frustrated not just by the tariffs themselves, but also by the uncertainty. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=199.96s)]
*  My colleague Tyler Pager has been covering the stock market fallout. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=206.28s)]
*  He says business leaders are warning that Trump's on-again, off-again approach to the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=209.74s)]
*  tariffs means they can't plan new hiring or investments. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=213.6s)]
*  Still, Trump has promised more tariffs. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=217.6s)]
*  He says they're intended to reset what he calls unfair trade relationships and that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=220.24s)]
*  they'll bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=224.76s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump pays close attention to the stock market and uses it as a barometer [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=227.64s)]
*  for his own success. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=232.04s)]
*  And so the question hanging over Washington and really the entire world is how long the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=234.32s)]
*  president is willing to stomach the pain of not just declining markets, but also negative [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=239.5s)]
*  media coverage. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=245.7s)]
*  And if he's willing to sustain that over time as these tariffs continue to inflict economic [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=247.34s)]
*  pain not just on Americans, but across the global economy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=252.58s)]
*  The Times has learned that a Justice Department attorney was fired after she refused to help [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=260.74s)]
*  restore gun rights to a prominent supporter of President Trump, Mel Gibson. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=265.94s)]
*  Gibson, the Hollywood actor, lost his right to own a firearm after a misdemeanor conviction [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=271.02s)]
*  for domestic violence in 2011. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=276.26s)]
*  About two weeks ago, the government attorney, Elizabeth Oyer, was put on a working group [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=278.78s)]
*  that was told to generate a list of people who the DOJ thought were good candidates to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=283.54s)]
*  have their gun rights restored. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=287.7s)]
*  Oyer told the Times that the list she helped put together was mostly people who had decades-old [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=290.38s)]
*  convictions and who they deemed unlikely to commit new crimes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=295.18s)]
*  But after they finalized the list, the Deputy Attorney General's Office told them to add [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=299.74s)]
*  Gibson's name. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=304.22s)]
*  They included a letter from Gibson's attorney asking to get his gun rights back, saying [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=305.98s)]
*  he'd made a number of successful movies and that Trump had tapped him to be what the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=310.42s)]
*  president called a special ambassador to Hollywood. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=314.74s)]
*  Oyer says she refused. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=318.7s)]
*  She had concerns about giving gun rights back to someone convicted of domestic abuse when [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=320.8s)]
*  she hadn't had time to fully consider the case. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=325.2s)]
*  Hours later, she got a call from a senior Justice Department official. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=328.8s)]
*  He told her Gibson had a personal relationship with President Trump, which should be enough [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=332.54s)]
*  to recommend restoring his rights. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  After she chose not to make that recommendation a second time, Oyer was fired and escorted [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  out of the office. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=345.66s)]
*  A DOJ official tells the Times that the firing had nothing to do with Gibson. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=347.26s)]
*  For the moment, the government hasn't released a list of anyone whose gun rights will be restored. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=352.06s)]
*  After weeks of relentless Russian drone attacks coming nearly every night, Ukraine launched [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=361.7s)]
*  its own bombardment against Moscow this morning. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=367.74s)]
*  The mayor of Moscow called it the largest attack on the city in the war so far. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=371.18s)]
*  Authorities say at least two people were killed and 14 were injured. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  The airports in Moscow were forced to close temporarily. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  The strikes came just hours before delegations from Kyiv and the United States are set to [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=383.16s)]
*  meet to discuss a possible path to ending the war. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=388.48s)]
*  The attack appeared intended to serve as a reminder that Ukraine still has the capacity [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=392.12s)]
*  to fight back against Russia. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=397.2s)]
*  In the Philippines today, the country's former president, Rodrigo Duterte, was arrested on [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  a warrant from the International Criminal Court for his brutal war on drugs. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=409.58s)]
*  When Duterte took office in 2016, he vowed to crack down violently on drug traffickers [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=414.82s)]
*  and drug users, saying he would be happy to, quote, slaughter anyone who was addicted. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=420.41999999999996s)]
*  According to human rights groups, roughly 30,000 people were executed by police forces [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  and vigilantes who Duterte empowered and encouraged. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=431.88s)]
*  The ICC said his actions amounted to crimes against humanity and it plans to fly him to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=435.84s)]
*  The Hague, where the court is based for a trial. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=440.84s)]
*  Family members of those who were killed in the crackdown applauded the arrest as a step [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=444.24s)]
*  towards justice. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=448.46s)]
*  So far, only a handful of people have been prosecuted in connection with the killings. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=450.12s)]
*  And finally, five years ago this week, offices, schools, and shops began to close down because [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=457.12s)]
*  of the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  Whole streets and neighborhoods went dark as people who could stay home did. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=471.68s)]
*  For researchers, the massive upheaval created conditions that never would have happened [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=476.41999999999996s)]
*  otherwise. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  They could suddenly see what it looked like when everything people took as normal stopped. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=482.5s)]
*  The Times has gathered some of the unexpected discoveries from that period. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=488.14000000000004s)]
*  One researcher found that high heels really are dangerous. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=493.56s)]
*  Up until 2020, the data showed roughly 16,000 people a year came into ERs with injuries [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=497.72s)]
*  like fractures or sprains from wearing heels. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=503.64000000000004s)]
*  When he looked at the data from 2020, those dropped by more than half. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=507.06s)]
*  In sports, studies showed that having fans at the game could be what really makes that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=512.12s)]
*  home field advantage. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=517.8s)]
*  Teams who played in their own empty stadiums, maybe with just cardboard cutouts watching [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=519.96s)]
*  them, had poorer performance without all that in-person support. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=524.84s)]
*  And in the animal world, researchers found that when humans aren't as active, animals [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=529.54s)]
*  began breeding more and traveling farther. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=534.46s)]
*  Sea turtles laid more eggs. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KTX-lXH5Gg&t=537.7s)]
