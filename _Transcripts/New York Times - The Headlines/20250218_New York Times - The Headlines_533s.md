# Plane Flips Over in Toronto, and Migrants Trapped in Panama Hotel
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=4.68s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, February 18th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=8.08s)]
*  This is an active investigation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  It's very early on. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=17.12s)]
*  It's really important that we do not speculate. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=18.66s)]
*  Authorities have released only a few details about the dramatic crash landing of a Delta [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=22.44s)]
*  Airlines flight in Toronto yesterday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=26.72s)]
*  The small jet was carrying 80 people on a flight from Minneapolis when it tried to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=29.38s)]
*  touch down amid heavy winds and drifting snow. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=33.4s)]
*  As it landed, it flipped upside down, losing its tail and a wing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=36.86s)]
*  No one was killed, but 18 people were injured. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=40.86s)]
*  There was no real indication of anything. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=43.5s)]
*  And then, yeah, we hit the ground and we were sideways. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  And then we were upside down, hanging like bats. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=48.58s)]
*  And then everybody was just like, get out, get out, get out. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=51.76s)]
*  We could smell like jet fuel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  And then we just crawled out the back of the airplane. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=56.5s)]
*  Passengers described having to climb out of the overturned plane as part of it burst into [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=59.7s)]
*  flames. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=63.7s)]
*  It's not clear what caused the crash, but it's the latest in a series of recent airline [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=64.7s)]
*  disasters that has travelers on edge, including a deadly crash in South Korea in December, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=69.7s)]
*  where a plane slid off the runway, and the midair collision near Washington last month [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=75.18s)]
*  between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=79.82s)]
*  As the Trump administration tries to carry out its plan for sweeping deportations, it's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=87.22s)]
*  faced a major challenge. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=93.38s)]
*  Many migrants in the U.S. come from countries it's not easy to deport them back to for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=95.82s)]
*  various reasons, like Afghanistan, Iran, or China. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=100.22s)]
*  Now, the administration has come up with an alternate plan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=104.22s)]
*  Send them to another country that is willing to take them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=108.16s)]
*  In the last week, the U.S. military has flown hundreds of people who come from countries [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=111.56s)]
*  in Asia, Africa, or the Middle East to Panama. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=116.16s)]
*  350 of them are now locked in a hotel in Panama City. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  They've been told they're going to be sent to a camp near the jungle, then on to their [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=124.6s)]
*  home countries. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=128.32s)]
*  The government of Panama is not allowing journalists to come and visit these migrants and interview [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  them, but they're visible from their windows of their hotel, and they were able to get [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=135.16s)]
*  their messages out through holding up signs, such as one woman did, holding up a piece [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=141.2s)]
*  of paper that read Afghan. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=147.2s)]
*  Another family of Iranian asylum seekers who had fled for America wrote in lipstick on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=150.5s)]
*  the window, help us. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  My colleague Hamed El-Aziz says the migrants have been stripped of their passports and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=161.16s)]
*  barred from talking to lawyers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=165.89999999999998s)]
*  He was able to speak with one woman who held onto her cell phone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=168.16s)]
*  My colleague and I were able to get a hold of one migrant in the hotel, an Iranian woman [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=171.32s)]
*  named Artemis Ghasemzadeh. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=176.8s)]
*  She's 27 years old, and she was a Christian convert in Iran. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=179.32s)]
*  She had hoped to come to America to build a new life and be able to practice her religion, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=185.1s)]
*  Christianity freely. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=191.2s)]
*  Of course, in Iran, converting from Islam is a crime punishable by death, so currently [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=193.16s)]
*  she is very, very concerned about her future. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=199.38s)]
*  In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said that none of the migrants told [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=203.32s)]
*  authorities they were scared to return to their home country. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=207.72s)]
*  But Hamed says many feel they are in danger, and some people in the hotel described desperate [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=211.24s)]
*  attempts to escape. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  One man broke his leg trying. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=218.12s)]
*  The plan to send migrants to other countries will soon extend beyond Panama. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=220.44s)]
*  Costa Rica announced yesterday that it will also accept deportees. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=225.48s)]
*  A flight carrying around 200 people, originally from Central Asia and India, is expected to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  land there this week. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=234.92s)]
*  This is an indicator that countries that are hoping to come into the good graces of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=236.84s)]
*  United States are willing to do things like this, take on hundreds of migrants from countries [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  across the world. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=248.86s)]
*  And the Trump administration has not been shy about saying that they will look for all [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=250.66000000000003s)]
*  avenues to deport people and that just because an individual is from a country that is hard [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=254.62s)]
*  to deport to, it will not prevent them from being removed from the United States. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=260.86s)]
*  And this is an indication that they really mean that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=266.24s)]
*  Three other quick updates on the Trump administration. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=271.62s)]
*  The Education Department is warning schools they will lose their federal funding if they [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=274.66s)]
*  take race into account in any, quote, aspects of student, academic and campus life. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=278.86s)]
*  The new directive could be especially disruptive to colleges and universities, including those [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=285.9s)]
*  that have race-based scholarships and grants, or even housing, like sororities or fraternities [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=290.42s)]
*  intended for students of a specific background. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=295.5s)]
*  It's the latest push by the administration to frame diversity and inclusion efforts as [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=298.42s)]
*  a form of racial discrimination, particularly against white and Asian students. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=302.46s)]
*  At the Social Security Administration, the agency's top official has abruptly resigned [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=308.58s)]
*  after refusing to give Elon Musk's team access to sensitive personal data about millions [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=313.38s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=318.29999999999995s)]
*  Musk has claimed that the Social Security program is rife with fraud and waste, but [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=320.17999999999995s)]
*  a recent audit showed that less than 1% of payments were improper. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=324.74s)]
*  It's not clear if Musk's team did eventually get access to the Social Security systems, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=328.94s)]
*  which include medical records and financial data. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=334.02s)]
*  And... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=337.06s)]
*  The events over the past month have been built to break our wills. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=338.06s)]
*  But we are the American people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=342.14s)]
*  We will not break. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=344.34s)]
*  Thousands of people took to the streets across the country yesterday to protest the Trump administration. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=350.58s)]
*  Many of them said they feel Trump is acting like a king, not a president, and they held [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=356.38s)]
*  signs with messages like, this is a coup and save democracy. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  The protests were largely organized by the 50-51 movement, which has been pushing back [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=365.09999999999997s)]
*  against what it says is Trump's overreach. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=370.14s)]
*  In the Middle East, the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas continues to hold, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=379.74s)]
*  but Israel's military has been ramping up its operations in the West Bank. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=384.86s)]
*  A weeks-long operation by the Israeli military there has forced about 40,000 Palestinians [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=389.62s)]
*  from their homes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=395.54s)]
*  It's the biggest displacement of civilians in the territory in over 50 years. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=396.54s)]
*  Residents tell the Times that soldiers used megaphones to order them out of their houses [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=402.06s)]
*  and threatened to shoot them if they didn't leave. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  Israel says its goal is to root out militant groups to prevent them from attacking Israelis. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=409.82s)]
*  And that it never ordered any evacuations. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=415.02s)]
*  The military has demolished scores of buildings, used armored bulldozers to rip up roads, and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=417.14s)]
*  destroyed water pipes and power lines, adding to the damage from previous raids in the territory. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  It's the meat! [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=440.29999999999995s)]
*  Everybody loves meat! [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=441.29999999999995s)]
*  And you can get good meat! [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=442.29999999999995s)]
*  Meat raffles are really blowing up, depending on where you live. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=444.58000000000004s)]
*  They're pretty much exactly what they sound like. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=447.98s)]
*  You buy a raffle ticket, you hope you win some meat. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=451.18s)]
*  For a dollar, maybe $5, you could win a nice steak, a pork tenderloin, I want a ham once. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=454.3s)]
*  The events have been kicking around Minnesota and Wisconsin for over a hundred years. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=460.5s)]
*  Now they're spreading to other states, also states with cold weather, where people want [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=465.14000000000004s)]
*  to pack inside in the winter and cross their fingers for a rack of ribs. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  Some churches and kids' sports teams rely on them as fundraisers. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=473.62s)]
*  Organizers say they can raise $5,000 to even $15,000 a night, depending on the turnout. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=477.74s)]
*  One woman who runs meat raffles in western New York says they've really taken off. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=483.66s)]
*  She now runs a hundred of them a year. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=488.42s)]
*  For some, the appeal is obvious. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=490.9s)]
*  A snowplow operator who went to a raffle at a VFW in a suburb of Buffalo told the Times, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=493.22s)]
*  You can win meat, you don't have to go to the grocery store. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=498.86s)]
*  How can you go wrong with that? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=501.74s)]
*  Those are the headlines today on The Daily. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=508.14s)]
*  An interview with one of President Trump's key economic advisors on how he thinks tariffs [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=510.86s)]
*  can change America's relationship with China. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=516.38s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=519.86s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=524.7s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsmJdcVktaw&t=525.7s)]
