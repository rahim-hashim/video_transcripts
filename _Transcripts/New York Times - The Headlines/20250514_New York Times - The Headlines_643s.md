# Qatar Woos Trump, Gaza at Risk of Starvation, Cannes Bans Red Carpet Nudity | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, May [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=0.0s)]
*  14th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Tonight, the Emir of Qatar is set to host President Trump for a lavish dinner at his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  palace as Trump continues his Middle East tour. His visit will mark a dramatic turnaround. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=19.2s)]
*  Eight years ago, Trump railed against Qatar's leadership and denounced what he called their [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=25.72s)]
*  extremist ideology. Now Trump calls the Emir a gentleman and a friend. In recent years, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  Qatar's managed to basically remake its image on the world stage, thanks in part to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=37.68s)]
*  massive investments it's made from its natural gas wealth. A big part of the makeover was [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  the World Cup. In 2022, it hosted the soccer championship, the most popular sporting event [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=48.12s)]
*  on the planet, and that put it on the map for a lot of people. Qatar outspent its rivals [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=53.64s)]
*  to get the hosting gig, sparking accusations of corruption. The country has also become [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=58.92s)]
*  a mediator in the region, most notably between Israel and Hamas following October 7th. And [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=64.08s)]
*  Qatar's spent millions of dollars on lobbyists in D.C. and elsewhere. One of those was Pam [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=69.88s)]
*  Bondi, who is now Trump's attorney general. Now Qatar may be looking to shore up its relationship [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=75.88s)]
*  with the U.S. even further with the gift of a $440 million luxury jet that could be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=81.74s)]
*  used as Air Force One. Trump said yesterday he would be stupid not to accept it. Even [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=87.82s)]
*  for some of the president's staunchest defenders, that's a step too far. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=93.69999999999999s)]
*  Taking sacks of goodies from people who support Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Jazeera, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  all the rest, that's not America First. Like, please define America First in a way that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=101.38s)]
*  says you should take sacks of cash from the Qatari Royals. It just isn't America First. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=105.25999999999999s)]
*  Conservative podcast host Ben Shapiro, right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, and others have [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=110.78s)]
*  blasted the idea, adding to a chorus of outrage and alarm from Democrats and ethics experts [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=115.58s)]
*  who have questioned the motives behind a gift like this coming from Qatar. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=121.58s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Time's White House correspondent Maggie Haberman has more details about the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=126.94s)]
*  controversy surrounding the plane. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=131.2s)]
*  Also on President Trump's Middle East trip. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=140.7s)]
*  The president made a surprise announcement that the U.S. will lift its sanctions on Syria, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  throwing an economic lifeline to the country that's been devastated by a decade of civil [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=160.26s)]
*  The sanctions were brutal and crippling and served as an important, really an important [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=161.26s)]
*  function, nevertheless, at the time. But now it's their time to shine. It's their time [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=167.26s)]
*  to shine. We're taking them all off. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=171.89999999999998s)]
*  People were singing, they were chanting, there were fireworks going off, they were honking [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=174.22s)]
*  their horns, they were blasting music from their cars, and there was just this kind of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=177.7s)]
*  elation in the country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=181.62s)]
*  My colleague Ben Hubbard was in Damascus when news of Trump's announcement broke. He says [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=183.82s)]
*  there's no timeline on when the sanctions will actually be lifted, but people were ecstatic [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=188.45999999999998s)]
*  idea. The U.S. put the sanctions in place years ago to punish the country's now ousted [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=193.94s)]
*  dictator Bashar al-Assad. And Syria's new government had been hoping they'd be lifted [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=199.22s)]
*  since they've made it nearly impossible to start rebuilding. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=204.61999999999998s)]
*  They really strangled the economy. They cut off Syria from the international banking system, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=207.89999999999998s)]
*  so you cannot use your ATM card, you cannot use a credit card here if you're a Syrian. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=212.29999999999998s)]
*  Living abroad, you can't transfer money to your relatives here. They made it very difficult [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=217.1s)]
*  to import many, many different kinds of goods, industrial machinery, all sorts of things, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=221.42s)]
*  and it really just kind of ground down the economy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=226.26s)]
*  Ben says Trump has been skeptical of the new Syrian government. Its president once led [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  a branch of al-Qaeda before he broke ties. But Trump seems to have been persuaded by [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=234.61999999999998s)]
*  the leaders of Turkey and Saudi Arabia to roll back the sanctions. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=239.33999999999997s)]
*  The argument by everyone who was trying to convince the United States to lift the sanctions [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=243.54s)]
*  was that a stable Syria is good for the region and it's good for the world. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=248.06s)]
*  A stable Syria will prevent a lot of the problems that have come out of Syria over the last 13 years. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=253.02s)]
*  This includes mass migration of refugees to neighboring Arab countries and Turkey. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=259.1s)]
*  This includes mass migration to Europe. And if the country can stabilize, then hopefully [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=264.14s)]
*  we'll just be more secure. You've had, you know, terrorist organizations operating here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=268.86s)]
*  ISIS took over a huge part of the country. And so having a stable central government [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=273.42s)]
*  in Damascus that can provide basic services and that can ensure security could hopefully [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=277.66s)]
*  prevent a lot of these problems that have come out of Syria during the war. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=282.62s)]
*  In Israel, the Times has learned that some of the Israeli military's own officers are privately [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=294.06s)]
*  warning that Gazans are on the brink of starvation. Israel cut off food along with fuel and medicine [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=300.3s)]
*  to Gaza in March, saying it was part of a pressure campaign against Hamas. Since then, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=306.54s)]
*  it's claimed in public that there are still plenty of supplies inside the territory. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=311.82s)]
*  But behind the scenes, the Israeli officers have determined that if the blockade isn't lifted in [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  the next few weeks, many people will simply run out of food to eat. The Israeli Ministry of Defense [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=322.06s)]
*  declined to comment on the predictions, though the dire timeline matches what aid groups have [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=328.06s)]
*  been saying. Just this week, a UN-backed group that monitors malnutrition in Gaza said famine [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=333.02s)]
*  there is imminent, and Gazans that the Times has talked with describe an increasingly bleak [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=338.78s)]
*  situation. One 71-year-old retiree said all he ate on a recent day was a bit of fava beans from a can, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  and that over the course of the war, he's dropped from 210 pounds to 130. He also said his daughter, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=351.02s)]
*  who recently gave birth, can't breastfeed because she's not eating enough, and there's no baby [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=357.34s)]
*  formula available either. We have life-saving supplies ready now at the borders. We can save [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=362.22s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of survivors, but Israel denies us access. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=370.14000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council yesterday, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=375.02000000000004s)]
*  the UN's humanitarian chief accused Israel of, quote, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=379.1s)]
*  deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians in Gaza. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=382.38000000000005s)]
*  Fourteen of the Council's 15 member countries called on Israel to immediately let aid in. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=388.54s)]
*  The only one that didn't was the United States. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=394.94s)]
*  I think if you work as a radiologist, you're like the coyote that's already over the edge of the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=408.22s)]
*  cliff that hasn't yet looked down, so it doesn't realize there's no ground underneath him. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=413.9s)]
*  About a decade ago, Geoffrey Hinton, one of the world's leading experts in artificial intelligence, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=418.62s)]
*  said he was so confident that AI was on the cusp of replacing human workers that he could predict [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  which jobs would disappear first. People should stop training radiologists now. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=430.21999999999997s)]
*  It's just completely obvious that within five years, deep learning is going to do better than [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  radiologists because it's going to be able to get a lot more experience. Hinton said that analyzing [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=439.02s)]
*  medical imaging, things like MRIs and CT scans, was exactly the kind of work that computers would [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=443.34s)]
*  soon do better than humans. But that's not what happened. Amid a broader debate about if or when [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=449.58s)]
*  AI will steal our jobs, radiologists have become a kind of case study in how the technology can [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=456.29999999999995s)]
*  supercharge human experts instead of replacing them. The Times recently visited the Mayo Clinic [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=462.85999999999996s)]
*  in Minnesota, where the Radiology Department has gone all in on AI while also boosting its staff. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=469.18s)]
*  They use the new technology to predict disease, flag suspicious scans, or analyze tissue. For [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=476.38s)]
*  example, one kidney measurement that used to take a radiologist up to 30 minutes to do is now done [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=482.62s)]
*  in seconds. That has freed up the radiologists themselves to do things that AI isn't as good at, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=487.34000000000003s)]
*  using their experience to advise surgeons, talking to patients, or putting together treatment plans [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=494.38s)]
*  based on people's individual medical history. Since Hinton's prediction, the Mayo Clinic's [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=499.74s)]
*  radiology staff has grown by 55%. It now includes its own AI team of 40 people. The head of the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=504.62s)]
*  clinic's digital programs has made his own prediction, saying, quote, five years from now, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=511.9s)]
*  it will be malpractice not to use AI, but it will be humans and AI working together. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=517.58s)]
*  And finally, the Cannes Film Festival kicked off last night in the south of France with one last-minute [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=524.46s)]
*  new rule for the celebrities walking the red carpet. The dress code now prohibits nudity. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=536.22s)]
*  Obviously, stars have been showing a lot of skin for a long time, with sky-high slits revealing [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=542.46s)]
*  cutouts, sheer fabric, mesh, etc. On the red carpet, underwear is an outfit, but the so-called [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=548.22s)]
*  naked dressing trend has been picking up speed in recent years, with outfits cut down to just [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=554.62s)]
*  strategically placed beads, or at the Grammys this year, one fully transparent nylon slip [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=563.42s)]
*  hiding truly nothing. Notably, the new dress code at Cannes also bans [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  too much clothing, basically anything with a giant train that would make it hard for people [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=584.06s)]
*  to walk around you and get into the theater. The Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman theorized [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=588.6199999999999s)]
*  that what the organizers may be trying to do is keep the attention focused on the films rather [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=593.8199999999999s)]
*  than the eye-grabbing outfits. So in that spirit, let's talk about the movies. There are a lot of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=599.18s)]
*  big English language movies this year at what's traditionally been a showcase of global cinema. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV-gKdlZv4g&t=604.8599999999999s)]
