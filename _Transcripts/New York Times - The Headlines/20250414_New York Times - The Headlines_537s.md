# China Cuts Off Critical Exports, and Meta Goes on Trial
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, April [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=0.0s)]
*  14th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=7.2s)]
*  In retaliation for President Trump's aggressive tariffs, China has hit back and suspended [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=14.16s)]
*  the export of some critical minerals and magnets. The rare earth materials are crucial to many [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=19.92s)]
*  auto manufacturers, tech companies, and the aerospace industry. They're used in everything [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=25.96s)]
*  from cars to spacecraft to the chips that go in smartphones. They're also critical [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=31.1s)]
*  to military contractors. The materials are used in drones and missiles. And there's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=36.64s)]
*  almost nowhere to get these materials except China. For now, shipments have been halted [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=41.92s)]
*  while the Chinese government rolls out new regulations on who can ship the materials [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=48.0s)]
*  Once that's done, China will have the oversight in place to permanently block shipments to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=53.04s)]
*  some companies if it wants, including American military contractors. How much the current [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=57.56s)]
*  suspension will disrupt the supply chain depends on how much factories have stockpiled. Some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=63.64s)]
*  keep little to no extra material on hand because of how expensive it is. But other companies [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  started stocking up months ago, nervous about just this kind of situation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=75.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, there appears to be no end in sight for the trade standoff between the U.S. and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=81.6s)]
*  China. The Times has learned that President Trump is open to negotiating directly with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  China's President Xi Jinping, but that he's waiting for Xi to call him personally. For [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=98.88s)]
*  the moment, the Chinese government seems to be wary of that scenario. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=104.44s)]
*  Today at the White House, President Trump will host the president of El Salvador, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=111.6s)]
*  Najib Bukele, who's become a high-profile partner in Trump's deportation efforts. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=118.0s)]
*  The administration is currently paying El Salvador millions of dollars to jail migrants that the U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=123.0s)]
*  sent there, claiming with little evidence that they're violent gang members. Bukele, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=129.44s)]
*  who's referred to himself as the world's coolest dictator, has led his own crackdown on alleged [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=134.6s)]
*  gang members. In the process, he's been accused of undermining democratic institutions in his [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  country. There have been mass arrests and jailings, often without any trials. The meeting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=145.88s)]
*  between Bukele and Trump comes after the administration says it sent 10 more migrants [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=151.6s)]
*  from the U.S. to El Salvador this weekend, where they're being held in a sprawling mega-prison. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=156.56s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the closer ties between the two countries have, quote, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=166.92s)]
*  Last night, we experienced an attack not just on our family, but on the entire Commonwealth [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=177.6s)]
*  of Pennsylvania here at the governor's residence. In Pennsylvania, authorities are investigating [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=184.32s)]
*  an arson attack on the governor's mansion this weekend that caused significant damage to the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=190.72s)]
*  property. One of the state troopers assigned to our detail banged on our door, woke us up, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=195.44s)]
*  and told us we had an emergency and needed to leave immediately. The state's democratic governor, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=202.4s)]
*  Josh Shapiro, said he and his family were forced to evacuate the house early Sunday morning after [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=208.8s)]
*  it was lit on fire. Officials have arrested a 38-year-old man who they say jumped a fence, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=214.16s)]
*  evaded state troopers guarding the mansion, and set off a homemade incendiary device. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=219.76s)]
*  He's been charged with attempted murder, arson, and terrorism. Law enforcement officials haven't [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=225.04s)]
*  identified a motive yet, though Shapiro noted that the attack came the same night that his family had [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  hosted other members of the local Jewish community to mark the beginning of Passover. This type of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=235.44s)]
*  violence is not okay. And I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=241.12s)]
*  Directed at one particular party or another, it is not okay. And it has to stop. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=250.55999999999997s)]
*  Today, the social media giant Metta, Facebook's parent company, will face off with the U.S. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=265.12s)]
*  government in a landmark antitrust case. The federal government will argue that the company [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=270.24s)]
*  broke the law when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, essentially claiming it was buying up [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=275.28s)]
*  the smaller companies to illegally try to maintain its social media dominance. They want to force [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=280.32s)]
*  Metta to sell off the two apps. But legal experts say it's going to be an uphill battle for the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=285.84s)]
*  government to make its case. It will have to prove that Metta only became as powerful as it is because [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  of those acquisitions. And Metta is expected to argue that the popularity of other platforms like [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=297.2s)]
*  TikTok and Reddit prove that there's still plenty of competition in the marketplace. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=302.96s)]
*  My colleague David McCabe, who covers tech policy, says this case will be a test of the Trump [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  administration's relationship with Silicon Valley. In some corners of the tech industry, there was [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=313.68s)]
*  optimism about President Trump's election to a second term. Executives and investors had grown [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  frustrated by the way that regulators in the last administration would block really big tech companies [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=324.32s)]
*  from buying other firms. But as President Trump begins his second term, it does seem like the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=329.12s)]
*  scrutiny of the tech industry's biggest players is not letting up. As part of the trial, Metta's CEO, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=334.24s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg, is expected to testify. In the past few weeks, he's been trying to lobby the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=340.72s)]
*  Trump administration to settle the case, making several trips to the White House and to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=345.92s)]
*  And finally. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=351.68s)]
*  Our skill set, our expertise in secret doors and hidden doors is unparalleled. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=356.24s)]
*  For the last few months, I've been looking into this niche area of the economy that I would call [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  like the panic industry. I always try to make my bomb shelters double as wine sellers, gun rims, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=368.8s)]
*  tornado shelters. Which is basically companies around the US that are catering to people who [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=374.08s)]
*  are very afraid of things like civil unrest and pandemic and myriad other things. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=380.88s)]
*  My colleague Coralie Kraft has been covering the recent surge in people spending big on [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=387.12s)]
*  home renovations they think will help them survive doomsday scenarios. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=393.04s)]
*  What I found is that these companies that build things like bunkers and panic rooms and, you know, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=398.08s)]
*  hidden gun closets and things like that are saying that business is booming. They are getting a ton [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=402.48s)]
*  of inquiries. I came across some really surprising installations they call them. Like, for example, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=407.36s)]
*  there's a family outside of Phoenix, Arizona. Off of their den in the middle of their home, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=415.2s)]
*  if you press a concealed button, a wall panel opens up and reveals a gun range inside that, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=421.04s)]
*  you know, is stocked with weapons. There is a company called Safe that is building [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=426.88s)]
*  a house for a client that's in an undisclosed location that has a moat that can be lit on fire [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  at will. At that location, there is also a tunnel that is essentially a giant microwave, meaning that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  it can heat up as a way to, let's say, repel potential intruders. Just truly some wild stuff [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=446.0s)]
*  that feels like they come straight out of the movies and things I just had no idea people were [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=453.67999999999995s)]
*  building in their backyards. Multiple people who run these companies told me that they saw a massive [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=458.4s)]
*  uptick after the pandemic. And then like with all the political turmoil, the interest just really [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=464.88s)]
*  surged. And what they're seeing is that people, even like middle-class people, people who are [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=470.47999999999996s)]
*  more interested in spending like 20 or 30 or even $10,000 on installations in their homes to make [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  them feel safer, they're just seeing a lot of that. And it's become kind of a huge segment of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=481.28s)]
*  the industry, which I think really speaks to the broadening of this market. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=487.44s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily. If I can't bring in that product and I run out of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=496.08s)]
*  what's in my warehouse now, then I no longer have revenue coming into my business. And what that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=501.36s)]
*  means is I can no longer pay my employees, I can no longer pay my loans. And in about six months, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=505.76s)]
*  I could very, very possibly lose my home. An inside look at how Trump's high tariffs on [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=511.6s)]
*  Chinese-made goods are hitting one small business in Minnesota. That's next in the New York Times [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=519.36s)]
*  audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6-2lMzaKzE&t=525.2s)]
