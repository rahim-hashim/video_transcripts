# Trump’s Gaza Takeover Plan, and Making Gods of Gamers
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=4.96s)]
*  Today is Wednesday, February 5th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=8.36s)]
*  Last night, Donald Trump made one of the most brazen declarations by any recent American [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=14.16s)]
*  president. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=19.8s)]
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=20.8s)]
*  We'll own it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=25.2s)]
*  He declared that the United States should assume control over Gaza and that the territory's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=26.48s)]
*  roughly two million residents should be moved out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=31.76s)]
*  Gaza is a hellhole right now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  It was before the bombing started, frankly, and we're going to give people a chance to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=37.26s)]
*  live in a beautiful community that's safe and secure. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=42.0s)]
*  Trump framed it as a humanitarian issue, saying Gaza is basically unlivable after Israeli [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=46.08s)]
*  attacks have turned much of it into rubble. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=51.68s)]
*  He also framed it almost as a real estate deal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=54.7s)]
*  And I don't want to be cute. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=58.1s)]
*  I don't want to be a wise guy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=59.46s)]
*  But the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something that could be so magnificent. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=60.86s)]
*  Trump said that the U.S. should level what's left of Gaza and redevelop it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=67.3s)]
*  And he said all Gazans should be relocated to countries like Egypt and Jordan, even though [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=72.06s)]
*  both countries have long rejected any kind of mass resettlement. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=76.94s)]
*  He announced the plan after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=81.24s)]
*  House. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=85.36s)]
*  And as Trump laid out the idea, Netanyahu was next to him, smiling. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=86.56s)]
*  Hamas, which still controls Gaza, immediately rejected the plan, calling it a recipe for [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=91.28s)]
*  creating chaos. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=97.38s)]
*  Trump did not cite any legal authority that would give the U.S. the right to take ownership [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=99.72s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  And he did not address the fact that forcibly removing a population violates international [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  law. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=110.36s)]
*  Instead, he claimed that everyone he'd spoken to loves the idea. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=111.36s)]
*  Do a real job. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=115.36s)]
*  Do something different. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=116.6s)]
*  Just can't go back. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=117.88s)]
*  If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for a hundred years. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=118.88s)]
*  This was an absolutely extraordinary, shocking intervention from President Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=123.32s)]
*  No one thought that the president of the United States would propose American occupation of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=130.4s)]
*  territory in the Middle East. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=136.18s)]
*  Patrick Kingsley is The Times' Jerusalem bureau chief. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=138.24s)]
*  To Palestinians, it was horrifying. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=141.16s)]
*  This would be, to them, an act of ethnic cleansing on a more terrifying scale than any they have [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  experienced since the birth of Israel in 1948. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  But in Israel, most aspects of this plan are a dream come true for Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=155.88s)]
*  and his base on the Israeli right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=162.76000000000002s)]
*  Since the beginning of the war, they have been proposing the wholesale displacement [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=166.68s)]
*  of Gaza's entire population. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=171.9s)]
*  That idea was shot down by Egypt and the Biden administration early on in the war. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Now President Trump has come back and presented it as his own plan. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=181.08s)]
*  Even in parts of the Israeli left, there was a sense that it was a good thing that President [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=186.38s)]
*  Trump was upending decades of foreign policy convention about the future of Israel and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=191.64s)]
*  Palestine. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  But all that said, the plan, to many experts, seemed so unworkable that they wondered if [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=200.2s)]
*  even President Trump realized that and if so, whether it was simply the opening gambit [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=208.11999999999998s)]
*  in negotiations around the Middle East about the future of Gaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump's facing a growing number of legal challenges as he tries to aggressively [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=221.64s)]
*  push through his domestic agenda. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=230.27999999999997s)]
*  On Tuesday alone, FBI staffers sued to stop Trump's team from releasing the names of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  everyone who worked on the January 6 investigations, saying they feared they could be targeted. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=238.92s)]
*  The Treasury Department was hit with a lawsuit after giving Elon Musk's Department of Government [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=244.56s)]
*  Inefficiency access to the private information of millions of Americans. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=249.12s)]
*  And a federal judge signed a restraining order, temporarily blocking the Justice Department [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=253.96s)]
*  from moving transgender women into men's prisons, which Trump had ordered. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=258.96s)]
*  In all, the Trump administration is now facing more than two dozen lawsuits. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=263.68s)]
*  Some legal experts say Trump may be intentionally testing the limits of his power. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=268.5s)]
*  Many lawsuits and subsequent appeals could push his policies all the way up to the Supreme [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=273.94s)]
*  Court. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=279.26s)]
*  That could give the conservative majority there the opportunity to expand presidential [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=280.54s)]
*  power. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=284.86s)]
*  The way many Americans shop online may have just hit a wall under President Trump's new [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=292.86s)]
*  trade rules for China. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=298.06s)]
*  Until this week, millions of small packages a day had been coming into the U.S. from China [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=300.38s)]
*  with little to no paperwork or customs checks because of a long-standing exemption on low-value [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=305.14s)]
*  shipments. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=310.82s)]
*  That's how online retailers like Shien and Tmoo have been able to send vast amounts of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=312.02s)]
*  cheap clothes and products directly to American customers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=316.86s)]
*  But now Trump's gotten rid of the exemption, in part because of fears smugglers have been [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=321.12s)]
*  using small packages to get fentanyl into the U.S. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=325.64s)]
*  Yesterday, the Postal Service stopped accepting all packages from China. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=329.18s)]
*  It's not clear how long the pause will last, and the Postal Service wouldn't confirm that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=334.3s)]
*  it's connected to Trump's new rules. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=338.62s)]
*  But trade experts say the policy change may have caught the Postal Service off guard and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=341.18s)]
*  overwhelmed customs officials who suddenly have to screen millions more packages. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=345.86s)]
*  Trump's trade war with China is also starting to hit American businesses. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=351.66s)]
*  My colleague Danielle Kay has been looking at the impact of the new 10 percent tariffs [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=356.5s)]
*  on all Chinese imports. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=360.42s)]
*  When looking at these tariffs and the potential fallout, economists really talk about how [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=362.54s)]
*  this is likely to ripple through the entire U.S. economy and especially hit small businesses [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=366.46s)]
*  pretty hard. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=372.14s)]
*  So I called a handful of small businesses to get a sense of how they're thinking through [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=373.34s)]
*  how these tariffs might affect their business and affect their customers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=377.86s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about the business and what you sell? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=380.74s)]
*  Yep, we are a family hardware store and we sell everything from barbecue grills to traditional [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=383.82000000000005s)]
*  hardware, paint and lawn and garden. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=389.1s)]
*  One woman I spoke with, her name is Sarah Pitkin. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=391.90000000000003s)]
*  She and her sister own four hardware stores in Virginia. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=395.0s)]
*  A lot of goods are made in China. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=397.94000000000005s)]
*  Some of the specific ones that are really causing concern would be power tools because [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  there's a very low margin in power tools. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=404.1s)]
*  And so we make just enough to actually bring them in and put them on the shelf. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=406.26000000000005s)]
*  And she said power tools, barbecue grills, electronics parts, all those are things where [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=410.42s)]
*  she expects costs to rise because of these tariffs. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=415.78000000000003s)]
*  And then because of that, she'll be forced to raise prices for her customers. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=417.98s)]
*  So we have to figure out where that breakpoint is between people still wanting to buy it [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=421.18s)]
*  and still making sales or if we raise the price too much, people will shy away from [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=425.8s)]
*  buying it and then we make absolutely nothing. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=430.54s)]
*  And finally, the computer game The Sims turned 25 this week. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=440.42s)]
*  That's a quarter century of people basically playing God with their little gibberish speaking [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=456.14000000000004s)]
*  Sims, building them dream houses, pushing them to fall in love or leaving them to swim [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=460.58000000000004s)]
*  forever in the backyard pool by taking away the ladder. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=465.82s)]
*  The Sims remember that you did that, by the way, when the game was first released back [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=469.06s)]
*  in 2000, most computer and video games were linear and goal oriented. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=473.46s)]
*  You played through the levels, saved a princess, beat the final boss. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=478.38s)]
*  But The Sims was different. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=482.14s)]
*  It was about building a world. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=483.98s)]
*  The unstructuredness was seen as a risk. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=486.3s)]
*  The inventor of the game told the Times that when he first proposed it, everyone in the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=489.2s)]
*  room hated the idea. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=493.02s)]
*  The game proved them wrong. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=495.18s)]
*  Over the years, 500 million people have played it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=497.34s)]
*  And it paved the way in part for other massively popular games like Minecraft that are all [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=500.7s)]
*  built around world building and designing your own adventure. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=506.26s)]
*  Everybody wants that, it seems. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  If you play the latest version of The Sims, The Sims can even play The Sims. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=512.5799999999999s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=520.54s)]
*  Today on The Daily, a look at Elon Musk's slash and burn campaign against the federal [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XbV-oo6CYY&t=521.98s)]
