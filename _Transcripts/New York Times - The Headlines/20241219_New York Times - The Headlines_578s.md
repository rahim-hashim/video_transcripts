# 51 Men Found Guilty in France Rape Trial, and a U.S. Shutdown Looms
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [December 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Thursday, December 19th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=7.88s)]
*  The U.S. government is less than 48 hours out from a shutdown. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=14.8s)]
*  Funding is set to run out Friday at midnight unless Congress passes an extension. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=19.32s)]
*  Congressional leaders had rolled out a bipartisan bill earlier this week to try and head that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=24.8s)]
*  off. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=28.88s)]
*  But the deal is basically dead in the water after Donald Trump ordered Republicans not [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=29.88s)]
*  to support it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=34.56s)]
*  The plan was on shaky ground to begin with. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=36.0s)]
*  It started as a simple spending extension to keep the government funded until mid-March. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=38.8s)]
*  But as negotiations went on, it became a sprawling catch-all, eventually including $100 billion [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  in disaster aid, a pay raise for lawmakers, and even a provision on where the Washington [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=50.72s)]
*  commander's football team could move their stadium. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=56.62s)]
*  Elon Musk, who Trump has tasked with slashing government spending in his new administration, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=59.42s)]
*  spent all day yesterday railing against the bill, posting nearly nonstop on X and writing, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=65.1s)]
*  Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=71.22s)]
*  to be voted out in two years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=75.98s)]
*  Trump then piled on, dismissing the bill as full of quote, Democrat giveaways. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=78.54s)]
*  The extremely vocal criticism undercut Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who helped craft [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=85.62s)]
*  the deal and had been trying to push it through. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=91.42s)]
*  So you've got a bunch of Republicans who are angry at you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=93.86s)]
*  They don't like this. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  Johnson was on Fox and Friends yesterday where he was asked about all the pushback he's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  getting from Musk and others about the bill. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=102.62s)]
*  They understand the situation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=104.9s)]
*  They said, it's not directed to you, Mr. Speaker, but we don't like the spending. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=105.9s)]
*  I said, guess what, fellas, I don't either. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=108.98s)]
*  We got to get this done because here's the key. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=111.14s)]
*  By doing this, we are clearing the decks and we are setting up for Trump to come in roaring [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=113.7s)]
*  back with America First agenda. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=118.42s)]
*  It's not clear what Johnson will do now, but the last minute scramble is a preview of the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=120.42s)]
*  difficulties that congressional leaders could face next year, trying to pass legislation [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=124.9s)]
*  under a president with a tendency to blow up political compromises. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=129.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, at the same time as Trump was railing against federal spending in the funding [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=133.5s)]
*  bill, he was urging lawmakers to increase the amount of money that the U.S. can borrow. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=144.18s)]
*  He wants Congress to raise the debt ceiling. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=149.58s)]
*  The country is expected to reach its current limit next month, and if it's not increased, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=152.34s)]
*  it could cause a default on the country's debt. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=156.54s)]
*  Many Republicans in Congress are staunchly against raising it, and Trump acknowledged [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=159.34s)]
*  that it's politically unpopular, but he said he wants it taken care of before he's back [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=163.74s)]
*  in office, writing, Increasing the debt ceiling is not great, but we'd rather do it on Biden's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=167.94s)]
*  watch. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=173.46s)]
*  In France this morning, a judge delivered verdicts in the shocking rape trial that captivated [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=179.78s)]
*  and horrified the country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=184.58s)]
*  Dominique Pellico was found guilty after he admitted to drugging and raping his wife Giselle [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=186.66s)]
*  for nearly a decade, and inviting dozens of strangers he met online to join him. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=191.62s)]
*  He's been sentenced to 20 years in prison, the maximum allowed under French law. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=196.42s)]
*  Fifty other men on trial beside him were also found guilty. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=201.46s)]
*  Prosecutors had played video after graphic video of them assaulting Giselle Pellico while [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=205.94s)]
*  she was unconscious. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=209.94s)]
*  Her decision to waive anonymity and make the trial open to the public, along with her [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  steady poise in the courtroom, turned her into a feminist hero in France, and the months-long [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=216.54s)]
*  trial sparked a broader debate in the country about toxic masculinity and the legal definition [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=222.06s)]
*  of rape. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=227.7s)]
*  Live coverage of the verdicts, including from Times reporters at the courthouse, is at NYTimes.com. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=229.34s)]
*  Across the U.S., experts say the threat posed by bird flu is growing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=234.62s)]
*  All new at noon, someone in Louisiana has been diagnosed with the first severe bird [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=249.34s)]
*  flu illness in the U.S. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=253.78s)]
*  Yesterday, health officials announced the first case of an American getting seriously [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=255.5s)]
*  virus when a person in Louisiana was hospitalized after catching it from a flock of birds in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=260.74s)]
*  their backyard. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  Just a few hours later, Governor Gavin Newsom declaring a state of emergency over the spread [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=268.14s)]
*  of the bird flu. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=273.38s)]
*  The governor of California announced a state of emergency because of an outbreak in dairy [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=274.62s)]
*  cows there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=279.18s)]
*  Since August, the virus has been found at more than 600 dairies across the state, and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=280.86s)]
*  about half of those cases have been found in just the past month, which set off alarm [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=285.66s)]
*  bells for public health authorities. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=289.66s)]
*  Officials say while the virus has been detected in raw milk samples, pasteurized dairy products [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=292.54s)]
*  are safe, and for the moment the virus still poses little danger to the average American. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=297.62s)]
*  Bird flu can't spread easily between humans, and the people at highest risk are farm workers [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=302.86s)]
*  who are in close contact with animals. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  But the concern is that every time the virus jumps from animal to animal, animal to human, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=310.66s)]
*  there's a chance it can mutate into a form that could cause a pandemic. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=316.62s)]
*  When Starbucks opened its first shop in China in 1999, it was the only coffee shop in town, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=329.66s)]
*  and they had to create single-handedly a market for coffee drinkers in a country that [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=337.58s)]
*  had traditionally always preferred tea. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=342.7s)]
*  But they did it and were hugely successful up until now, where they're suddenly faced [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=345.58s)]
*  with some ferocious competition. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=352.34s)]
*  My colleague Alexandra Stevenson covers China, where she says Starbucks is facing a big problem. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  The country is their second biggest market behind the U.S., but a slew of local chains [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=361.34s)]
*  have popped up to get a piece of what Starbucks created. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=366.38s)]
*  Starbucks' own CEO called the level of new competition extreme. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  The competitors are undercutting the coffee giant on price, which is key for Chinese consumers [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=374.46s)]
*  who are nervous about the country's struggling economy. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=379.44s)]
*  They're also opening way more stores and offering way more options. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=382.44s)]
*  Some of Starbucks' local competitors are just really nimble. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=387.46s)]
*  They're spinning out new flavors so much more quickly than Starbucks can. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=392.42s)]
*  They're selling coconut milk lattes, sugary jasmine tea frappes, lapsang sushang tea lattes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the flavors can go on and on. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=404.26s)]
*  And Starbucks still is sticking to a lot of its traditional flavors. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=407.82s)]
*  It just isn't hitting in the same way. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  Looking forward, one of Starbucks' biggest challenges could be the rise of patriotic [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=415.5s)]
*  consumers. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=421.82s)]
*  There is this rising desire to support and buy local brands over American brands. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=423.1s)]
*  And so as Donald Trump heads back into the White House and the rhetoric becomes potentially [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  more anti-China, you could see Chinese consumers saying, hey, wait a minute, why should we [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=437.24s)]
*  shop at Starbucks, an American brand? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=444.22s)]
*  And that could spill over to other products too, like why should I buy a pair of Nike [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=447.86s)]
*  shoes when I can buy a pair of cheaper local brands? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=453.06s)]
*  And finally, what could be worse than a plague of locusts? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=462.78000000000003s)]
*  How about an invasion by so-called murder hornets? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=467.18s)]
*  Five years ago, America went on red alert for the murder hornet. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=470.74s)]
*  Officials in Washington state warned that the invasive species, which is native to Asia, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=475.14s)]
*  had been discovered in the state. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=479.38s)]
*  The fear was that they could start to spread across the US and devastate bee populations, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=481.22s)]
*  and the bees had a reason to be frightened. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=486.34000000000003s)]
*  When the hornets attack, they invade a colony, rip all of the bees' heads off, and fly away [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=488.78000000000003s)]
*  with their midsections to feed their young. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=494.18s)]
*  While the scientists warned that they weren't fun for humans either, the sting apparently [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=497.7s)]
*  feels like having hot metal driven into your skin. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=501.02s)]
*  The effort to keep the insects, also called northern giant hornets, from becoming established [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=504.3s)]
*  in the US was huge. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  There were tip lines for possible sightings, traps were set, and entomologists even managed [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=511.02s)]
*  to capture a few of the hornets, attaching tiny tracking devices to them and following [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=516.42s)]
*  them back to their nests, which they destroyed with vacuums and carbon dioxide. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=521.36s)]
*  Yesterday, state and federal officials announced that all the work has paid off. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  The hornets have been eradicated from the original Washington hotspot and from the rest [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=531.86s)]
*  of the country. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=536.22s)]
*  They acknowledged that a new invasion could happen in the future. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=537.68s)]
*  But for now, things are quiet. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=540.9s)]
*  One entomologist told the Times, quote, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=542.9s)]
*  It is a rare day when the humans actually get to win one against the insects. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdtz3JlQzmM&t=545.02s)]
