# The Secret Deals Behind Trump’s Crypto Firm, and a Revenge Porn Ban
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=4.96s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, April 29th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=5.96s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=8.24s)]
*  Hello, Bitcoiners. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=11.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=16.8s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=17.8s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=18.8s)]
*  The Times has been looking into the Trump family's growing ties to the crypto industry. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=20.04s)]
*  I truly believe that this is the beginning of a financial revolution, not just in America, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=24.92s)]
*  but truly around the world. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=30.12s)]
*  Along with his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., the president has embraced the once fringe [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=31.8s)]
*  financial product. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=36.64s)]
*  And together with business partners, the Trump family even launched their own cryptocurrency [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=37.92s)]
*  firm this fall, World Liberty Financial. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Obviously, this is kind of the latest venture and the industry has come to love us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  The marketing pitch is that the firm eventually plans to operate as a new type of internet [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=50.56s)]
*  bank. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  In the months since it launched, it's cut partnership deals around the world and sold [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  its own cryptocurrency, reaping hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  That's raised concerns about who's buying in and what they may expect in return. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  So we've spent months looking into World Liberty Financial. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=71.1s)]
*  And what we have found is really an unprecedented conflict of interest, ethical issues that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=74.94s)]
*  just exceed anything that we witnessed during President Trump's first term. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=80.28s)]
*  Eric Lipton's part of the team at The Times that's been investigating the firm. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=85.4s)]
*  In the crypto world, it's kind of hard to pin down who's buying individual cryptocurrency [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=89.2s)]
*  tokens. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  But we dug in and were able to identify investors from all over the world, from South Korea, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  from United Arab Emirates, from Israel, from Hong Kong. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=102.98s)]
*  Normally, foreigners are prohibited from making campaign contributions to a president. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=106.24s)]
*  But here you have foreigners investing in his company and bringing him personal profit. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=111.16s)]
*  Eric says they also found that some of the investors in World Liberty Financial appear [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=116.8s)]
*  to have directly benefited from doing business with the Trump family. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=120.96s)]
*  He says, for example, some of them had previously been investigated by the Securities and Exchange [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  Commission, the government agency that polices cryptocurrency. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=129.88s)]
*  But after investing in Trump's crypto company, those investigations were frozen or shut down. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=133.88s)]
*  So when we think about what we found here, it's easy to compare it to the Trump hotel [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=140.96s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. during his first term, where lobbyists and foreign diplomats used [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=145.4s)]
*  to frequent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=150.88s)]
*  They were seen often in the lobby buying expensive drinks or staying in the hotel, people trying [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=151.88s)]
*  to buy access to him. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=157.0s)]
*  But this is at a whole different scale. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=158.88s)]
*  We're talking here about potentially a billion dollars worth of revenue for the Trump family, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=160.92s)]
*  unknown players that are investing in World Liberty Financial. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=166.6s)]
*  And it just makes the Trump hotel in D.C. seem like a kid's lemonade stand compared [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=170.48s)]
*  to the dollars at play here now with World Liberty Financial. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=176.56s)]
*  The Times' full investigation into the Trump family's crypto firm is at NYTimes.com. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, three other updates out of Washington. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=185.48s)]
*  The Trump administration has taken aim at the country's flagship climate report, the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  National Climate Assessment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  It examines how global warming is affecting the U.S. and the research helps businesses [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=200.04s)]
*  and local governments prepare for heat waves, floods, droughts and other crises. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=204.76s)]
*  By law, it's supposed to come out every few years. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=209.64s)]
*  Yesterday, the administration dismissed all of the hundreds of scientists and experts [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=212.48s)]
*  who had been putting together the next version. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=216.92s)]
*  Also, at the Justice Department... [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  The job here is to enforce the federal civil rights laws, not woke ideology. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, that's fine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=229.4s)]
*  We need to replace those people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=231.44s)]
*  The head of the Civil Rights Division is defending dramatic changes to the agency's mission. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=233.16s)]
*  Traditionally, the divisions worked to protect the constitutional rights of minority communities [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  by doing things like monitoring police departments and fighting housing discrimination. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, current and former staff say it's effectively become an enforcement arm for President Trump's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=248.12s)]
*  agenda, targeting college administrators, investigating campus protests, and trying [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=253.76s)]
*  to prevent trans students from playing women's sports. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=258.8s)]
*  In response to the overhaul, hundreds of attorneys and staff have left their positions there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=262.28s)]
*  And... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=269.32s)]
*  The yeas are four zero nine, the nays are two. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=270.12s)]
*  In a rare moment of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=274.2s)]
*  a bill targeting what's known as revenge porn. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=278.96s)]
*  The legislation makes it illegal to share sexually explicit photos and videos of others [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=282.36s)]
*  without their consent and requires social media companies and other online platforms [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=286.8s)]
*  to take them down within two days of any request. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=292.32s)]
*  The new law includes a ban on sharing deep fake pornography. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=295.84s)]
*  AI generated nude images of real people. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  Lawmakers said they were particularly concerned about the rise of so-called nudification apps, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=302.76s)]
*  which have made it easy for teenage boys to generate and share nude images of their female [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=308.28s)]
*  classmates. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  President Trump is expected to quickly sign the bill into law. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=314.0s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=317.16s)]
*  Who's ready? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=326.88000000000005s)]
*  Who's ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=327.88000000000005s)]
*  In Canada, the Liberal leader Mark Carney has won a new term as Prime Minister after an [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=333.08000000000004s)]
*  election dominated by rising tensions with the U.S. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=338.56s)]
*  President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=342.68s)]
*  That will never, that will never ever happen. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=348.64s)]
*  While his party was behind by double digits a few months ago, Carney's tough stance against [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=352.48s)]
*  President Trump's tariffs and his threat to make Canada the 51st state energized his campaign. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=357.72s)]
*  The conservative candidate, meanwhile, Pierre Pauliev, was seen by some voters as too closely [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=363.76s)]
*  aligned with Trump. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  During the campaign, he railed against radical woke ideology and pledged to cut Canada's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=370.46s)]
*  foreign aid. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=375.26s)]
*  His support dropped so much, he's lost his seat in parliament altogether. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=376.73999999999995s)]
*  With results still coming in this morning, it's unclear whether the Liberals will win [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=381.14s)]
*  enough votes to form a majority government or if they'll need to form a coalition that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=385.08s)]
*  would force them to work with other parties. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=389.82s)]
*  Three, we have ignition. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=391.97999999999996s)]
*  Two, one. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  At Cape Canaveral in Florida yesterday, Amazon launched 27 satellites into Earth's orbit, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=396.98s)]
*  the first phase of the company's effort to break into the satellite internet industry. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=409.82s)]
*  The technology allows for internet access in hard to reach places like offshore oil [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=414.70000000000005s)]
*  rigs, rural communities, and even war zones. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=419.66s)]
*  The launch is a big deal because they are playing major catch up to SpaceX's Starlink [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=422.78s)]
*  satellite internet, which is from Elon Musk's business. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=429.14s)]
*  Karen Weiss is a technology correspondent at the Times. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  Starlink has thousands of satellites up in space and they are improving and updating [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=435.82s)]
*  the generation of satellites that they have up there to be able to provide faster data [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=442.41999999999996s)]
*  speeds and are really making a big push to kind of dominate the sky. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=446.38s)]
*  Karen says that it could take days for Amazon to determine if the first batch of satellites [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=451.62s)]
*  has successfully deployed. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=456.38s)]
*  They're only a fraction of the nearly 600 satellites the company says it needs in order [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=458.41999999999996s)]
*  to start beaming wireless internet from space. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=462.91999999999996s)]
*  The company says it expects to switch on the service later this year. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=466.18s)]
*  And finally. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=476.02s)]
*  Oh, did you think you were at the beach? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=477.02s)]
*  The pleasant sound of seagulls around you? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=481.3s)]
*  No, no, those those are humans. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=483.74s)]
*  Participating in potentially, very potentially, the greatest sport of our time, the European [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=488.38s)]
*  Goal Scream Championship. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=494.98s)]
*  The fifth annual contest was held this weekend in a little beach town in Belgium. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=498.06s)]
*  The goal is right there in the name. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=502.74s)]
*  Who can scream the most like a goal? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRL_eB4UBw&t=504.90000000000003s)]
