# Gaza Cease-Fire ‘Right on the Brink,’ and the S.E.C. Sues Elon Musk
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=0.0s)]
*  15th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=7.4s)]
*  Israel and Hamas are right on the brink of a ceasefire deal in Gaza, according to Secretary [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=15.08s)]
*  of State Antony Blinken. And officials in the Israeli government and Hamas have both [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=19.6s)]
*  suggested they're ready to move forward if the other side signs off. Given the fragile [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=24.96s)]
*  nature of the negotiations, officials haven't laid out all of the details, but one diplomat [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=30.28s)]
*  told the Times the deal is similar to what's been floated for months, a multi-stage ceasefire [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=35.52s)]
*  in which Israel would gradually withdraw from Gaza as Hamas releases hostages and as Israel [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=41.28s)]
*  releases Palestinian prisoners. Previous attempts at a deal have repeatedly collapsed, so the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=47.2s)]
*  mood at the moment is cautious optimism. But a spokesman for Qatar, which has helped mediate [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=52.88s)]
*  the talks, said yesterday, quote, We believe that we are at the final stage. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=58.0s)]
*  As Blinken was discussing the ceasefire yesterday, he stressed the need for a post-war plan for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=65.36s)]
*  how Gaza will be governed, how it will be rebuilt once the fighting stops. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=71.08000000000001s)]
*  Each time Israel completes its military operations and pulls back, Hamas villages regroup and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=75.76s)]
*  re-emerge because there's nothing else to fill the void. That is a recipe for an enduring [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=81.68s)]
*  insurgency and perpetual war. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=87.16000000000001s)]
*  Blinken said that since October 7th, Hamas has recruited almost as many new fighters [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=91.0s)]
*  as have been killed in the war. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=96.68s)]
*  Tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern, President Biden is expected to deliver his farewell address [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=99.4s)]
*  to the country, sitting behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  The speech is a tradition that dates back to George Washington and will be a chance for Biden [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=112.56s)]
*  to try and frame his legacy. He'll be leaving the White House as a deeply unpopular president. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  But in the last few months, he's been working to highlight his record as the leader who steered [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  the country out of the pandemic and made landmark investments in infrastructure and green energy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=127.64s)]
*  When asked about what he'll do next after his 50-year career in politics, Biden recently [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=133.44s)]
*  told Democratic donors he plans to stay involved, saying, quote, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=139.2s)]
*  I'm not going to be out of sight or out of mind. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=143.04s)]
*  For four hours on Capitol Hill yesterday, one of Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=151.88s)]
*  picks, Pete Hegseth, fielded questions from senators about whether he's qualified to lead [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=157.12s)]
*  the Pentagon. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=162.58s)]
*  I'm not a perfect person, as has been acknowledged, but redemption is real. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=163.78s)]
*  And God forged me in ways that I know I'm prepared for. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=168.78s)]
*  The former Fox News host and Army veteran tried to paint his story as a redemption arc [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=172.34s)]
*  as he fended off questions about excessive drinking, infidelity and a sexual assault [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=177.82000000000002s)]
*  accusation. But some of the toughest questions of the day were about previous comments he's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=182.62s)]
*  made saying women should not serve in combat roles. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  We have hundreds, hundreds of women who are currently in the infantry, lethal members [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=191.98s)]
*  of our military serving in the infantry. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=198.78s)]
*  But you degrade them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=201.1s)]
*  You say we need moms, but not in the military. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=202.5s)]
*  Democratic senators pushed him on the issue and accused him of only tempering his views [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=206.38s)]
*  on the topic now in order to get confirmed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=211.17999999999998s)]
*  Despite the grilling from Democrats, Hegseth seems to have the support he needs from Republicans [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  to move forward with the process. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=219.86s)]
*  Meanwhile, confirmation hearings will continue today for more of Trump's picks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  Marco Rubio, who's up for secretary of state, will be at the Capitol. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=226.94000000000003s)]
*  He's actually a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will be questioning him, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  which could help him make the case that he's qualified to be the country's top diplomat. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  Also with a hearing today is Pam Bondi, Trump's pick for attorney general. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=239.5s)]
*  She's the former attorney general of Florida, and she's Trump's second choice for the role [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  after Matt Gaetz bowed out following an uproar over allegations of sexual misconduct. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=248.74s)]
*  Her hearing may not end up being particularly contentious, but if confirmed, her tenure [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=254.06s)]
*  running the Justice Department almost certainly will be. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=259.42s)]
*  Trump has made clear he wants the federal prosecutors who investigated him to be investigated [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=262.74s)]
*  themselves. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  Bondi has echoed that idea. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  The Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Elon Musk, saying he broke the law by [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=270.62s)]
*  failing to disclose how much Twitter stock he was buying before he moved to take over [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  the company in 2022. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=284.62s)]
*  The SEC says that by not making his purchases public, Musk was able to effectively get a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=286.82s)]
*  $150 million discount, since the value of the company's shares shot up after he finally [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=291.94s)]
*  did announce how many he'd bought. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=297.74s)]
*  This is one of several federal investigations into Musk and his businesses that could be [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=300.1s)]
*  shelved once Trump takes office next week. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=304.8s)]
*  Musk has been one of Trump's biggest supporters. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=308.22s)]
*  In South Korea today, police moved in on the presidential compound, climbing over barricades [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=314.5s)]
*  and detaining the country's leader, Yoon Suk-yul, to bring him in for questioning. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  Officials are investigating whether Yoon committed insurrection when he declared martial law [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=325.66s)]
*  last month, plunging the country into political turmoil. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=329.98s)]
*  Yoon's been suspended from power but is still technically in office, and the country's constitutional [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=333.94s)]
*  court is considering whether to formally remove him. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=339.26000000000005s)]
*  Times reporter Choi Sang-hun says its decision could push an already polarized country to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  the edge. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=347.54s)]
*  And finally, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=359.54s)]
*  My colleague Christina Morales has been covering the evolution of the quinceañera into the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=389.54s)]
*  quinceañero. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=401.62s)]
*  She says that the coming of age parties, which happened when you turned 15, have been adapted [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  over time from a formal Catholic rite into what can now be over-the-top parties that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=411.70000000000005s)]
*  can even rival weddings in terms of the scale and the cost, coming in at tens of thousands [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=417.46s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=422.62s)]
*  I had a chance to go to a quinceañero for a boy in Corpus Christi, Texas. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=423.62s)]
*  This was huge. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  This was the first in the family that was happening. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  He was telling me that he was just really excited to see all his friends and family [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=433.84s)]
*  and it kind of became a way of reuniting everybody. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=437.29999999999995s)]
*  But even as boys have been asking to have their own parties, these celebrations are [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=443.1s)]
*  still fairly contentious in the Latino community. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=448.22s)]
*  In the community, gender roles are very strict. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=451.58000000000004s)]
*  At the quinceañero that I went to, there were several friends that were not showing [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=455.22s)]
*  up because they felt that quinceañeras were only for girls, and so they had chosen to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  boycott. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=465.42s)]
*  But for others, the party is a way to push these gender roles. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=466.42s)]
*  Some men told me that this was their way of their sons, their grandsons, becoming a [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=472.1s)]
*  man in the same way that the quinceañera party was a way for girls to become women. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=477.5s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=486.02000000000004s)]
*  Today on The Daily, more on Pete Hegsess' heated confirmation hearing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=487.02000000000004s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=493.02000000000004s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=497.42s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weJQtz67HQs&t=498.42s)]
