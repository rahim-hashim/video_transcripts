# Republicans Face Backlash, and the Dangers of Fake A.I. Therapists
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=4.88s)]
*  Today is Monday, February 24th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=5.88s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=7.88s)]
*  We're not, we're not hearing a good story coming across the TV or out of the papers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=9.72s)]
*  Already our president is ignoring court's orders. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=18.68s)]
*  Across the country, frustrated and angry voters have been confronting Republican lawmakers [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=23.44s)]
*  as they held town halls back in their home districts. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=28.44s)]
*  The president says you want to eliminate the Department of Education. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=31.48s)]
*  Let me see if I can go back. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=37.44s)]
*  It was Congress's first recess since President Trump took office, and constituents were waiting [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=39.92s)]
*  for the lawmakers with questions about executive orders, government layoffs, and the work of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  I understand what your DOGE is trying to do. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  It's a good idea, but I think you need a better spokesman than the one you got up there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  In Trinity, Texas, this weekend, Representative Pete Sessions was pushed for answers about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  how Trump and Musk are trying to slash spending. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=65.04s)]
*  My question to you is if the two people that are making, seems to be making most of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=68.38s)]
*  decisions right now, decide to cut Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, will you [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=72.6s)]
*  be courageous enough to stand up to them? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=77.56s)]
*  So these are, these are good questions. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=80.56s)]
*  Sessions appeared unfazed by the questions, and by the people shouting over him at some [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=84.32s)]
*  points. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  He said he could not promise anyone would be insulated from budget cuts. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  Nationwide, many of the most vocal complaints at the town halls came from people who identified [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=93.32s)]
*  themselves as Democrats, but a number of questions also came from Republican voters, suggesting [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  there could be a broader backlash building for the Republican Party as Trump's policies [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=103.96s)]
*  start to take effect. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  In Washington, even some Trump-appointed officials have been publicly pushing back on Elon Musk's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=115.32s)]
*  latest demands. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=121.36s)]
*  On Saturday, an email went out to government employees with the subject line, what did [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  you do this week? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=127.88s)]
*  Musk warned that anyone who didn't respond to it with a summary of their work would lose [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=129.76s)]
*  their job. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=133.56s)]
*  The email reached workers across multiple agencies from the FBI to the FDA. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=134.92s)]
*  It even went to sitting federal judges who were not part of the executive branch. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=139.92s)]
*  The demand triggered a standoff. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=144.32s)]
*  Several agency officials, including FBI Director Cash Patel and Director of National Intelligence [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=146.96s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, urged workers not to reply. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=151.84s)]
*  Some reiterated that they were in charge of their staff, not Musk. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=156.2s)]
*  The pushback reflects a growing unease behind the scenes of the Trump administration about [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=160.36s)]
*  Musk's power. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=164.64s)]
*  Trump, however, said Saturday he wants Musk to be more aggressive. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=166.56s)]
*  Musk's latest controversial order comes as his team, the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=173.48s)]
*  is claiming that it's cut $55 billion of federal spending so far. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=178.68s)]
*  It's posted a so-called wall of receipts on its website, but the Times has found that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=183.88s)]
*  it's marred by accounting errors, outdated data and other mistakes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=188.2s)]
*  Some contracts they said they canceled were double or triple counted. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=193.04s)]
*  One line item initially claimed a contract was worth $8 billion when it was $8 million. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=197.04s)]
*  The full analysis of Doge's budget claims is at NYTimes.com. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  The highest share of German voters in decades flocked to the polls on Sunday for an election [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  with massive consequences, not just for their country, but for all of Europe. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=219.8s)]
*  The vote came amid deep dissatisfaction with the direction of the country's economy, with [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=224.68s)]
*  immigration in Germany, and with huge questions surrounding Germany's relationship with the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=229.32000000000002s)]
*  United States. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  One of the big questions heading into this vote was how well the far-right Alternative [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  for Germany, or AFD, party would do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=242.96s)]
*  This is a party that's categorized as extremist by German intelligence, that has members who [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=245.98s)]
*  have been fined for using banned Nazi slogans, even members who have been accused of trying [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=250.94s)]
*  to overthrow the government. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  And while they doubled their vote share from four years ago and have proven themselves [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  to be a real force to be reckoned with in German politics, they will not be included [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=263.5s)]
*  in the new government. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=268.12s)]
*  The party that did win was the Christian Democrats, a center-right party led by Friedrich Merz, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=269.62s)]
*  a businessman who has never run a government ministry or even a small city, but who promised [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=275.85999999999996s)]
*  to crack down on immigration into Germany and to roll back regulations and cut taxes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=280.85999999999996s)]
*  in order to restart Germany's economic engine. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  Merz also appears headed for what increasingly looks like a confrontation with the United [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  States over foreign policy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  Merz's victory came right on the third anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine, and he [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=296.41999999999996s)]
*  has promised to lead a robust defense for the Ukrainians in Europe and in Germany, supplying [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  them with more weapons and basically taking on President Trump as he attempts to negotiate [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=305.74s)]
*  a peace with Russia that cuts out Ukraine and the Europeans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  Officials at the Vatican say that Pope Francis is in the early stages of kidney failure. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=321.94s)]
*  They say he's alert, but that his condition continues to be critical, 10 days after he [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  was hospitalized in Rome for respiratory issues. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=331.82s)]
*  Yesterday, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York City said that he's, quote, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=334.82s)]
*  in very, very fragile health and probably close to death. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=338.41999999999996s)]
*  Catholic leaders have been urging people to pray for the 88-year-old pope. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=342.53999999999996s)]
*  Mental health professionals are sounding the alarm about unregulated AI chatbots claiming [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=355.78s)]
*  to be therapists. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=361.02s)]
*  Psychologically programmed therapy chatbots do exist. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=363.38s)]
*  They're set up with scripts and guardrails, and there's been a hope that they can help [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=366.1s)]
*  make up for a shortage of mental health providers. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=369.74s)]
*  But this month, the head of the American Psychological Association said that vulnerable people have [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=372.94s)]
*  been turning to sites filled with user-generated bots that anyone can talk to. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=377.96s)]
*  Some are labeled psychologist or therapist, and they can even claim to have a degree from [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=383.38s)]
*  Stanford or specialize in specific techniques. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=387.78s)]
*  Unlike therapy chatbots trained by human doctors, the fake therapy bots simply echo users' [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  beliefs back to them and, in some cases, reinforce harmful thoughts. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=397.3s)]
*  After interacting with one, a teenage boy in Texas started being violent towards his [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=402.7s)]
*  parents and a 14-year-old in Florida died by suicide. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=406.74s)]
*  Psychologists are warning that these bots need human supervision and federal oversight, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=411.62s)]
*  especially as the technology advances and they become more realistic. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=415.74s)]
*  And finally... [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=421.42s)]
*  I can't believe I'm going to be living in Fairmont, Chris. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=430.42s)]
*  A new daytime soap opera premieres today on CBS, something that hasn't happened this century. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=434.66s)]
*  Good luck, honey. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=440.82s)]
*  You're going to need it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=441.82s)]
*  Soap operas used to be a centerpiece of afternoon TV. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=444.48s)]
*  People had to get home for their stories. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=447.42s)]
*  But the shows have mostly disappeared. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=449.58s)]
*  Reality TV has taken over. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=452.02s)]
*  People get all their backstabbing, catfighting drama from real people instead. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  But now, the new soap, Beyond the Gates, is trying to bring back the form. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=458.53999999999996s)]
*  It's also the first American soap completely centered on a Black family. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=463.3s)]
*  The show is a partnership with the NAACP. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=467.18s)]
*  It follows the wealthy but drama-prone Dupreeze in suburban Maryland. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=469.74s)]
*  I didn't think that a new soap opera would ever be brought back into the lexicon. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=473.94s)]
*  And for it to be a show focusing on a Black family was something that I never imagined [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=480.3s)]
*  would happen. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=486.46s)]
*  Actress Tamara Tooney, who stars in the new show, talked to The Times ahead of the launch. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=487.86s)]
*  She was on soaps in the 80s and 90s and said there's more to them than the stereotype of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=492.42s)]
*  melodrama and hammy performances. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=496.86s)]
*  There's no such thing as soap opera acting. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=499.5s)]
*  Acting is acting and you are being truthful in the moment, whatever the moment is. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=502.46s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=511.62s)]
*  Today on The Daily, the controversial methods the Trump administration is using to deport [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=513.14s)]
*  undocumented migrants. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=517.66s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app, or you can listen wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=519.66s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=524.22s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGesVEOZlxA&t=525.22s)]
