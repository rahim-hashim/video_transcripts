# Trump Sends Marines to LA, Kennedy Fires Vaccine Experts, Remembering Sly Stone | The Headlines
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=4.88s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, June 10th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=6.68s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=8.32s)]
*  The standoff between the Trump administration and the state of California escalated on Monday [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=13.92s)]
*  as the president ramped up deployments of federal troops in response to immigration protests. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=18.72s)]
*  Trump mobilized a battalion of 700 Marines and an additional 2,000 members of the California [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=24.52s)]
*  National Guard yesterday over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=29.9s)]
*  Federal officials described it as a limited mission to protect federal property and agents [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  in Los Angeles. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=38.98s)]
*  The move especially worried state and city officials and legal experts who say active [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=40.62s)]
*  duty Marines should not be carrying out domestic law enforcement except in extreme and rare [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=45.22s)]
*  cases and that this is not one of them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=50.14s)]
*  Trump had already deployed 2,000 National Guard troops over the weekend and on Monday [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=53.42s)]
*  there appeared to be fewer clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=57.739999999999995s)]
*  Thank goodness we sent out some wonderful National Guard. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=61.42s)]
*  They've really helped and a lot of problems they were having out there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=66.7s)]
*  At the White House, Trump described the situation as quote, very well under control. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=71.82s)]
*  That mixed messaging claiming early success while flexing additional military power has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=77.18s)]
*  frustrated local officials who say they don't need or want federal help. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=82.16s)]
*  Do you know what the National Guard is doing now? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=86.78s)]
*  They are guarding two buildings. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=89.22s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=91.26s)]
*  So they need Marines on top of it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=92.26s)]
*  I don't understand that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=94.52s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said it's Trump who's provoking the unrest. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=96.38s)]
*  And on Monday, the state pushed back. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=100.94s)]
*  With this order, Trump and Hegseth ignored law enforcement's expertise and guidance and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  trampled over our state's sovereignty. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=108.38s)]
*  California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that the state was suing the administration, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  alleging that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated federal law and the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=116.5s)]
*  Constitution when they took control of the state's National Guard. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=121.1s)]
*  The complaint sought a judicial order to return control of the National Guard to Newsom. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=125.1s)]
*  In an interview with the Times, Newsom warned that there's no reason the administration [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=130.12s)]
*  couldn't do the same thing in other states, regardless of whether they have Democratic [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=134.02s)]
*  or Republican governors. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=138.38s)]
*  You're saying these operations, the ICE operations in the Los Angeles area, are continuing right [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=147.14s)]
*  now? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=151.98s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=152.98s)]
*  They'll continue every day, not only in California and Los Angeles. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=153.98s)]
*  They're going to continue every city across the country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=158.1s)]
*  White House Border Zahra Tom Homan said last night that the immigration operations that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=161.17999999999998s)]
*  prompted the protests in the first place will continue. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  Recent immigration raids have started targeting workplaces and are part of a broader strategy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  to boost the administration's deportation numbers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  In the past few weeks, those raids have happened at a construction site for student housing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=177.02s)]
*  in Tallahassee, a flood control project in New Orleans, and a landscaping site in Western [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=180.86s)]
*  Massachusetts. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=185.66s)]
*  My colleague, Ernesto Landoño, has been reporting on the administration's crackdown. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=187.18s)]
*  Initially, they said the priority was going to be to go after people who were hardened [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=191.34s)]
*  criminals who had formal deportation orders. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=196.34s)]
*  So that requires a lot of manpower and knocking on doors and trying to find people, which [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=200.22s)]
*  is very labor intensive. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  Later, we saw federal agents going very aggressively after international students and revoking [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  hundreds of visas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, the clampdown on illegal immigration is entering a new stage as work sites become [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=214.7s)]
*  a major focus. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=221.61999999999998s)]
*  You have many people working illegally in just a handful of industries. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=224.5s)]
*  We're talking things like construction, farms, food production, warehouses. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=229.26s)]
*  So the government has long known that these sectors rely very heavily on people who do [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=234.34s)]
*  not have papers. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=239.42s)]
*  And if you send agents to, for instance, a meatpacking plant or a construction site, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=241.17999999999998s)]
*  there's a good bet you're going to find a good number of people who don't have permission [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=247.89999999999998s)]
*  to be here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=252.1s)]
*  So that means that overnight, you can really boost the number of people you put into the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=253.1s)]
*  deportation pipeline. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=258.18s)]
*  In Washington, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members of a federal [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=266.62s)]
*  vaccine panel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=272.06s)]
*  The group was made up of experts who review vaccine data, debate evidence and wield enormous [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=273.62s)]
*  influence voting on vaccine recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=278.3s)]
*  Those decisions inform insurance companies and programs like Medicaid, which are required [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=283.9s)]
*  to cover those vaccine shots. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=288.34s)]
*  Kennedy noted that two-thirds of the panel had been appointed by Biden during his final [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  year in office, and he said the move would restore the public's trust in vaccines. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=294.82s)]
*  Kennedy alleged that members of the panel had conflicts of interest, which drove decision [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=300.29999999999995s)]
*  making, a claim experts said was unfounded. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  The health secretary is a longtime vaccine skeptic and, in just a few months, has dismantled [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  decades of policy standards around immunizations. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  Public health experts called the firings reckless and extreme. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=316.22s)]
*  The chair of the Infectious Disease Committee for the American Academy of Pediatrics said [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=319.56s)]
*  the firings will only drive up mistrust in vaccines, calling the action a, quote, unmitigated [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=323.7s)]
*  public health disaster. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=329.22s)]
*  The Times has been looking into how the so-called AI arms race is playing out on college campuses. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=331.06s)]
*  OpenAI, the company behind CHAT GPT, is actively working to integrate its artificial intelligence [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=344.02s)]
*  tools into nearly every aspect of college life, from tutoring to career training. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=349.54s)]
*  And some schools, rather than fight the oncoming AI tidal wave, are deciding to lean in. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=355.34000000000003s)]
*  Earlier this month, Duke University began offering unlimited CHAT GPT access to students [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=360.78s)]
*  and staff, and rolled out Duke GPT, a school-specific interface. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=365.61999999999995s)]
*  OpenAI has been courting schools across the country with similar offers. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=371.38s)]
*  It's a significant pivot, given that AI has been associated with a surge in chatbot-fueled [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=375.29999999999995s)]
*  cheating over the past few years. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=380.05999999999995s)]
*  And it comes as other tech giants, like Google and Microsoft, are vying to embed their chatbots [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=382.14s)]
*  cultivate future customers, and prepare young people for what some schools are calling a, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=387.94s)]
*  quote, future AI-driven economy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=392.9s)]
*  But the widespread adoption of AI is also essentially a massive national experiment [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=396.18s)]
*  with unknown long-term consequences for students. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=400.98s)]
*  Early studies suggest that offloading tasks to chatbots could diminish critical thinking [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=404.58s)]
*  skills. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=409.1s)]
*  Some critics are concerned that colleges are overlooking societal risks, AI labor issues, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=410.1s)]
*  and its huge environmental costs. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=414.5s)]
*  Not to mention that it's still unclear how trustworthy or reliable large-language models [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=416.62s)]
*  actually are. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=420.94s)]
*  They can still make significant mistakes, and confidently state false information as [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=421.94s)]
*  true. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  But some schools are charging ahead anyway. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=427.58s)]
*  One official from the California State University System defended the adoption of AI, saying, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=430.06s)]
*  quote, you're worried about the ecological concerns, you're worried about misinformation [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=434.86s)]
*  and bias? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=438.58s)]
*  Well, join in. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=439.58s)]
*  Help us shape the future. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=441.1s)]
*  We should note, The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, over copyright [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=443.86s)]
*  infringement. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=448.82s)]
*  Both companies have denied wrongdoing. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=449.82s)]
*  And finally, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and pioneering bandleader Sly Stone died yesterday [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=459.3s)]
*  from lung disease. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=468.62s)]
*  He was 82 years old. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=469.82s)]
*  Stone led the mixed-race, mixed-gender band Sly and the Family Stone, who had a string [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=473.86s)]
*  of soul and funk hits in the 60s and 70s, including Everyday People and Dance to the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=482.78000000000003s)]
*  Music. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=487.62s)]
*  Stone's music had a massive influence on later major artists ranging from Prince and Michael [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=488.62s)]
*  Jackson to George Clinton and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=498.18s)]
*  Born Sylvester Stewart, Stone grew up immersed in the gospel music of his Bay Area Pentecostal [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=503.42s)]
*  church and as a child, he sang in a gospel group with three of his siblings. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=509.62s)]
*  As a young man, he became a radio DJ in San Francisco. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAW27LvrWA&t=526.54s)]
