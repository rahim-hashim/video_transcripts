# A China War Briefing for Musk, and London’s Heathrow Shuts Down
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=4.92s)]
*  Today's Friday, March 21st. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=5.92s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=8.28s)]
*  I power plant some fire. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=9.28s)]
*  Very easy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  A giant fire at a power station outside London has shut down Heathrow, one of the world's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  busiest airports. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  The blaze knocked out electricity to the airport and some of its backup generators, bringing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=24.72s)]
*  operations to a standstill. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=29.68s)]
*  It's expected to stay closed all day, throwing travel worldwide into disarray. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=32.12s)]
*  Heathrow handles around 1,300 flights every day, and some planes that were en route had [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=37.56s)]
*  to be diverted mid-flight, and people who were already at the airport were told to leave. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=42.6s)]
*  In all, almost 300,000 passengers could be affected, and airport officials warned it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=47.36s)]
*  could take several days to get that number of travelers rebooked. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  The Times has learned that Elon Musk was scheduled to get a briefing at the Pentagon today about [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=60.68s)]
*  how the U.S. would handle any potential future war with China. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=67.04s)]
*  Two officials confirmed the plan for Musk's visit, saying it was going to be held in the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=72.64s)]
*  tank, a secure conference room typically used for high-level gatherings of military leaders. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Giving Musk access to some of the nation's most closely guarded military secrets would [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=83.36s)]
*  be a dramatic expansion of Musk's already expansive role in the administration. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=88.4s)]
*  It would also fuel more questions about his conflicts of interest. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=94.08s)]
*  As the head of SpaceX and Tesla, he's a leading supplier to the Pentagon, and the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=98.02s)]
*  details in this kind of meeting would be incredibly valuable for any defense contractor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=102.84s)]
*  He also has deep financial interests in China. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=108.52s)]
*  Tesla's biggest factory is there, and the companies received billions in loans from [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=111.72s)]
*  Chinese lenders. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=116.4s)]
*  And while Musk has a top-secret security clearance, a previous Times investigation into SpaceX [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=118.2s)]
*  found that Musk and the company repeatedly failed to comply with federal protocols aimed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  at protecting state secrets. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=130.2s)]
*  After the Times reported that the meeting was going to happen, Department of Defense [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=133.12s)]
*  officials and President Trump denied that Musk's visit to the Pentagon would be about [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=136.8s)]
*  China. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=141.8s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense said it would be a, quote, informal meeting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=142.8s)]
*  It's now not clear if the meeting will go ahead as originally planned. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=146.6s)]
*  In a few moments, I will sign an executive order to begin eliminating the federal Department [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  of Education once and for all. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=162.72s)]
*  Yesterday, President Trump followed through on his promise to try and close the Education [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=166.0s)]
*  Department. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  By law, that's something only Congress can do, and Trump urged lawmakers to join him [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=171.8s)]
*  in the effort. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=176.84s)]
*  And I hope they're going to be voting for it because ultimately it may come before them, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=177.84s)]
*  but everybody knows it's right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  The attempt to shutter the department tracks with a years-long push by conservatives to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  minimize the federal government's role in public education and direct more money to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=189.28s)]
*  private schools and homeschooling. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  At this point, it's unclear how a closure would affect students since the administration [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  has said some of the department's core responsibilities could be reassigned to other agencies. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  For example, its main job of distributing money to college students through grants and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=207.48s)]
*  loans could go to the Treasury Department. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=211.76s)]
*  But some of the agency's other duties may be cut back significantly or disappear altogether, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=214.64s)]
*  including its enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in schools and its nationwide testing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  program that tracks how students are doing academically. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=225.56s)]
*  In DC, the federal judge overseeing the case challenging the Trump administration's recent [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=231.76s)]
*  deportation flights says the government has continued to stonewall him. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=239.72s)]
*  The judge has repeatedly asked for a timeline of the flights to see whether they continued [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=244.6s)]
*  even after he ordered them to stop. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=249.28s)]
*  On Thursday, the judge wrote that the answers the government has supplied were, quote, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=251.88s)]
*  woefully insufficient. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=256.32s)]
*  He's now given government lawyers until next week to provide additional information. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=258.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, more details are coming to light that call into question the administration's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=265.2s)]
*  justifications for the deportations. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  President Trump claimed that some of the Venezuelans on the flights were members of a violent gang, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=273.64s)]
*  Tren de Aragua. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  He claimed the gang was an invading force controlled by the Venezuelan government, which [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=279.96s)]
*  he said gave immigration authorities the power to deport the migrants without due process. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=284.88s)]
*  But the Times has learned that a U.S. intelligence assessment appears to undercut that claim [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=290.56s)]
*  about the gang. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=295.52s)]
*  In a document circulated by the CIA and NSA, among others, intelligence officials said [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=297.12s)]
*  they were moderately confident that Tren de Aragua is not tied to Venezuela's leadership [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=302.84s)]
*  and that it's not committing crimes at its direction. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=308.36s)]
*  Also, lawyers for some of the Venezuelans that the administration deported say they're [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=311.72s)]
*  not gang members at all. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=315.88s)]
*  One deportee's lawyer said her client was accused because of a tattoo and a hand gesture [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=318.32s)]
*  that he was making in a picture on social media. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  But the tattoo is a version of a soccer team logo. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=326.0s)]
*  He is a soccer player. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=328.96000000000004s)]
*  And the gesture he was making was the common rock and roll hand symbol. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=330.6s)]
*  Multiple other lawyers say their clients were also targeted in part because of common tattoos, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=335.32s)]
*  like images of a crown and a rose. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=340.28s)]
*  Well, the president made it very clear to Hamas that if they did not release all of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=348.52s)]
*  the hostages, there would be all hell to pay. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=352.32s)]
*  The White House press secretary says the Trump administration stands with Israel as it carries [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=354.96s)]
*  out a new wave of attacks in Gaza. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  And he fully supports Israel and the IDF and the actions that they've taken in recent days. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  Yesterday, Israel expanded its operations on the ground in the territory following massive [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=367.16s)]
*  airstrikes that it launched earlier this week. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=372.6s)]
*  The renewed attacks have killed over 500 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=375.6s)]
*  And on Thursday, Hamas hit back, firing multiple rockets at Tel Aviv. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=380.72s)]
*  There were no reports of casualties. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=385.72s)]
*  A senior Hamas official told the Times that the group had waited a few days to retaliate [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=387.92s)]
*  to try and give mediators time to convince Israel to halt its new attacks. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  But he said as the operations continued, Hamas had to show it was capable of responding. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  The new wave of violence marks the collapse of a months-long ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  The Trump administration had been working to help broker an extension of that truce, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=409.36s)]
*  but there's no indication that the two sides will be able to reach an agreement anytime soon. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  And finally, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=423.16s)]
*  This was my father's kingdom, a place of fairness. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=428.16s)]
*  But the Queen changed everything. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=433.16s)]
*  The live-action remake of Snow White comes out in theaters today. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  It's an update of the 1937 Disney classic that was the world's first ever feature-length [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  animated film. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a human. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  What did you think I was? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=450.12s)]
*  Ghost. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=451.12s)]
*  This film, more than any in Disney's 102-year history, has just been plagued by problem [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=452.52s)]
*  after problem after problem. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=458.36s)]
*  My colleague Brooks Barnes covers Hollywood. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=460.32s)]
*  He says the film hit multiple production roadblocks during the pandemic. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=462.92s)]
*  Then executives kept asking for re-dos of the visual effects. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=467.88s)]
*  And there was a controversy around whether human actors would play the seven dwarves. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=472.32s)]
*  They ended up using CGI. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=476.6s)]
*  But the film's biggest drama has centered on its star. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=479.46s)]
*  When Disney first started making this, Disney and Hollywood in general was really under [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  pressure to diversify its casting. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=489.34s)]
*  And so with Snow White, they found an actress, Rachel Ziegler, who they really loved. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=493.34s)]
*  She wowed them with her voice. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=498.46s)]
*  They loved her screen presence. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=500.5s)]
*  And she also happened to be a Latina. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=502.41999999999996s)]
*  But almost immediately, there was backlash from the right. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=505.24s)]
*  Why is a Latina playing a character that has classically been white, snow-woke, trended? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=510.72s)]
*  It kind of simmered in the background until Ziegler started becoming very outspoken in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=518.16s)]
*  interviews and on social media about topics that had nothing to do with the film. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=524.8s)]
*  She posted in support of Palestinians repeatedly. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=531.72s)]
*  She attacked Donald Trump after he won re-election. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  And those things really fueled pushback around the film and also around her and the casting. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  So what had been sort of a simmering controversy became a full inferno. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=547.24s)]
*  By the time you get to the premiere last weekend, Disney was pretty freaked out. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=553.88s)]
*  It curtailed media access to the red carpet. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=559.2s)]
*  It increased security. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=561.76s)]
*  There were protesters on the curb. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=563.84s)]
*  And the whole promotion and press tour of the movie was impacted. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=567.08s)]
*  So this movie really arrives in theaters as a test. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=575.36s)]
*  To what degree will all of these controversies over years of production impact ticket buyers? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=579.1600000000001s)]
*  Will they care? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  Or will this movie do what so many other Disney movies have, which is provide some [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=586.5s)]
*  babysitting on a Saturday for the family? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=592.56s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oa1rR8ynM_M&t=599.26s)]
