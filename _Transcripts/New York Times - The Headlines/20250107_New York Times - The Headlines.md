# Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Resign, and U.S. Reports First Bird Flu Death
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [January 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=5.04s)]
*  Today's Tuesday, January 7th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=6.04s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=8.24s)]
*  Last night over dinner, I told my kids about the decision that I'm sharing with you today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=14.76s)]
*  I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister, after the party selects its next [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=20.32s)]
*  leader through a robust, nationwide, competitive process. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=28.0s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced yesterday that he will step down from the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=33.24s)]
*  country's top post, bowing to an increasingly disgruntled public and to tensions within [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=37.24s)]
*  his own Liberal Party. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=42.76s)]
*  It's time for the temperature to come down, for the people to have a fresh start, to be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=44.4s)]
*  able to navigate through these complex times, both domestically and internationally. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Trudeau came to power nearly a decade ago, writing the same message of hope and change [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=56.04s)]
*  as Barack Obama, but he's now the latest Western leader to fall to a wave of dissatisfaction. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=60.68s)]
*  Unemployment's high, the pain of inflation's still fresh, and there's been backlash to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=67.4s)]
*  the country's immigration policies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=71.76s)]
*  A poll last month showed 73% of Canadians wanted Trudeau out as party leader. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=74.08s)]
*  His resignation comes as Canada's facing a major economic threat, American tariffs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=80.52s)]
*  Donald Trump has threatened to put 25% tariffs in place on Canadian imports if the country [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=86.36s)]
*  doesn't do more to stop drugs and migrants from coming across the border. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=92.0s)]
*  The tariffs would upend Canada's economy, since the US and Canada are each other's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=96.36s)]
*  largest trading partners. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Trudeau flew to Mar-a-Lago for talks with Trump after he announced the tariffs, but [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=103.32s)]
*  Trump mocked him online afterwards and has even joked that Canada should become America's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=107.56s)]
*  51st state. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=112.88s)]
*  For now, Trudeau will stay on as prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party until a replacement [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=115.0s)]
*  can be chosen. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=119.72s)]
*  General elections must happen by October, but a vote could happen earlier. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  The first person in the US to get seriously ill from bird flu has now died. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=132.2s)]
*  The patient, who lived in Louisiana, got infected after being exposed to wild birds [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=136.92s)]
*  and a backyard flock. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=141.28s)]
*  Health officials said the person was over 65, had underlying health conditions, and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  had been hospitalized since last month. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  It's the only death so far caused by the virus in the US, and officials say there are [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=150.2s)]
*  no other cases in the state and no evidence of human-to-human transmission. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  Still, samples of the virus from the patient show that it had mutated over the course of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  the illness in a way that might allow it to infect other people more easily. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=163.64s)]
*  Scientists say people should avoid sick animals and wild birds, and because the virus has [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  been spreading rapidly among dairy cattle, you should not drink raw milk. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, in China, a surge in cases of a different virus, human metanumavirus, known [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=178.6s)]
*  as HMPV, has sparked fears online, but medical experts say it's not a major concern. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  The respiratory virus is similar to RSV and generally causes cough, fever, and congestion. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=190.92s)]
*  Patients with pre-existing conditions can get more sick, though it's rarely fatal in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  countries with advanced healthcare systems. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=201.44s)]
*  With just two weeks until Donald Trump takes office, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=209.98s)]
*  Instagram, and WhatsApp, is tightening its ties to his administration. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=214.92s)]
*  The company's donated a million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund, appointed a new head [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=219.5s)]
*  of global policy known for his Republican connections, and has now added a longtime [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=223.98s)]
*  friend of Trump's to the Meta board, Dana White. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=229.62s)]
*  White runs UFC, Ultimate Fighting Championship, which has become something like the semi-official [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=233.46s)]
*  sport of the MAGA movement. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=238.58s)]
*  In a post announcing the appointment, Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote that he admires [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=240.94s)]
*  White's, quote, ability to build such a beloved brand. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=245.58s)]
*  Zuckerberg and White have bonded over mixed martial arts. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=249.78s)]
*  Zuckerberg started fighting himself back in 2022. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=252.9s)]
*  White then tried to organize a televised cage match between Zuckerberg and another billionaire, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=256.26s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=261.1s)]
*  White said he spent days on the phone with them trying to broker the spectacle, but Musk [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=262.54s)]
*  eventually backed out of the battle. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  It's now been nearly three years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and Moscow is continuing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=275.58s)]
*  to push forward on the front lines at great human cost, not just to Ukrainian troops and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=282.9s)]
*  civilians, but to its own soldiers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=288.9s)]
*  Russia's classified a lot of details about how many soldiers have been killed or wounded, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=292.14s)]
*  but some estimates say 300,000 Russian soldiers have now been seriously injured. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=296.06s)]
*  That's left the country scrambling to accommodate them as they return home, whether that's [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=301.26s)]
*  considering a record number of prosthetic limbs or trying to train more therapists to deal [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=305.58000000000004s)]
*  with the mental health toll. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=310.1s)]
*  I was able to speak to a Russian colonel who expressed concern that really surprised me [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  for such a high-level military official to say that, you know, Russia was not institutionally [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=317.82000000000005s)]
*  ready to help returning soldiers grapple with PTSD. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=322.92s)]
*  Valerie Hopkins covers Russia for the Times. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  She's been looking at how the country is trying to reintegrate so many veterans. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  People are aware of stories of veterans returning and becoming violent and are frankly concerned [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=335.38s)]
*  about the way that the return of participants in the war will reverberate in society. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=343.94s)]
*  You know, I was on a train from the city of Rostov in the west to Moscow, and I spoke [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=351.7s)]
*  to women there who were concerned Rostov is a big hub for soldiers that are returning [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  back home from the front. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=364.46s)]
*  And the woman said she had paid a lot extra to sleep in a women's only car because she [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=366.82s)]
*  had had a negative experience with soldiers. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=372.46s)]
*  And it prompted a discussion in our whole train cabin about the consequences of people [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=374.82s)]
*  who have witnessed so much horror and experienced so much trauma and what that means as they, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=381.48s)]
*  you know, continue to live their lives back in a civilian society. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=387.7s)]
*  And finally, there's been an unlikely surge in tourism in a country many governments [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=394.38s)]
*  are explicitly warning against traveling to. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=405.98s)]
*  This is what it's like to backpack in Taliban controlled Afghanistan as an American tourist. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=409.14s)]
*  We then tasted the delicious Afghani bolani and Afghan stuffed flatbread. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=413.14s)]
*  It's a country that I wanted to visit for a long time. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=417.46s)]
*  Despite everything going on politically, I still wanted to see the country for myself. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=420.02s)]
*  After decades of war and terrorism, the Taliban government in Afghanistan has started promoting [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=423.22s)]
*  travel to the country in part to boost its struggling economy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=427.6s)]
*  My colleague David Zecchino says over 14,000 people from around the world have made the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  trip in the last few years, exploring Afghanistan's mosques, museums and mountains, despite the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=436.1s)]
*  travel warnings and a deadly attack last year on a group of visitors. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  Two of the tourists I talked to said they had visited every other country in the world [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=445.98s)]
*  Afghanistan and Afghanistan had been on their list for a long time, so they were checking [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=451.54s)]
*  it off. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=455.22s)]
*  Another one had visited more than 100 countries, so they tended to be very experienced travelers [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=456.5s)]
*  and were willing to take the risk. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=462.48s)]
*  I ran into one woman, a 23 year old from Japan, who had traveled alone through Pakistan on [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=464.74s)]
*  her own and crossed the border into Afghanistan. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=472.1s)]
*  I did ask her about being a woman there and how she felt about it, whether she had concerns [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=474.98s)]
*  and she said she knew treatment of women in Afghanistan is horrible, but she said she [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=480.34s)]
*  was treated very well, was not harassed in any way. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=484.94s)]
*  She mentioned to me that some people looked at her with a lot of curiosity and a little [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=489.3s)]
*  bit of disapproval and because of that, she said she was considering buying a headscarf. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=494.88s)]
*  But otherwise, she said she had a very wonderful trip and I'm sure the experience was exactly [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=500.06s)]
*  what the Taliban was hoping for. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=505.3s)]
*  They are really counting on the word getting out as a way to sort of open up Afghanistan [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=507.7s)]
*  to the world and bring in hard currency. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=511.94s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=518.42s)]
*  Today on The Daily, Republicans will soon control both the House and the Senate. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=519.42s)]
*  A look at how they may still struggle to push through Trump's agenda. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=524.26s)]
*  That's next in the New York Times audio app where you can listen wherever you get your [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=528.8199999999999s)]
*  podcasts. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=531.9s)]
*  I'm Tracy Mumford. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbjD_9LFgKA&t=532.9s)]
