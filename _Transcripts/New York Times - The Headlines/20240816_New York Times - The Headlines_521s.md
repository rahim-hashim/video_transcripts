# Harris’s Strategically Vague Economic Message, and Russians Feel the War
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, August [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=0.0s)]
*  16th. Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=7.32s)]
*  The Biden administration unveiled the results of its landmark negotiations over drug prices [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=14.08s)]
*  yesterday, and it could mean massive savings for the federal government. The administration [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  negotiated price limits with pharmaceutical companies for 10 medications, including widely [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=24.92s)]
*  used blood thinners and arthritis meds. The Biden administration said if the prices were [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=30.32s)]
*  already in effect, Medicare would have saved $6 billion last year. The new prices will [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=35.46s)]
*  kick in in 2026, and the vast majority of the savings will be for Medicare, which is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=41.8s)]
*  funded by taxpayers. But the negotiations could also lead to out-of-pocket savings for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  some of the millions of Americans who take the drugs covered by the deal. It's the first [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=53.16s)]
*  time the federal government has ever negotiated directly with drug makers on behalf of Medicare [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=58.4s)]
*  recipients. And the talks were authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, one of President [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  Biden's signature pieces of legislation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=68.96s)]
*  I've been waiting for this moment for a long, long time. The first time I sponsored a bill [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=72.08s)]
*  to let Medicare negotiate the price of drugs was in 1973 as a freshman senator. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=79.84s)]
*  Biden marked the moment yesterday at an event in Maryland alongside Kamala Harris, and he [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=86.28s)]
*  emphasized that under the Inflation Reduction Act, the government will be able to continue [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=91.08s)]
*  negotiating drug prices for a growing list of medications. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  We're just getting started. Under the law, I sign Medicare can negotiate lower prices [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=100.0s)]
*  for another 15 drugs next year, 15 the following and 20 after that till every drug is covered. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=104.96s)]
*  At yesterday's event, Harris credited Biden with making health care more affordable for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=111.36s)]
*  Americans. As she's risen to the top of the ticket, questions have been swirling about [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  what policies her administration would promote, especially about cost of living and the economy. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  I cover economic policy at the White House, which often means really detailed plans, presidential [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=127.0s)]
*  budgets, the cost of tax increases or tax cuts over the course of a decade. And so far [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=132.68s)]
*  in covering Vice President Harris's run to the White House, she just hasn't put out much [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=139.32s)]
*  detail at all on the economic proposals she's offering and what they might cost. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  Jim Tankersley has been covering how Harris and her campaign have been talking about the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=149.08s)]
*  economy. She's set to give her first speech on the topic today in Raleigh, North Carolina. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=152.56s)]
*  Jim says she's expected to focus on the idea of reining in the cost of living, but there [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=158.44s)]
*  likely won't be a lot of specifics. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=163.12s)]
*  The strategy that many of Harris's advisors are kind of pushing her towards is something [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=165.48s)]
*  I call strategic vagueness. Like you want to tell people in principle what your priorities [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=169.76s)]
*  are. I want to bring down housing costs and you might flesh out some policies that would [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=176.84s)]
*  help do that. But the more detail you offer, the more you give your opponents to attack. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=181.64s)]
*  And so if you don't have to put out that detail, the argument goes from her aides, why would [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=188.34s)]
*  you? You have plenty of time if you win the election to actually assemble a policy blueprint [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=192.74s)]
*  for when you take office. It was actually something that Donald Trump, her opponent [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=197.94s)]
*  is doing too. He doesn't detail anything. He just sort of tosses out numbers every once [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=201.3s)]
*  in a while, but it has worked for him. And so I think that this is sort of, in some ways, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=205.32s)]
*  Harris taking a page from that approach of, I'm going to try to be clear with people about [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=211.94s)]
*  what I want to do with the economy, but I don't have to give them, you know, a hundred [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=216.84s)]
*  numbers to attack. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=220.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump held a news conference yesterday, which was also intended to highlight economic [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=225.2s)]
*  issues. Grocery prices have skyrocketed. Cereals are up 26 percent. Bread is up 24 percent. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=230.39999999999998s)]
*  Butter is up 37 percent. He spoke in front of a table displaying gallons of milk, cans [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  of soup and a dozen eggs and started his speech by blaming the Biden administration for rising [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=243.72s)]
*  food costs. Trump's advisors have been urging him to focus on topics like inflation that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=248.56s)]
*  they think will sway undecided voters. But as his speech went on and he took questions [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=254.6s)]
*  from reporters, Trump veered into wide ranging tangents, complaining about Hillary Clinton, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=259.68s)]
*  windmills and Kamala Harris. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=265.48s)]
*  I'm very angry at her that she'd weaponized the justice system against me and other people. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=267.6s)]
*  I'm very angry at her. I think I'm entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=272.72s)]
*  respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  Recent polls have shown Harris gaining ground in key swing states, though the race remains [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=281.68s)]
*  tight. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  In the Russian region of Kursk, Ukrainian forces are continuing their attacks more than [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  10 days after launching their surprise offensive across the border. While their progress has [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=301.8s)]
*  slowed, Ukrainian officials say their forces have taken control of their first urban center, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  the town of Suja, and that hundreds of Russian soldiers have surrendered. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=312.32s)]
*  If you're following this Ukrainian invasion on Russian TV, everything seems to be under [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=316.84s)]
*  control. But our reporting shows that on the ground, things are really different. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=322.56s)]
*  Anton Churianovsky covers Russia for the Times. He says that in the area near the invasion, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=328.48s)]
*  more than 130,000 Russians have had to evacuate, seek shelter. The air raid sirens have been [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  constant. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  One conversation that really stuck with me as I've been on the phone talking to people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=340.32s)]
*  in Russia and in Kursk this week has been this conversation that a Russian opposition [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  politician described having with a displaced woman at a shelter. This woman told this politician [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=349.14000000000004s)]
*  I spoke to that she'd been there since the first day of the war. And then the politician [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=357.22s)]
*  realized that by the first day of the war, she didn't mean February 2022 when Russia [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=362.36s)]
*  invaded, but she meant last week when Ukraine invaded. And that really drove home the point [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=368.42s)]
*  to me that this is a moment that is really bringing this now 30-month long war into Russian [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=374.88000000000005s)]
*  homes in a very different way than they've experienced it up until now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=384.54s)]
*  And finally, we're here today to announce federal criminal charges related to the death [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  of the actor Matthew Perry. In Los Angeles yesterday, prosecutors announced charges against [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=402.18s)]
*  five people for providing ketamine to Matthew Perry, the star of Friends, who was found [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=408.44s)]
*  dead last year after taking the drug. The charges were filed against Perry's personal [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=413.84s)]
*  assistant, an acquaintance, two doctors and a drug dealer known as the ketamine queen. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  These defendants took advantage of Mr. Perry's addiction issues to enrich themselves. They [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew what they were doing was risking great [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=430.91999999999996s)]
*  danger to Mr. Perry, but they did it anyways. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=436.32s)]
*  Ketamine is a powerful anesthetic with psychedelic properties, and it's been increasingly used [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=439.94s)]
*  as an alternative therapy for some mental health issues. Authorities say Perry became [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=444.76s)]
*  addicted to it after using it to treat his depression and anxiety, and that he turned [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=450.0s)]
*  to illegal sources after a local clinic refused to raise his dosage. In text messages between [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=454.74s)]
*  the two doctors who were charged, one of them wrote, quote, I wonder how much this moron [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=460.72s)]
*  will pay and sold more than $50,000 of ketamine to Perry's assistant. His assistant told [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=465.9s)]
*  law enforcement that in the weeks leading up to Perry's death, he was giving the actor [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=472.82s)]
*  six to eight shots of ketamine per day. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=477.58s)]
*  Those are the headlines. Today on The Daily, the climate consequences of America's dependence [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=485.58s)]
*  on air conditioning. You can listen on the Times audio app or wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=492.2s)]
*  This show is made by Jessica Metzger, Jan Stewart, and me, Tracy Mumford, with help [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH7Jnry7-Ag&t=498.65999999999997s)]
