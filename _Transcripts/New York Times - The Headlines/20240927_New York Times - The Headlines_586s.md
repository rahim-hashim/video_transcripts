# Helene Roars on After Lashing Florida, and the Charges Facing Eric Adams
**New York Times - The Headlines:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y)
*  From the New York Times, it's the headlines. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=5.0s)]
*  Today's Friday, September 27th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=6.48s)]
*  Here's what we're covering. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=8.4s)]
*  Overnight, Hurricane Helene smashed [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=17.52s)]
*  into Florida's Gulf Coast, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=19.8s)]
*  making landfall as a category four storm [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=21.36s)]
*  with wind speeds of 140 miles per hour. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=23.92s)]
*  We're gonna be waking up to a state [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=27.12s)]
*  where very likely there's been additional loss of life [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=28.88s)]
*  and certainly there's gonna be loss of property. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=33.24s)]
*  Governor Ron DeSantis said there had been [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=37.44s)]
*  at least one death so far in the state [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=39.08s)]
*  and that residents should be prepared [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=41.32s)]
*  for serious damage from the hurricane, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=42.96s)]
*  which was the most powerful [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=44.92s)]
*  to ever strike that part of Florida. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  The vast storm weakened as it came ashore, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=48.76s)]
*  but it's causing havoc across the wider region. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=51.08s)]
*  In the Tampa area, water levels surged [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=54.08s)]
*  to two feet above record highs, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=56.28s)]
*  millions of people are without power, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=58.64s)]
*  and the storm is still on the move. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  It's caused at least three other deaths across the South. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=62.52s)]
*  Authorities are predicting that for the western part [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=65.68s)]
*  of the Carolinas, it could be one [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=67.64s)]
*  of the most significant weather events in the modern era [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=69.56s)]
*  with catastrophic flooding and significant landslides. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=72.36s)]
*  Eric Adams, the Democratic mayor of New York, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=81.72s)]
*  has been ordered to appear in federal court today [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=84.08s)]
*  for his arraignment. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=86.4s)]
*  He's been charged with bribery, fraud, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=87.56s)]
*  and soliciting foreign campaign donations. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=89.56s)]
*  Public office is a privilege. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=92.0s)]
*  We allege that Mayor Adams abused that privilege [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  and broke the law. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=97.28s)]
*  Laws that are designed to ensure that officials [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=98.8s)]
*  like him serve the people, not the highest bidder. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  At a press conference yesterday, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=104.84s)]
*  prosecutors unveiled details of the indictment. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=106.36s)]
*  They say that for years, Adams accepted free [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  or heavily discounted airline tickets [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=112.08s)]
*  and plush hotel accommodations from Turkey, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=114.12s)]
*  in total worth over $100,000. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=116.8s)]
*  He also allegedly accepted illegal campaign contributions [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=119.8s)]
*  from Turkish businessmen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=123.2s)]
*  In exchange, prosecutors say Adams granted political favors [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=125.0s)]
*  to Turkish officials in New York, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=128.6s)]
*  the most notable pressuring the fire department [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=130.76s)]
*  to ignore safety concerns and rush through a certification [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  of the Turkish consulate's new high-rise building [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=137.12s)]
*  in Midtown Manhattan. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=139.6s)]
*  These are bright red lines, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=140.88s)]
*  and we allege that the mayor crossed them again [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  and again for years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=145.44s)]
*  That is the only reason we are here today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=146.96s)]
*  My day today will not change. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=150.36s)]
*  I will continue to do the job for 8.3 million New Yorkers [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  that I was elected to do. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  Adams held his own press conference yesterday, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=161.4s)]
*  surrounded by allies and religious leaders. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  He vowed to stay in office, even as he and his supporters [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=166.12s)]
*  were almost drowned out by protesters. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=169.24s)]
*  Resign, resign, resign, resign, resign, resign. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=171.56s)]
*  For more on the investigation into Adams, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=177.16s)]
*  listen to today's episode of The Daily [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  with Time City Hall Bureau Chief, Emma Fitzsimmons. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  At the same time that New York City's own government [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=189.84s)]
*  has been thrown into turmoil, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=192.12s)]
*  the city is hosting leaders from around the world [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=193.88s)]
*  for the United Nations General Assembly. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=196.44s)]
*  Today, all eyes will be on Israeli Prime Minister [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=198.96s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, who is scheduled to give a speech [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=201.2s)]
*  to the assembly this morning. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=204.04s)]
*  Netanyahu, you're a coward! [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=205.48s)]
*  Netanyahu, you're a coward! [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=207.48s)]
*  As Netanyahu arrived in New York yesterday, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  thousands of demonstrators took to the streets [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=212.04s)]
*  to protest Israel's ongoing war in Gaza [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=214.04s)]
*  and its recent surge of attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  A year ago, when Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=220.16s)]
*  the UN General Assembly, he gave a very rousing, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  ambitious speech where he spoke about a pathway [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  to solving the Israeli-Arab conflict. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=231.84s)]
*  And now, a year later, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=236.32s)]
*  peace has not for a long time looked further away. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  Times correspondent, Isabel Kirchner, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=241.88s)]
*  has covered Israel for more than 30 years. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=243.76s)]
*  Many Israelis have expressed surprise [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=246.12s)]
*  that he would leave the country at this stage, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=249.72s)]
*  given the precarious security situation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=252.04s)]
*  But for Netanyahu, these speeches on the world stage [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=256.36s)]
*  at the United Nations are traditionally extremely important. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=260.0s)]
*  He often comes equipped with theatrical props [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=264.88s)]
*  like maps and photographs to add to the drama. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=268.76s)]
*  He sees these as historic occasions [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=272.84s)]
*  where he can try to make Israel's case to the world [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=275.88s)]
*  while at the same time, keeping a very close eye [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=280.84s)]
*  on his domestic audience at home. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=284.32s)]
*  We'll have to wait and see whether in the speech today, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  he does double down on the need to continue [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=292.08s)]
*  with full force fighting both Hamas in Gaza [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=296.64s)]
*  and Hezbollah in Lebanon, or whether he might open the door [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  or leave open a door to more diplomacy [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  and a different path forward. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=308.28s)]
*  Meanwhile. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=314.28s)]
*  We have to keep pressure on Russia to stop the war [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=315.11999999999995s)]
*  and to make truly lasting and just peace. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=319.11999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine's president is on a whirlwind diplomatic tour [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=322.52s)]
*  of the U.S., trying to secure more American support [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=325.67999999999995s)]
*  as his troops struggle to hold ground against Russia. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky spoke at the UN [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=332.32s)]
*  and met with President Biden, Vice President Harris, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=334.44s)]
*  and lawmakers on Capitol Hill. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  Later today, he's also set to meet with the President [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  While the White House did offer several billion dollars [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=342.68s)]
*  in new military aid, Biden's still holding out [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=345.0s)]
*  on Zelensky's biggest ask, getting the green light [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=347.52000000000004s)]
*  to use long range American missiles to hit army bases [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=350.56s)]
*  and stockpiles of ammunition deep inside Russia. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  The Times has now learned about an intelligence assessment [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=356.68s)]
*  that could explain why Biden hasn't given permission. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  U.S. intelligence agencies think that if Ukraine [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=362.48s)]
*  used those weapons for long range strikes, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=364.8s)]
*  Russia would retaliate with the same weapons [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=367.24s)]
*  and that could include stepping up the sabotage [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  and arson attacks it's been covertly conducting in Europe [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=371.52s)]

*  That assessment also says that those risks [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=378.64s)]
*  might not be worth the reward, laying out how Ukraine's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=380.68s)]

*  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=390.04s)]

*  Until now, anti-psychotic drugs have worked by blocking [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  a dopamine receptor, which has led to side effects [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=401.48s)]
*  like sluggishness, a lack of motivation, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=404.16s)]

*  has led to sluggishness, a lack of motivation, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=419.08s)]

*  The new drug, known as cobenfi, is designed to block [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=423.92s)]
*  that dopamine receptor indirectly instead, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=427.16s)]

*  Let me tell you a little bit about our honoree. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  Batman is one of the world's most iconic characters, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=448.52s)]
*  standing for justice, strength, and fearlessness. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=452.52s)]
*  85 years after he was first created, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=456.28s)]
*  Batman, the comic book, television, and film icon, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=458.92s)]
*  is finally getting a Hollywood star. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=462.24s)]
*  And now we're so proud that he is the first superhero [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=464.36s)]
*  to land right here to receive a permanent star [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=467.52s)]
*  on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=470.96s)]
*  On Thursday, the caped crusader beat out a long list [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=473.4s)]
*  of spandex-wearing competition, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  including Superman, Spider-Man, and Captain America, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=477.88s)]
*  to be the first superhero [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  with a place on the iconic sidewalk. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=482.08s)]
*  Batman, clad in the somber costume [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=484.28s)]
*  which has struck terror to the heart [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=486.96s)]
*  of many a swaggering denizen of the underworld. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=488.44s)]
*  Batman has been an enduring figure in pop culture [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=490.96s)]
*  and has been adapted again and again to reflect the times. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=493.84s)]
*  He started off as a shadowy swashbuckling detective [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=497.12s)]
*  before being reimagined as a campier character [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=500.2s)]
*  in the 1960s. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=502.64s)]
*  You'll never get away with this, Riddler. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=504.0s)]
*  Would you like to make a little wager? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=505.84s)]
*  I never gamble. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=508.88s)]
*  In the late 80s, Tim Burton imagined his version of Batman [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=511.28s)]
*  that arguably came to define superhero movies [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=514.76s)]
*  for the next three decades. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=517.24s)]
*  I'm not going to kill you. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=518.8s)]
*  I want you to do me a favor. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=520.24s)]
*  I want you to tell all your friends about me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=521.84s)]
*  What are you? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=523.64s)]
*  I'm Batman. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  Get out! [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=528.0s)]
*  And the 2007 hit, The Dark Knight, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=529.0s)]
*  proved that superhero movies and superheroes [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  could be taken seriously. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=534.16s)]
*  And tonight you're gonna break your one rule. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=535.52s)]
*  I'm considering it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=538.48s)]
*  Batman now joins the ranks of some of the real people [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=539.68s)]
*  who've brought him to life. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=542.28s)]
*  One of his creators, Bob Kane, has a Hollywood star. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=543.8s)]
*  So does Adam West, who played him on TV, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=546.6s)]
*  as well as Burt Ward, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=549.12s)]
*  who played Batman's trusty sidekick, Robin. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=550.28s)]
*  No word on whether Robin himself will be getting a star. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=553.12s)]
*  Those are the headlines. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=557.16s)]
*  This show is made by Robert Jemison, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=558.9599999999999s)]

*  Zoe Murphy, and Paula Schumann. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dgiL96a8Y&t=571.24s)]
