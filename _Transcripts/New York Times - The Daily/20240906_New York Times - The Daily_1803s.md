# The First Post-Affirmative Action Class Enters College
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y-BXL7tstc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benhold, and this is The Daily.
*  The Supreme Court's decision to ban affirmative action last summer was expected to drastically
*  change the demographics of college campuses around the country.
*  Now we're starting to understand the extent of that change.
*  Today, my colleague David Leonard explains.
*  It's Friday, September 6th.
*  David, welcome back to the show.
*  Thank you, Katrin.
*  So in the past few weeks, elite colleges around the US have started to release their enrollment
*  numbers for this academic year, which is the first academic year since the Supreme Court
*  ban affirmative action.
*  It's a moment you and a lot of other people have been eagerly awaiting because we're all
*  curious what the effects of this decision will actually be.
*  So what have you seen so far?
*  It's been fascinating.
*  So as you said, this is the first year of students who are coming after the Supreme
*  Court decision in 2023 that said colleges cannot continue to use the kind of race-based
*  affirmative action that they used before.
*  And really what that meant is that students were checking a box about their race.
*  And in order to make up for underrepresentation in the past, colleges were basically giving
*  what they call a tip to black applicants, Hispanic applicants, and Native applicants.
*  And the Supreme Court said you can't do that anymore.
*  You can take into account students' life experiences, including race, on an individual level, but
*  you can't give these broad advantages to different groups in the process.
*  And people care about this, even though it's at a relatively small number of schools, because
*  these schools confer big economic advantages on the people who go there, according to recent
*  economic research.
*  And they disproportionately create the American elite.
*  Senators and Supreme Court justices and CEOs disproportionately come from these several
*  dozen schools.
*  And so the first of these schools to report the demographics for the new freshman class
*  these are the classes that have just arrived on college campuses in the last few weeks,
*  was MIT.
*  And they reported this really big decline in the number of black students.
*  It had been 15% last year.
*  It's 5% this year in the first year class.
*  And a decline in the number of Hispanic students from 16% down to 11%.
*  The number of Asian students went up significantly, and the number of white students remained
*  roughly constant.
*  So this is basically a scenario that a lot of different people predicted, right?
*  Defenders of affirmative action said after the decision came down that the share of black
*  and Latino students would likely plummet, and critics of affirmative action predicted
*  that the share of Asian students would likely rise because affirmative action had suppressed
*  their numbers.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And so it looked like, oh my goodness, we're going to have this result that fits this neat
*  story that we're going to see black and Hispanic enrollment plummeting at all of these elite
*  schools and potentially Asian enrollment surging.
*  Because that was the picture at the first school to report.
*  And there was at least one other school that had results that resembled MIT's.
*  Amherst College, which is a highly selective college in Massachusetts, also reported meaningful
*  declines.
*  The share of black students went from 15% last year to 6% this year.
*  The percentage of Hispanic students went from 12% last year to 8% this year.
*  But it turns out, as we've gotten more schools reporting numbers, and even as we've dug a
*  little bit into MIT's and Amherst's numbers, the picture's gotten a lot more complicated.
*  Complicated how?
*  Well, there are several schools where the share of black students remained almost exactly
*  the same.
*  So at Duke, the share of black students this year held steady at 13%, same as last year.
*  At Yale, it held steady at 14%.
*  At Princeton, it also held steady in the same range.
*  And even at some of the schools that have reported big declines in the number of black
*  students like MIT, the numbers may exaggerate how big the decline actually was.
*  And that's because at several of these schools at MIT, a student who is multiracial counts
*  in more than one category.
*  So when you see the share of both black and Hispanic students falling, there might be
*  a single student who counts in both of those declines.
*  And look, at several of these schools, including MIT, the black and Hispanic share definitely
*  did fall.
*  It just may not have fallen as much in real human terms as some of those numbers suggested
*  that it did.
*  And I want to emphasize that we're still really early in this reporting cycle.
*  And I'm confident from talking to people that schools are going to be all over the map.
*  They're not all going to be like MIT, or they're not all going to be like Duke.
*  But I don't think we yet know the mix of how many schools are going to remain roughly similar
*  and how many are going to have big declines.
*  And we're just going to need more time to find that out.
*  OK, so clearly there is quite a lot of variation in this data.
*  But just from what you're telling me, it seems like the share of black students at least
*  overall is down.
*  It sounds like at best it's kind of stable for now, but in some places it actually dropped.
*  So is that a pattern you're seeing here?
*  I think that is a pattern.
*  And once more schools report, I think that's what we're going to end up seeing.
*  The trends with Hispanic students, though, are a little different.
*  Hispanic students are even more all over the map in terms of the trends.
*  So there are schools like MIT where the share of Hispanic students fell.
*  There are schools like Princeton and Yale where the share held roughly steady.
*  But we even have an example so far among just a very few schools that have reported of a
*  school where the percentage of Hispanic students rose, which is UVA.
*  It's gone from 8% to 10% in one year.
*  That's a meaningful increase.
*  So one of the things I will be watching going forward as more schools report is, is the
*  Hispanic share overall kind of holding steady, which seems plausible, or is it declining,
*  which also seems plausible.
*  But there's another point to think about here.
*  So far, Katrin, we've been talking about race.
*  But if you look at economic data, it looks like the number of lower income students at
*  many of these colleges is actually going up.
*  So I'll give you two interesting examples, Duke and UVA.
*  Duke is private.
*  UVA is public.
*  These are historically two of the least economically diverse colleges in America.
*  I wrote a whole story for our magazine about how dominated Duke was by upper income students.
*  And UVA, the University of Virginia, has long been arguably the least diverse public college
*  in America.
*  And yet, we've really seen increases in economic diversity.
*  So UVA reported that the percentage of students who received the Pell Grant, which is the
*  largest financial aid program in the country, basically goes to people in the bottom half
*  of the income distribution.
*  The Pell share at UVA rose from 16 to 24 over the last year.
*  At Duke, it rose from 17 to 22.
*  And we're going to need more information to figure out exactly what's going on here, because
*  the federal government did expand eligibility for the Pell Grant, which might explain a
*  couple ticks of that increase.
*  But it really seems like that a lot of these places, economic diversity has risen over the past year.
*  I mean, it's really fascinating.
*  What you're basically saying is that one year after the Supreme Court banned affirmative
*  action, broadly speaking, we're seeing racial diversity decreasing, but economic diversity
*  actually seems to have gone up.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And that's not a pattern that many people would necessarily have expected.
*  And it's a fascinating pattern.
*  And that, of course, raises the question of why is that happening?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, David, I want to dig a little deeper into this, frankly, surprising finding that we
*  discussed in the first half.
*  Why is it that post-affirmative action, economic diversity, has gone up at these schools?
*  Well, one thing that seems to be happening is that the number of upper income Black and
*  Hispanic and multiracial students at some of these schools, like MIT, has declined.
*  And to some extent, at some of these schools, they have been replaced by lower income students
*  of many races, potentially including lower income Black students and lower income Asian
*  and white students.
*  And the reason that would be is that the Supreme Court said you can no longer take into
*  account simply a student's race.
*  But the Supreme Court also said that colleges can very much continue to take into account
*  students' life experiences.
*  And so the main way that they would hear about students' experiences would be the essays.
*  So if a student wrote about how they grew up in a neighborhood that was lower income,
*  maybe an overwhelmingly Black or overwhelmingly Hispanic neighborhood, and they faced racial
*  discrimination, or maybe they grew up in a lower income, overwhelmingly Asian neighborhood
*  and faced racial discrimination, the colleges can take all those into account.
*  And so in this more subjective process in which students have to talk about themselves
*  as individuals rather than checking a box, you can imagine why these highly selective
*  colleges who can choose among incredibly large numbers of fantastically talented students,
*  why some of them might be admitting more low income kids who can talk about their experiences
*  with disadvantage and discrimination and admitting fewer kids who benefited from the old version
*  of affirmative action, but who also come from higher income neighborhoods and more advantaged
*  high schools.
*  And if that is what colleges are doing, you could understand why the number of low income
*  students may be going up, even as the number of Black and Hispanic students might be either
*  holding steady or going down.
*  So in other words, the sort of stronger focus on these application essays, which surface
*  the stories of overcoming have kind of helped to lead to more socioeconomic diversity in
*  these classes, because overcoming adversity isn't necessarily a racial issue.
*  Overcoming adversity absolutely can include race in the United States, given our racial
*  inequities and given racial discrimination, but it's not only race.
*  David, I just want to gut check here.
*  Now that affirmative action is no longer on the table, can we just assume that colleges
*  are still trying to maintain the same degree of racial diversity?
*  In other words, are students still encouraged to share their stories of growing up as a
*  minority in these essays?
*  Well that's a fascinating question.
*  If you ask colleges, they would have to say by the letter of the law that racial diversity
*  for its own sake is not something that we are emphasizing or considering in our application
*  process.
*  But we know that these colleges, and they've said this, they believe deeply in the value
*  of racial diversity.
*  They think it produces better education for their students.
*  They think it means that the students who are on campus, who are not from one of the
*  largest groups, don't feel alone.
*  So they care a lot about it.
*  But your question is also scraping at something interesting here, which is there are certainly
*  conservatives and opponents of affirmative action who are worried that schools are going
*  to cheat, who are worried that schools are going to say, we are taking into account the
*  students' individual experience.
*  But actually the schools often have ways of knowing a student's race, whether it's from
*  the essay or from other information in an application.
*  And there are certainly conservatives who are worried that schools are basically going
*  to try to hit their exact diversity targets as before for the sake of it.
*  Schools, meanwhile, are very worried about being sued.
*  And so I think that we can expect conservative legal activists, the same folks who brought
*  the lawsuits that led to the Supreme Court decision, to be scouring this data and potentially
*  filing suit against schools that report very similar numbers as in the past and accusing
*  them of still taking into account race while pretending not to.
*  We are almost certainly going to see more legal fights over this issue.
*  But one of the interesting things here, David, is that in order to comply with the ban on
*  race-based affirmative action, it seems that some of these colleges might actually be looking
*  at class as a proxy for race, presumably in the hope that selecting for a more economically
*  diverse class would also lead to more racial diversity.
*  But that doesn't totally seem to be working out.
*  Yes, I think they are using class in part as a proxy for race.
*  But you're absolutely right.
*  There is no perfect proxy for race in the United States of America.
*  Our racial gaps are just too big.
*  So even if colleges leaned heavily into economic affirmative action, they really might not
*  be able to replicate the percentage, particularly of Black and Native students, that they had
*  before affirmative action was outlawed by the Supreme Court.
*  Now, even if they can't absolutely replicate the shares that they had before, I do think
*  the evidence suggests that colleges can be significantly more broad-minded about economic
*  affirmative action in a way that has a very strong argument that it is fair and may also
*  lift racial diversity.
*  And what I mean by that is that when people think of economic diversity, sometimes they
*  think of it just narrowly by income.
*  But colleges can take into account many factors besides income.
*  They can take into account many of the factors that we know have huge racial gaps in this
*  society.
*  They can take into account wealth, and the wealth gap by race in our country is bigger
*  than the income gap.
*  They can take into account neighborhood poverty.
*  They can take into account the kind of high schools that students go to.
*  I think there's a very strong argument that they should be taking these factors into account.
*  I mean, if a student is growing up in a high poverty high school with a family that has
*  a very low network, those factors really do affect the student's ability to do schoolwork.
*  That student is running with wind in her face.
*  And so one of the things we hear from colleges is that they are trying to think about disadvantage
*  in this broader way than they were before the affirmative action decision.
*  So are there any concrete examples of schools doing what you're saying, you know, looking
*  at socioeconomic factors in this broader way?
*  Yeah, there are a few.
*  So one thing that multiple schools are using is a tool from the College Board.
*  The College Board is the organization that gives the SAT and gives the AP exams.
*  And the College Board gives colleges a dashboard so that the colleges can see not only what
*  are a student's scores, but what is the context in which that student is coming from.
*  So these AP tests, for example, the top score you can get is five.
*  Now if you get a four coming from a top high school, that means one thing.
*  But if you come from a high school where you're the only student who managed to get a four
*  on a given AP exam, that's really impressive.
*  And colleges are then able to take into account, look, it looks like this student can do the
*  work at our college.
*  And this student is one of the very, very best students in his or her community.
*  That's one example.
*  A second example is recruitment.
*  A bunch of these colleges are doing more to go to neighborhoods and high schools that
*  have historically not sent many kids to those colleges and try to do more to encourage students
*  to apply.
*  UVA, the University of Virginia, is a specific example.
*  They have launched this program called All Virginia.
*  And it seems like it may have made a difference.
*  The Black Share at UVA fell, but not much.
*  It fell from 11% to 9%.
*  And some of the other schools that have seen their Black Share hold steady are also doing
*  these recruitment efforts.
*  And then a third thing is money.
*  A whole bunch of schools are out there trying to raise money from their alumni and others
*  specifically to pay for financial aid.
*  And they're often being very upfront about this.
*  They are saying, hey, give us money so we can afford to enroll more students who don't
*  pay tuition or who don't pay much tuition.
*  And that can also help with racial diversity.
*  So if schools are really committed, that's what I'm hearing you say, and they put in
*  a lot of intentional effort and a lot of money, they can potentially achieve a level of both
*  economic diversity and racial diversity without necessarily violating the affirmative action
*  ban.
*  Yes.
*  And we do have some history here.
*  In several states, race-based affirmative action has been illegal for a long time, more
*  than 20 years.
*  California, Texas, these are big states.
*  And the state law said race-based affirmative action is not OK.
*  And so if you look at what the selective colleges in those states did, one of the things you
*  notice is this isn't a simple before and after.
*  Colleges need time to figure out what kind of programs they want to put in place that
*  might make a difference.
*  And so if you look at California, for example, it is absolutely the case that the number
*  of Black students in particular at the most selective University of California campuses,
*  which are Berkeley and UCLA, fell a lot right after California banned affirmative action.
*  And it is true that Berkeley has really struggled to recover the share of Black students that
*  it had before the law changed.
*  But UCLA, which is essentially as selective as Berkeley, has made much more progress.
*  25 years ago, the share of Black students at UCLA was about 3%.
*  Today, it's closer to 7%, which isn't that different from the share of Black residents
*  of California.
*  And so what you see is we are going to have variation.
*  There are some schools that are going to be able to maintain diversity better than others.
*  And it isn't the case that these first year of numbers we see are necessarily going to
*  be the new reality that lasts forever.
*  There are going to be new versions of UCLA, schools where diversity initially falls, but
*  then starts to rebound as they figure out ways to recruit a wide variety of students.
*  OK, so there seems to be a model of what schools need to do in order to maintain or at least
*  raise diversity from the kind of plummeting after a ban has happened.
*  But what happens if schools won't or can't put in these resources?
*  I think it really depends on what group we're talking about.
*  I think if you're talking about Hispanic students, there is real reason to be optimistic over
*  the long term.
*  So let's look at UCLA again.
*  In 1999, the share of Hispanic students at UCLA was 13%.
*  Today, the share of Hispanic students entering UCLA is 24%.
*  It has risen really quickly, even without affirmative action in California.
*  And that's because of much broader trends.
*  There's been a whole lot of research tracking the outcomes of immigrants.
*  It's been part of this recent big data revolution in economics in which researchers can study
*  millions of tax records and census records and get a sense for families' trajectories
*  over time.
*  And what it shows is that not only Asian families, but also Hispanic families, immigrant families,
*  are doing extremely well.
*  When you look at measures like education and income, the recent immigrants, both Asian
*  and Hispanic, are very much following the trajectory of earlier generations of immigrants,
*  the Italian families and Irish families and Jewish families from a century ago.
*  Immigrants themselves often remain poor for their lives, but their children do so much
*  better.
*  They become more educated, they make more money, and their grandchildren do even better
*  yet.
*  And that's the trajectory that so many Asian and Hispanic families are on in this country.
*  And so when you think about that larger reality, it means that perhaps colleges need to worry
*  a little bit less about what their enrollment of Hispanic students are going forward, even
*  with this decision.
*  I think the story starts to become very different when you're talking about groups that have
*  experienced centuries of discrimination and oppression in this country.
*  And that is specifically Black Americans and Native Americans.
*  And of course, the whole point of affirmative action from the outset was to correct for
*  racial injustice in America, basically to help right those historic wrongs like slavery.
*  So how should we be thinking about that original goal now?
*  That's a vital point, Katrin.
*  When affirmative action started, basically in the Kennedy and then LBJ administrations
*  in the 1960s, it was not a broad program to help all racial minorities, so much as it
*  was a program specifically to help Black Americans.
*  The population at the time was less diverse, the American population was overwhelmingly
*  either white or Black.
*  And the idea of affirmative action was to deal not only with the legacy of slavery,
*  but also the legacy of the racially discriminatory laws that we had well into the 20th century,
*  into the second half of the 20th century, that helped white people buy homes, but wouldn't
*  help Black people buy homes.
*  These are legacies we still live with today.
*  One of the reasons that Black families are less wealthy than white families is because
*  we have had government policies that have specifically tried to lift the net worth of
*  white families and excluded Black families.
*  And so given this incredible legacy of discrimination, and given the fact that immigrants of all
*  groups traditionally have all kinds of advantages for a complicated mix of reasons, the thing
*  that I particularly will be looking at is what happens to the share of Black students
*  and Native students at many of these schools.
*  I think those are the areas, given the legacies of racial discrimination in this country,
*  particularly for Native and Black people, that are much more worrisome than what happens
*  over the long term to the share of Hispanic or Asian or white students at these schools.
*  And is there room, in the light of this sort of ruling that came down a year ago, to design
*  a more targeted remedy specifically addressing this particular historic injustice?
*  I don't know.
*  And I think it's a great question.
*  There was a fascinating discussion during the Supreme Court arguments over this case
*  about whether, for example, a college could consider whether an applicant came from a
*  family that had been enslaved.
*  And Justice Kavanaugh, who of course is a Republican appointee, suggested that he might
*  be open to such a policy.
*  Now it was a brief conversation, and I don't know whether you could, but that's a really
*  tricky question, right?
*  Because the notion of did you have an ancestor who was enslaved is not a question about race.
*  But of course, in the United States, we know that that is referring to only one race.
*  And so you can imagine, particularly if the numbers of Black students look really worrisome
*  in coming years, that colleges might try to get more aggressive about those kinds of questions.
*  But it is certainly something that would have to be the subject of future legal cases.
*  So David, as we're coming to the end of this episode, it just strikes me that race-based
*  affirmative action, which was supposed to address racial injustice, actually kind of
*  failed on the economic piece of that inequity.
*  And now in this post-affirmative action world, we're seeing some progress on the economic
*  injustice front, but on the racial component, these colleges may actually be going backwards.
*  Yes, that is right.
*  And it's a sign of how complicated this entire subject is.
*  I think one thing to keep in mind is it's not as if the system before the Supreme Court's
*  decision was working particularly well from anyone's perspective.
*  So conservatives, of course, were unhappy with the system with racial categories.
*  That's how we got the case.
*  And it's how we got a conservative Supreme Court saying, you can't use these racial boxes.
*  But the old system was also not that easy to defend on progressive values.
*  I mean, several years ago, multiple elite colleges had more students coming from the
*  top 1% of families based on income than the entire bottom 60%.
*  So kind of affirmative action for the rich, actually.
*  Yes.
*  And the idea that these colleges that are supposed to be meritocracies had more students
*  from the top 1% than from the entire bottom 60% is very hard to defend with any set of
*  progressive values.
*  And now we have a new system.
*  And it seems as if this new system may increase economic diversity, just as you were saying.
*  It also has the potential to decrease racial diversity and aggravate racial inequality
*  in a country where racial inequality is a deep and abiding problem.
*  And so as we think about this going forward, I think we're likely to end up with a set
*  of changes that aren't simply good or simply bad from the perspective of any political ideology.
*  I think we're instead likely to end up with a mix in which whatever your views are, you're
*  probably going to look at this system a few years from now and say, hmm, it changed in
*  some ways that are problematic, and it changed in some ways that are positive.
*  And over time, the colleges are going to try to increase the positives and decrease the
*  problematic aspects of it.
*  Well, David, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Katrin.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in Los Angeles, signaling
*  the final stages of a five-year investigation into the president's son.
*  Hunter Biden had been bankrolling his drug and alcohol addiction by leveraging his name
*  to win overseas consulting contracts while not paying his taxes.
*  His guilty plea was not part of a plea deal.
*  He now faces a prison sentence of up to 17 years or a fine of up to $1.3 million, on
*  top of the possible sentence of 25 years after being convicted of lying on a firearms application
*  in Delaware in June.
*  And President Vladimir Putin of Russia amplified his threats against Ukraine's eastern Donbass
*  region, calling Moscow's offensive in the area his military's, quote, first priority
*  goal.
*  Speaking at an international conference in Vladivostok, Putin tried to portray his army's
*  grueling push into eastern Ukraine as evidence of a failed Ukrainian military strategy.
*  He dismissed Ukraine's capture of hundreds of square miles of Russian territory in the
*  Kursk region as little more than a distraction that would be dealt with over time.
*  Remember to catch a new episode of the interview right here tomorrow.
*  This week, David Marchese interviews Will Ferrell and his friend and fellow comedian
*  Harper Steele.
*  Not long ago, Steele came out as trans, and the two have now released a documentary about
*  that.
*  I said to Harper, what if we went on a road trip?
*  I went with you and we film it.
*  And I'll be kind of like your offensive lineman, so to speak.
