# Nuclear Secrets and Taped Conversations: A Look at the Evidence Against Trump.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymG8CecjciQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Good afternoon.
*  Today, an indictment was unsealed, charging Donald J. Trump with felony violations of
*  our national security laws, as well as participating in a conspiracy to obstruct justice.
*  On Friday, when the federal indictment of Donald Trump over his handling of classified
*  materials was finally unsealed.
*  We got a glimpse into just how strong the government's legal case against him will
*  actually be.
*  Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of
*  the United States, and they must be enforced.
*  Today, my colleague Ben Protest walks us through the evidence.
*  We have one set of laws in this country, and they apply to everyone.
*  It's Monday, June 12th.
*  Ben, I want to recap for you where we were as of Friday morning, which is when we published
*  our last episode about all of this.
*  At that point, we understood that Donald Trump had been indicted over his handling of classified
*  materials and that the charges involved obstructing the federal government's efforts to retrieve
*  those documents.
*  But the indictment itself had not yet been made public.
*  So there was a lot we still didn't really understand.
*  So I wonder if you can pick up the story from there.
*  Yeah, so on Friday, we actually get the indictment, the thing we've been waiting for, and it's
*  a doozy.
*  I mean, we've got 37 counts laid out in 49 pages.
*  Many of the counts relate to his willful retention of the documents.
*  He actually removed them from the White House.
*  And then several of the counts relate to his refusal to return them or his obstruction
*  of the investigation.
*  And the indictment just sort of lays out the evidence, much of it seemingly pretty damning
*  in this great detail.
*  Well, let's talk about all that detail.
*  And I think we should organize it in a few different ways, given what we already know
*  about the case.
*  So let's talk about the indictment in terms of first, what does it tell us about the nature
*  of these classified materials that Trump took, which has always been a little bit of a mystery.
*  And then second, what we learned about exactly how and where Trump stored these classified
*  materials during this period where he wouldn't return them.
*  And third, the specific ways the indictment alleges that he tried to obstruct the government
*  from ever getting the documents back.
*  All right, let's bite these off one at a time, Michael.
*  So the indictment says that when he leaves the White House, he takes documents related
*  to some of our nation's most important agencies.
*  So we're talking the CIA, NSA, State Department, Defense, and some of the documents that are
*  in the indictment that are cited that he took.
*  These are things related to the military capabilities of a foreign country, one document that relates
*  to the nuclear capability of a foreign country, one document concerned the military contingency
*  planning of the United States, and yet another concerned nuclear weaponry of the United States.
*  I mean, I just want to linger on one of the documents you just mentioned, Ben.
*  Nuclear weaponry of the United States.
*  Donald Trump took a document from the White House that in some way or another detailed
*  the United States nuclear capacities.
*  Correct.
*  And these are documents that, according to the indictment, left the White House and went
*  down to Florida with him.
*  Listen, the former president and his supporters have tried to portray this as just a few innocent
*  documents.
*  They're his documents.
*  He had the right to do this and nothing to see here.
*  But that's just not the case, at least not as it's laid out in the indictment.
*  Right.
*  So in no way is this the story of Trump taking a set of kind of harmless mementos, right?
*  Like a personal letter from the prime minister of a foreign country or some treaty he signed
*  that later became public.
*  Like you're saying, just kind of almost incomprehensibly top secret stuff.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So I think, Ben, this quite naturally brings us to the second category of information in
*  the indictment, which is what it tells us about how Trump treated these ultra sensitive
*  documents given what the contents of them are.
*  So what exactly does the indictment tell us about that?
*  Well, it tells us that he was pretty careless with where he put them.
*  So picture yourself walking into former president's club Mar-a-Lago down in Florida and you see
*  boxes and boxes of documents.
*  Now, some of them are kept in a storage room.
*  Some of these boxes, though, were not.
*  They were in a ballroom, a bathroom, a shower, even a shower, a shower.
*  Yeah.
*  Remember, these are top secret documents, right?
*  But what the indictment shows is that they're kind of just put in random places without
*  any real security.
*  And in the indictment, you can see that Trump's aides are texting each other back and forth.
*  What do we do with these documents?
*  At one point, you've got one employee writing to another.
*  There's still a little room left in the shower where the other stuff is.
*  I think there was just so little, according to the indictment, so little care given to
*  where to store these records that they were just sort of everywhere all across Mar-a-Lago.
*  So these aides, they're just treating them as the president's stuff and therefore putting
*  them wherever they find space, including some very strange places to put classified
*  documents like a bathroom, a shower, a ballroom stage.
*  Right.
*  And what the indictment tells us is that he didn't just keep them in strange places.
*  He also shared them in some strange ways as well.
*  Okay, explain that.
*  So there are two potentially alarming examples that the indictment recites.
*  The first is when Trump shared a highly sensitive, quote unquote, plan of attack against Iran
*  to visitors at his golf club in Bedminster.
*  This is in New Jersey and this is happening back in July of 2021.
*  So he takes documents from Mar-a-Lago to another Trump club, this time in New Jersey.
*  Correct.
*  Packed them up, put them on the plane and flew to Bedminster and is at his club and
*  is being interviewed for a book.
*  And so there's a recording that's going on here.
*  It's on tape and the investigators have this recording.
*  They have Trump in his own words describing a document that he has as highly confidential
*  and in his word, secret.
*  Now what's really notable here is that he admits that he could have declassified it
*  when he was president, but that he didn't.
*  And that this was secret information that was now being shared.
*  And you can kind of hear apparently on the tape, according to the indictment, one of
*  his aides in the background saying something to the effect of, oh no, now we have a problem.
*  Fascinating.
*  You get from this tape very clear evidence that Trump, and it sounds like an aide close
*  by, both understand that showing this document to the people in this room at Bedminster is
*  illegal, because they don't have the right credentials, the right clearance to see this
*  stuff.
*  Certainly that's the case that's made in the indictment.
*  And I'm always hesitant to say what he knew was illegal or didn't know was illegal.
*  But certainly what the indictment is laying out there is you're establishing his knowledge
*  of the law.
*  One of his central defenses all along is that, oh, I declassified these.
*  These documents were mine.
*  I declassified them.
*  But you have them literally on tape saying, no, I didn't declassify this and I could have.
*  And I'm not one to judge what a smoking gun is, but I bet prosecutors feel that that
*  recording is as close as you're going to get.
*  Ben, what's the second example of Trump showing a classified document to someone in a way
*  that feels pretty alarming?
*  So he also shared a top secret map, a military map with a staff member as political action
*  committee is PAC.
*  And that person, according to the indictment, did not have a security clearance.
*  And so it sort of describes how Trump quickly realizes that maybe he shouldn't have been
*  displaying that.
*  And he tells this person, wait, don't, no, don't get too close.
*  Ben, does this indictment at all hint at why Trump would share these highly classified
*  documents with super secret information, despite knowing, as he appeared to know in both cases,
*  that he shouldn't?
*  Or are we kind of just left to speculate that doing this scratches a pretty well known Trump
*  itch for showing things off and kind of relishing in the power and access and importance he
*  has?
*  So the indictment need not get into the motive.
*  But in talking this over with some of our colleagues, Maggie Haberman, especially, there's
*  definitely that itch that you noted correctly that he has to show off and to feel important.
*  He had just been burned and lost the election.
*  And having these documents surely made him feel powerful and important.
*  But there's another itch that he has to scratch sometimes, right, which is settling old scores.
*  So take, for instance, the Iran document that he was waving around at Bedminster and that
*  they recorded him talking about.
*  What you have there is Trump was locked in this feud in his mind with a former high level
*  official Mark Milley.
*  And Milley was getting all this good press for being a check on Trump and potentially
*  saving him from attacking Iran and other countries.
*  And Trump was seething.
*  And Trump felt like this document, which I guess sort of claimed was Milley's attack
*  plan against Iran, was going to exonerate Trump and was going to be, in his own words,
*  according to the recording, it's in the indictment, was going to prove his case for him.
*  And so, yes, certainly it's the ego stroking.
*  But there's also that ability for some of these documents in his mind to sort of help
*  him settle old scores and beat back his enemies.
*  So in Trump's mind, producing a highly classified document and being able to show it to someone
*  in the room with him was just another way to get the best of someone, settle a score,
*  prove he was right, the kind of thing he might do with any document on his desk.
*  But in this case, these happen to be the kind of documents that you're not supposed to do
*  that with.
*  Bingo.
*  But how important to the charges that have just been brought against Trump in this case
*  is this behavior we're talking about, the original taking of the documents, given how
*  classified they are and the showing of the documents to people who didn't have the clearance.
*  Sure, it's important.
*  But if you read through the indictment as you keep going through this sweeping document,
*  you sort of get the sense that it's just the tip of the iceberg.
*  Much of what's alleged is Trump's effort to obstruct the investigation or refuse to return
*  the documents.
*  And so you get the sense that the government feels and some of the experts we're talking
*  to feel that that is perhaps the most serious part of the indictment.
*  The cover up.
*  So then let's turn to this question of obstruction.
*  What does this indictment allege about Trump's efforts to hide these classified materials
*  from the government once the government asks for them all back?
*  Sure.
*  So if you think of it, it all sort of flows from the subpoena that he got back in May
*  of last year, May of 2022.
*  And so he gets a subpoena from the FBI and Justice Department basically saying, we want
*  you to turn over all these classified documents that you have, whatever you have, turn them
*  over.
*  Right.
*  And this is already a point at which the government thinks you haven't given us everything, even
*  though we've asked.
*  So now we're giving you a subpoena.
*  So you now have to turn things over.
*  That's what the subpoena means.
*  Exactly.
*  The subpoena means they had just convened a grand jury beginning a criminal investigation.
*  And so now they're going to make a good faith attempt to recover the documents via subpoena.
*  OK.
*  So what does the indictment say happens once the subpoena arrives?
*  So instead of just turning them over, he first meets his lawyer, his new lawyer, a person
*  by the name of Evan Corcoran.
*  And Mr. Corcoran goes down to Mar-a-Lago and right off the bat, Trump says to him, I just
*  don't really feel the need to comply with the subpoena in essence.
*  So he says things like, I don't want anybody looking.
*  I don't want anybody looking through my boxes.
*  I really don't.
*  I don't even want you looking through my boxes.
*  And then he sort of suggests things to Mr. Corcoran, his attorney, things like, what
*  happens if we just don't respond at all or just don't play ball with them?
*  And then he asked the question, wouldn't it be better if we just told them we didn't have
*  anything here?
*  Which is sure, except that that's illegal.
*  You have to respond to a lawful grand jury subpoena.
*  You can either comply with it or you can move to quash it.
*  But you can't just tell the government a lie that you don't have anything there.
*  So Trump realizes his lawyer will comply with the subpoena and is going to turn over any
*  documents he knows about and finds to the government.
*  So then according to the indictment, Trump directs his employee, Walt Nata, who's also
*  charged in the indictment as a co-conspirator, to move boxes out of the storage room where
*  Corcoran was just about to look.
*  So in the days and the weeks leading up to Corcoran's visit to search for those documents,
*  Trump directs Nata to move these boxes.
*  And we're not just talking about one or two boxes.
*  Ultimately, it's 64 boxes that Nata moves out.
*  So despite all the moving of those boxes, Mr. Corcoran does still find about 38 documents
*  that have classified markings.
*  Wow.
*  Now, Mr. Corcoran doesn't have security clearance to hold on to them or to view them really.
*  So Trump sort of suggests he take them back to his hotel room.
*  And this is one of the more bizarre parts of the indictment.
*  According to Mr. Corcoran, Mr. Trump makes a sort of a plucking gesture.
*  If you can sort of imagine your hand dipping into a document and like plucking it out of
*  a box, which Mr. Corcoran says is sort of like, well, okay, why don't you take them
*  back to your hotel room?
*  And if there's anything sort of really bad in there, you know, sort of just just pluck
*  it out.
*  That's the that's the motion he made.
*  Just just sort of pluck it out.
*  So then I just want to make sure I'm understanding this.
*  Trump has already hidden key classified documents from this lawyer.
*  But when the lawyer eventually does find some limited number of documents that are
*  classified and talks to Trump about it, Trump goes further and says, I want you to go
*  through those classified documents and pluck out anything that seems like a problem for
*  me legally.
*  And then you can turn over what's left to the government.
*  Correct. And so you can't just pluck out bad or incriminating information in response
*  to a subpoena. You have to turn over everything.
*  Right. And that's why it's such an important part of the indictment.
*  OK. And then what should we make of the fact that the lawyer in this case clearly has
*  offered testimony against his client?
*  That would seem to be how we know that these conversations occur.
*  Usually they would be covered by attorney client privilege.
*  Right. Yeah, it's a great question.
*  So what happened is the government early this year decided to make an argument that
*  they were able to see Mr.
*  Corcoran's notes and to be able to secure the testimony from Mr.
*  Corcoran, even though it was covered normally by attorney client privilege.
*  And that's because there is a notable exception to attorney client privilege, which is
*  the crime fraud exception.
*  And basically what that means is if a client is using his or her lawyer to further a
*  crime and the government can make a showing of that, then prosecutors can absolutely
*  pierce the privilege. If a judge agrees in this case, sure enough, a judge agreed that Mr.
*  Trump was trying to use Mr.
*  Corcoran to further his crime.
*  That allowed them to access these notes that Mr.
*  Corcoran made and ultimately secure his testimony as well.
*  Got it. So according to the indictment, what happens next in this alleged scheme to
*  obstruct the government's retrieval of these documents?
*  Sure. So what happens after Mr.
*  Corcoran produces these 38 additional documents is the government has reason to believe
*  that that's not it. And so they actually get surveillance footage of the property of
*  Mar-a-Lago and they see that people are moving boxes in and out and they start interviewing
*  witnesses and they figure out absolutely things were moved in and out and perhaps it was
*  just a drop in the bucket what had already been turned over.
*  And so they ultimately go to a judge and get a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago last August.
*  And there's this sort of extraordinary scene of former president's private residence being
*  searched by a team of FBI agents.
*  And this is sort of what alerted the world that this was not just some back and forth
*  or discussion about documents, but a real live serious criminal investigation.
*  And at that search, they sure enough find over 100 additional classified documents.
*  So then this FBI search, which we all watched more or less in real time, it was a huge event.
*  It's kind of the culmination of this scheme that, according to the indictment, Trump has
*  been up to. He has hidden documents from his lawyer.
*  He has asked his lawyer to pluck things out.
*  He has asked an aide to move boxes and hide things from his lawyer and the government.
*  And when the government shows up in this raid and starts looking around, what it finds is
*  the in some ways successful for Trump result of all that scheming.
*  He has kept dozens and dozens of classified documents.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Then the volume and the strength of the evidence that you have just gone through and that is
*  contained in this indictment, it feels very meaningful.
*  So do legal experts that you and our colleagues have been talking to, do they see this as
*  a strong case?
*  Yeah. So most of the experts we're talking to would say that this is a very comprehensive
*  indictment. It establishes in their minds his knowledge of the law.
*  And that he had retained these documents and tried to obstruct the investigation, that
*  there's a tremendous amount of evidence, both from documents, witness interviews, tapes.
*  So while no case is perfect, I think a lot of the experts reactions to this indictment is
*  that it's pretty strong.
*  Got it. And Ben, do we have any sense of what Trump's defense might look like yet?
*  Well, originally, his defense was that he had declassified these documents and that they
*  were his documents.
*  Obviously, that's going to be undermined by the recording they have of him at Bedminster.
*  We're going to learn, I'm sure in the coming weeks and months, what his substantive legal
*  defense is going to be.
*  And he recently just switched legal teams in this case.
*  So we don't quite know just yet.
*  Rhetorically, his defense is going to be that this is a continuation of the witch hunt from
*  previous impeachments, that it's all the Democrats that are trying to get him, basically.
*  So is it fair to say that this case is looking like it very well could result in a
*  conviction?
*  Well, not so fast.
*  I think there are a lot of variables in a criminal proceeding.
*  And one of the things that's really important to keep in mind is whose courtroom the case
*  will be in. In this case, it's going to be in the courtroom of Judge Aileen Cannon.
*  And Judge Cannon was not only appointed by President Trump, but also she had ruled in
*  his favor in a related matter in this documents case last year.
*  And so at one point in this case, she effectively froze a portion of the government's
*  investigation.
*  I remember that.
*  Yeah, she sort of barred prosecutors from using the materials they had seized from
*  Mar-a-Lago.
*  And she ultimately was overturned by the appeals court.
*  But this was a big contentious matter and she showed some sympathy to the former
*  president's case.
*  So I think we just don't know yet how it's going to play out in her courtroom.
*  Ben, can the Department of Justice seek a different judge based on the impression that
*  she is a Trump ally?
*  Do we know if that's even possible or something that they're contemplating?
*  Well, actually, Michael, Jack Smith and his team made the decision to file this in the
*  Southern District of Florida.
*  That was their choice.
*  And in fact, everybody originally expected they were going to file it in Washington.
*  The grand jury had been sitting in Washington for almost a year.
*  And all of that frenzied and flurry of investigative activity was in Washington.
*  And then out of nowhere, a few weeks ago, the activity sort of shifted to Florida.
*  And presumably, the government felt they had to do that because so much of the alleged
*  misconduct that's in the indictment occurred in Florida.
*  And so they knew the risks of filing it down there.
*  And also, you could view it from their perspective of this case is so bulletproof that
*  we don't mind trying it in front of a judge who's been skeptical of us in the past.
*  Obviously, we just have to sort of see it play out.
*  Now, you also have to keep in mind that the jury pool down there is going to be a little
*  different than if they had filed it in Washington.
*  In Washington, you tend to get people who are government workers, people who are a
*  little more sympathetic to the prosecution's viewpoint, broadly speaking.
*  And generally speaking, you're going to have Democrats who are not huge supporters of
*  the former president. Right down in Florida, obviously a state he won twice is a very
*  different jury pool.
*  So all it takes is one juror, that more skeptical jury pool to balk and you have a
*  hung jury and the government would have to either forego its case or try it again
*  entirely new. So that is the potential wild card in all of this is who's sitting on
*  the jury and the judge who's overseeing the trial.
*  Right. And then that makes me think of the other Trump indictment that you have been
*  covering. You're now covering two.
*  And the first one was an indictment brought in Manhattan against Trump for falsifying
*  business records in an alleged hush money scheme.
*  And there, the widely held view is that the jury pool is unlikely to be sympathetic to
*  Trump, we think. Right.
*  So you could almost view these as sort of the inverse of each other.
*  So in Manhattan, you have a very sympathetic jury pool and a judge overseeing the case
*  that has appeared pretty skeptical of Trump in the past.
*  But you don't quite have that national security level of import of the case.
*  And that's not to undermine the significance of the hush money case.
*  It's just not at the national security level.
*  Right. In the special counsel's indictment that we are now reviewing, you have perhaps
*  a more skeptical jury pool and a more skeptical judge.
*  But you have this sort of heavyweight of a national security indictment.
*  Right. So arguably, the indictment that carries the national security implications and
*  that feels like this heavier weightier indictment could actually be the one that's a
*  little tougher to prove with that jury pool.
*  But you could also see in the middle of the election next year, two different trials,
*  both of which he's potentially convicted in, and he could be facing some very serious
*  prison time from both.
*  Well, Ben, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it. Thanks, Michael.
*  They want to use something called the espionage act.
*  Doesn't that sound terrible?
*  Oh, espionage.
*  We got a box. I got a box.
*  The espionage.
*  Over the weekend, in speeches delivered in Georgia and North Carolina, Trump mocked the
*  latest indictment against him, as well as the special counsel who carried out the
*  investigation at the heart of it.
*  Jack Smith deranged Jack Smith.
*  And I watched him yesterday go up and talk.
*  He talked for about two and a half minutes.
*  He was shaking. He was so scared he didn't want to be there.
*  In what is likely to be a major theme of his presidential campaign, Trump told his
*  supporters that the indictment was not about him, but about them.
*  Because in the end, they're not coming after me.
*  They're coming after you.
*  And I'm just standing in their way.
*  Here I am. I'm standing in their way.
*  And I always will be.
*  Trump is scheduled to be arraigned in Judge Cannon's Miami courtroom tomorrow afternoon.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Sunday, a section of Interstate 95, one of the busiest and most vital highways in
*  the country, collapsed in northeast Philadelphia after a tanker carrying gas caught fire
*  underneath it.
*  This is an emergency that has created a tremendous challenge for our transportation
*  network.
*  The collapse, which affected the interstate in both directions, will take months to repair
*  and is expected to disrupt traffic for hundreds of thousands of drivers throughout the
*  summer.
*  We are all going to need some extra patience in the coming days, especially tomorrow
*  morning.
*  Today's episode was produced by Alex Stern and Mina Feldman.
