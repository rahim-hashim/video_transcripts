# The Growing Danger of Measles
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Kim Seberson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=4.2s)]
*  A measles outbreak continues to spread in Texas, where more than 200 people have been infected, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=13.32s)]
*  one child has died, and health experts are now concerned that low vaccination rates will [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=19.26s)]
*  make it harder to contain. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  Today, my colleague Teddy Rosenblum takes us into the epicenter of the outbreak and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  explains whether its rapid spread and the government's response to it signals a turning [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=33.32s)]
*  point in how America views public health. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=38.72s)]
*  It's Wednesday, March 12th. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=48.0s)]
*  Teddy, welcome. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=55.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=57.24s)]
*  Like most people, I don't really think about measles being much of a threat. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=58.24s)]
*  You may hear about an outbreak, but it gets contained, we all move on. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=63.36s)]
*  This outbreak doesn't seem to be going away. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=68.12s)]
*  Can you lay out for me why it's different? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=71.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=73.84s)]
*  So, part of the reason that you probably don't think very much about measles, even though [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=74.84s)]
*  it's an incredibly contagious virus, is because it's vaccine preventable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=79.4s)]
*  It's been eliminated in the United States since 2000, which means there will be cases [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=84.72s)]
*  here and there, but it's not continuously spreading. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=89.5s)]
*  And so we've seen these other outbreaks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=92.8s)]
*  We saw one in New York, we saw one in Washington, but experts are looking at this outbreak a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=95.08s)]
*  little bit differently. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=101.12s)]
*  And that's because, one, a child has died, and two, because childhood vaccination rates [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=103.24s)]
*  have been falling for some time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=109.22s)]
*  And that fall really accelerated during the pandemic and just hasn't rebounded. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=111.56s)]
*  And so in some pockets of the United States, what we're seeing is that vaccination rates [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  for the measles mumps rubella vaccine, the MMR shot, have fallen far below where experts [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=121.88s)]
*  would want them to be. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=128.4s)]
*  And those pockets have multiplied and gotten bigger, really raising concerns that these [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=130.24s)]
*  Once isolated outbreaks are going to travel further and infect more people. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=136.44s)]
*  And that's what's happening in Texas, specifically, right? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  So walk me through this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  When did it start and where are we now? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=147.4s)]
*  So the first couple cases started popping up at the end of January. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=150.44s)]
*  And they were these kids who belonged to a very large Mennonite population that settled [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=155.4s)]
*  in West Texas in the 1970s. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=160.6s)]
*  In this population, there is no religious doctrine that says that they cannot be vaccinated. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=163.64s)]
*  But historically, they have had low vaccine uptake just because they don't interact with [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=169.2s)]
*  the medical system as often as the broader community. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=173.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  And as I understand, they're much more reliant on natural remedies. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=177.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes, a long tradition of holistic medicine, that sort of thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=180.04s)]
*  But the lack of vaccination uptake in that area sort of gives measles the oxygen that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=185.48s)]
*  it needs to spread rapidly through the community. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=191.4s)]
*  And so by the end of February, we saw more than 120 cases, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=195.16000000000003s)]
*  And then two months later, we're now up to more than 200 cases. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=199.44000000000003s)]
*  And now we're also seeing a separate but likely related outbreak in New Mexico in a county [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  that borders where this outbreak has been happening in Texas. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  And unfortunately, we've seen two deaths related to these outbreaks. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=214.84s)]
*  So I was really interested in seeing what an outbreak of measles looks like. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=222.24s)]
*  This is a virus that many people have never seen in their lifetimes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=228.56s)]
*  So I started to call some doctors, call some public health officials, and ultimately decided [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  to travel down there myself. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so you land in West Texas. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  Take me through how your trip started. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=244.84s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=247.8s)]
*  So maybe just at the scene a little bit, what West Texas is known for is, you know, four [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=249.24s)]
*  things. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  Cotton, peanuts, oil, and this big Mennonite community. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=256.32s)]
*  So I spent time at the hospital that serves this community, Seminole Memorial Hospital [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  in Gaines County, Texas, which is the epicenter of this big measles outbreak. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=270.12s)]
*  This is Dr. Parkey. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  I was shadowing Dr. Wendell Parkey, the director of the family clinic there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=280.76s)]
*  The kid may have headache or earaches because of the sinuses being swollen. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=285.32s)]
*  And at the clinic, they have divided their day into two. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  In the morning, they do all the wellness visits. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  They see the pregnant women, they do checks to make sure infants are healthy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=296.24s)]
*  And then at 1 p.m., sort of everything shifts. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=300.88s)]
*  The woman puts on N95 masks, and that's when they start seeing the measles cases. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=304.16s)]
*  And Dr. Parkey, who has worked in the area for almost three decades, he has not seen [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=311.6s)]
*  a measles case before this year. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=317.96s)]
*  He'd only seen it in medical textbooks. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=320.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=323.08s)]
*  But he has become very good at spotting these cases. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=324.08s)]
*  And it's not because of the rash, which you might think. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=328.3s)]
*  Literally, even if you didn't see the rash, you can look across the room and go, oh, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=330.56s)]
*  man, they don't look all frisky. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=335.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=337.04s)]
*  They look like they don't feel good. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=338.04s)]
*  It's because all of these kids come in with this very distinctive look. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=340.04s)]
*  It looks like they're staring, you know, 100 miles away. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=346.12s)]
*  Very vacant expression. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=349.88s)]
*  These kids are sick. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=350.96s)]
*  She has been very sick already. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=351.96s)]
*  And so I got to see this for myself with one patient, this eight-year-old girl in the room [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=354.64s)]
*  with her mom. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=359.28s)]
*  And this little girl did not speak any English. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=360.28s)]
*  She spoke low German, which is a regional dialect that many Mennonites speak. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=366.88s)]
*  So she had the rash like Wednesday or something? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=371.79999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=373.88s)]
*  It was Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=374.88s)]
*  You know, she was unvaccinated and recovering from a really nasty case of measles. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=375.88s)]
*  And she had that thousand yard stare. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=381.28s)]
*  And what is she usually like? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=383.88s)]
*  Is she usually energetic? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=387.76s)]
*  This is a little kid that you would expect to be bouncing around the room and bothering [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=389.56s)]
*  her mother. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=393.82s)]
*  And she was, you know, really not feeling well and not responding. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=394.82s)]
*  Can you lay down? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=398.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=401.04s)]
*  And at one point, they go and give her this injection in her thigh, which Dr. Parkey prescribed [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=402.44s)]
*  to help manage some of her symptoms. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=408.96s)]
*  And I'm looking at this needle and, you know, it's like two or three inches long. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=411.72s)]
*  Right there. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=416.72s)]
*  She didn't even cry. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=418.72s)]
*  No, she's crying. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  You're good. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  You're done. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  I want to put her bandage. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  And she just stares straight ahead. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=427.16s)]
*  It doesn't even flinch as that needle goes into her leg. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=429.72s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=433.68s)]
*  I have never seen a child who didn't react when they got a shot. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=438.36s)]
*  That poor kid must have been very sick. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=439.36s)]
*  Very. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=441.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=442.36s)]
*  Bitter, bitter. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=443.36s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=444.36s)]
*  So what's her trajectory? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=445.36s)]
*  So what's her trajectory? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=447.2s)]
*  Like what happens to a child who gets measles? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=448.88s)]
*  So the first symptoms that they'll probably experience, a runny nose, a cough, a fever, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=451.8s)]
*  you know, they get these crusty eyes that look a little red and irritated. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=458.88s)]
*  And then you start to develop that iconic measles rash, which is these flat red spots [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=464.02000000000004s)]
*  that start at the top of your body and spread downwards to cover your arms, your neck, your [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=470.56s)]
*  entire trunk. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=477.8s)]
*  And for most kids and adults, these symptoms will resolve within a few weeks. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=479.84s)]
*  But for some kids, measles can be really dangerous. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=485.68s)]
*  About one in 20 kids develop pneumonia, which makes it really difficult to get oxygen into [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=491.72s)]
*  the lungs. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=497.48s)]
*  Some kids have to be hospitalized, maybe even put on a ventilator. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=498.48s)]
*  One in a thousand kids get encephalitis, you know, swelling of the brain, which can cause [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=502.84000000000003s)]
*  permanent damage, blindness, deafness, intellectual disability. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=509.32s)]
*  And then of course, in rare cases, children can die. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=514.96s)]
*  Teddy, you spoke with the mother of the girl, the unvaccinated girl who didn't flinch when [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=518.56s)]
*  she got the shot, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=529.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=531.16s)]
*  Well, what was going through her mind? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=532.16s)]
*  So this is a woman who had vaccinated three of her children. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=534.1199999999999s)]
*  There was the third child that started acting weird after that one. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=538.8399999999999s)]
*  She felt as though, you know, after her third child got the vaccine, it turned him angry. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=543.76s)]
*  There are so many vaccines that you have to get now. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=549.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=552.72s)]
*  And in the previous years, there wasn't that much. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=553.72s)]
*  So we think it's not good anymore. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=556.24s)]
*  And after that, you know, combined with things that she had heard from the community about [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=558.9599999999999s)]
*  the risks of the vaccine, she decided that she wasn't going to vaccinate any more of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=562.8s)]
*  her children. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  And as a result, several of her children fell ill with measles during this outbreak. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  And she was just exhausted. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=572.88s)]
*  The little one is crying all day. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=574.64s)]
*  How old is the little one? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  Two. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=578.4399999999999s)]
*  That's three. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=580.4399999999999s)]
*  That must be awful. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's really bad. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  But I asked her whether this changed anything for her, whether she regretted not getting [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  her younger kids vaccinated. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=589.32s)]
*  Like, did you think about maybe I should get the vaccine for measles? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=590.8s)]
*  No. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=595.48s)]
*  No. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=596.48s)]
*  And she basically said no. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=597.48s)]
*  So I really wanted to go deeper, to understand more fully how people are making these decisions. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=599.3199999999999s)]
*  What's wrong? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=606.6s)]
*  So I connected with this mom of four in Seminole. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=607.6s)]
*  Yeah, you have a spackle on your toe. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=610.16s)]
*  A woman named Ansley Claassen. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=614.12s)]
*  Can you put your shoes on, please? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=615.64s)]
*  I met her at a park just a few blocks away from the hospital. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=619.92s)]
*  You know, this is a mom who is really scared of her kids getting measles. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=624.92s)]
*  You know, she's pregnant herself. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=629.88s)]
*  She understands the risks to pregnant women, to young kids. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=631.68s)]
*  There's an outbreak. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=635.5999999999999s)]
*  I know that there are people that are not going to, you know, quarantine like they need [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=636.5999999999999s)]
*  to. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=641.16s)]
*  And that's really scary because I don't want to catch it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=642.4799999999999s)]
*  And I don't want my children in the hospital for it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=644.8s)]
*  And are her kids vaccinated? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=647.4799999999999s)]
*  She has vaccinated one of her kids up to one year. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=649.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=653.4s)]
*  Around that time is when the COVID-19 pandemic started. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=654.56s)]
*  And that is when a lot of misinformation around vaccines, around the medical system started [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=658.92s)]
*  swirling around on social media. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  And she decided not to get any of her other kids vaccinated. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=667.76s)]
*  There is just so much fear and so much just people like you need to vaccinate, like just [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=671.76s)]
*  kind of being a little pushy on the topic. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=678.12s)]
*  I didn't like that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=681.12s)]
*  When this outbreak first started, she considered getting the MMR vaccine for her kids. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=682.12s)]
*  Like I said, she knows that it's a serious disease. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=688.32s)]
*  And there's just, like I said, so much uncertainty. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=691.68s)]
*  And there are stories that you can read that people like multiple hours after they got [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=694.72s)]
*  the vaccine, they have had effects. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=698.12s)]
*  But she had seen these scary stories on her mom groups, on social media, on TikTok of [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=700.72s)]
*  kids suddenly dying after getting shots, which is not something that happens or is [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=706.76s)]
*  common at all. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=712.6s)]
*  Ultimately, she and her husband preyed on it and decided not to get her kids vaccinated. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=714.32s)]
*  So Teddy, it sounds like during COVID, when there was so much division over vaccines, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  and that moment when everybody seemed to be in a panic over who they could trust, it was [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=726.36s)]
*  in that moment that Ansley herself lost trust with the broader public health system, which, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=731.96s)]
*  of course, we know is meant to protect everyone in a community. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=737.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=741.48s)]
*  And there are lots of vulnerable people in the community that are impacted by a virus [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=742.56s)]
*  as contagious as measles. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=748.04s)]
*  There are babies who are too young to get the vaccine. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=750.16s)]
*  There are pregnant people who aren't eligible to get the shot and people who are immunocompromised, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=753.88s)]
*  who can't build up that immunity themselves. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=760.52s)]
*  I saw a patient of Dr. Parky's, a teacher, who had gotten the MMR vaccine, but she was [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=763.4s)]
*  immunocompromised. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  So she ended up getting just this really nasty case of measles. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=771.3199999999999s)]
*  The rash was covering her torso. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  It had spread under her hair. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=778.16s)]
*  Her scalp was really sore. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=780.36s)]
*  She was bedridden for a week. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=783.36s)]
*  And this is sort of the point of public health. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=786.36s)]
*  It's to protect everyone. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=788.6800000000001s)]
*  And when you're talking about a disease as contagious as measles, this is what can happen. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=791.08s)]
*  It can spread beyond the people who just choose for themselves not to get vaccinated. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=797.2s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=810.8s)]
*  How do we eliminate measles in this country in the first place? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=816.24s)]
*  And I'm asking because these cases are increasing and I want to understand how and I guess if [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=828.04s)]
*  we can stop them at this point. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=834.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=836.04s)]
*  So I think what a lot of people don't appreciate when it comes to the elimination of measles [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=837.04s)]
*  is just how widespread it was before the vaccine. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=842.96s)]
*  So before it became available in the early 1960s, almost all children got measles by [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  the time they were 15. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=853.36s)]
*  And about 500 people died every year. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  So this is everywhere. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=858.72s)]
*  Eliminating measles was a really hard fought victory that took about four decades. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=861.0s)]
*  The end product of medicine's long match with measles, the live attenuated virus measles vaccine. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=869.8s)]
*  And when you think of the COVID vaccine, that's something that was developed really quickly. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=877.8s)]
*  But that's not what normally happens. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=882.5999999999999s)]
*  They had isolated the measles virus in 1954. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=889.0799999999999s)]
*  They had started doing trials to check the efficacy, the side effects, and they didn't [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=892.68s)]
*  have a usable vaccine until 1963. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=897.6s)]
*  And then they had to get people to take the vaccine. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=902.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=905.24s)]
*  Many parents think of measles as just a common nuisance, but physicians today know that measles [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=906.24s)]
*  is more than a nuisance. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=911.48s)]
*  They had to launch these massive campaigns to get the vaccination rate as high as possible. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=913.4s)]
*  Supplies of the vaccine are ready for shipment to doctors throughout the country. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=919.8000000000001s)]
*  They poured funding into making vaccines available and accessible. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=923.32s)]
*  They made the vaccines a requirement for public schools. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=927.4s)]
*  The goal was to get as many people as possible vaccinated to starve this virus of oxygen. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=930.92s)]
*  As the increasing numbers of children are vaccinated, we will be well on the way to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=938.3199999999999s)]
*  eradicating a disease that down through the centuries has killed millions of children [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=943.0s)]
*  and left others impaired mentally and physically. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=948.36s)]
*  And this is that phrase herd immunity, right? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=952.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=958.5200000000001s)]
*  Can you explain it to me a little bit better? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=959.5200000000001s)]
*  So for a virus as contagious as measles. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=961.24s)]
*  And it's really contagious, right? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=964.6s)]
*  The most contagious. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=966.1600000000001s)]
*  One person infected with measles can spread it to 18 other people. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=967.6600000000001s)]
*  Oof. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=971.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=972.84s)]
*  So the idea is you get as many people as possible protected against measles so that if one person [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=973.84s)]
*  in the community becomes infected, it has nowhere to go. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=979.32s)]
*  You've starved it of oxygen essentially until it simmers down. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=983.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's what the United States was able to do, right? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=987.82s)]
*  It got the vaccination rate high enough, took away the oxygen and the disease couldn't spread. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=991.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  So the result of this big public campaign to get people vaccinated, the requirements, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=998.9200000000001s)]
*  funding investment was essentially that by 2000, vaccination rates were above 95%. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1004.0s)]
*  And as a country, the U.S. had eliminated this disease. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1011.9599999999999s)]
*  It went from something that pretty much everyone gets as a child to something unheard of. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1015.76s)]
*  That is until vaccination rates started coming down. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  So if you look at the graphs of rates of vaccination nationally, it's gone from 95% [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1032.78s)]
*  to 93%, which doesn't sound like a big deal. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1038.7s)]
*  But you have to think that this isn't evenly distributed. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1041.42s)]
*  You have some pockets like in Gaines County where you're closer to 80%, which is a real [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1045.24s)]
*  danger zone. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1050.16s)]
*  And the more of these pockets that you get, the more likely that these outbreaks are going [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1051.82s)]
*  to hop from group to group. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1056.44s)]
*  And those falling rates go hand in hand with the mistrust in the system that we talked [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1058.78s)]
*  about. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1063.18s)]
*  It was always there to some extent, but really ramped up during COVID. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1064.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1067.7s)]
*  And of course, there's this other thing that's changed. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1068.7s)]
*  Trump won and he appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1070.98s)]
*  Kennedy's been a huge promoter of vaccine skepticism and now by virtue of his position [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1076.58s)]
*  as the secretary is in charge of the CDC, which is the leading agency responding to [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1082.86s)]
*  this outbreak. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1089.2199999999998s)]
*  So how is R.F.K. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1090.74s)]
*  Jr.'s CDC doing so far? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1092.2199999999998s)]
*  So for the most part, during outbreaks like this, state and local officials are managing [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1094.6999999999998s)]
*  the on-the-ground response. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1100.5s)]
*  And what the CDC typically does is they are out front encouraging everyone to get vaccinated. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1102.62s)]
*  Several experts I spoke to thought that the reaction from federal health officials this [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1108.7s)]
*  time around has been really muted. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1113.18s)]
*  The CDC only posted their first significant notice about the outbreak almost a month after [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1115.98s)]
*  the first cases in Texas started popping up. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1121.66s)]
*  One epidemiologist I spoke to said they've been, quote, shouting with a whisper. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1124.92s)]
*  And then there was this cabinet meeting at the White House in February where R.F.K. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1138.82s)]
*  Jr. was asked about the outbreak by reporters. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1142.94s)]
*  Bobby, do you want to speak on that? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1145.62s)]
*  We are following the measles epidemic every day. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1147.7s)]
*  I think there's 120... [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1150.9s)]
*  And he seemed to minimize it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1152.78s)]
*  There have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1155.54s)]
*  Last year there were 16. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1159.82s)]
*  He said it wasn't unusual. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1161.66s)]
*  And there are about 20 people hospitalized mainly for quarantine. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1164.46s)]
*  He falsely claimed that many of the people hospitalized from this outbreak were there [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1169.22s)]
*  for quarantine, which is not true. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1173.94s)]
*  They were there because they were sick. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1175.9s)]
*  And you know, after he faced pushback from these comments, he changed his tune a little [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1178.6200000000001s)]
*  bit. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1183.46s)]
*  I've spoken to the parents of the child who died. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1184.46s)]
*  It was a very, very emotional and long conversation with them. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1187.22s)]
*  So he went on Fox News and he did this long interview. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1192.06s)]
*  He said he spoke to the Mennonite community. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1196.3s)]
*  He talked to the family of the child who died. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1199.3799999999999s)]
*  At this point we are recommending that people in those communities get vaccines. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1202.8999999999999s)]
*  And he actually comes out and says that, you know, health officials recommend the vaccine [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1207.62s)]
*  for people in Gaines County. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1212.34s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1213.8999999999999s)]
*  But almost moments later... [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1214.8999999999999s)]
*  He starts talking about some of the risks of getting vaccinated. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1215.9s)]
*  He says that there are people in the Mennonite community who are quote unquote vaccine injured. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1228.26s)]
*  You know, again, the risks of getting the MMR vaccine are very low. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1234.14s)]
*  He even goes so far as to say at one point... [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1238.3200000000002s)]
*  Based upon what's best for that patient rather than, you know, what's best theoretically [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1245.9s)]
*  for the entire community. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1251.18s)]
*  That's the only way that... [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1252.6200000000001s)]
*  That, you know, medicine should be focused on individual health versus, you know, what [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1253.6200000000001s)]
*  he says is theoretically good for the community. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1258.8200000000002s)]
*  And as I said, we are recommending that people in Gaines County get vaccines where we are [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1262.9s)]
*  also respectful of their personal choices. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1268.3000000000002s)]
*  And so ultimately he's making a pretty weak recommendation for vaccines and emphasizing [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1270.96s)]
*  this idea of personal choice. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1276.4s)]
*  So how do career public health officials view this? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1279.64s)]
*  What are they thinking about the outbreaks? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1282.64s)]
*  So I think a lot of experts are really looking at what's happening in Gaines County as a [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1284.8600000000001s)]
*  warning sign. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1289.8400000000001s)]
*  If vaccines rates dip any lower, we are at serious risk of these outbreaks sort of igniting [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1291.54s)]
*  on a national scale. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1297.64s)]
*  You know, it might not happen with this outbreak, but it might happen next year. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1299.64s)]
*  And they're not just worried about this one virus. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1303.5400000000002s)]
*  You know, you can think about measles sort of like a canary in the coal mine. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1306.0600000000002s)]
*  When you see an outbreak of measles, it's likely that other vaccine preventable infections [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1310.24s)]
*  are not so far behind. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1315.3600000000001s)]
*  Teddy, I wonder if we're going to look back on this outbreak and see it as something of [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1317.0s)]
*  a turning point. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1322.16s)]
*  I mean, the idea for a long time in this country was that public health meant something needs [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1323.4s)]
*  to be done for the greater good, even if it's distasteful or uncomfortable for the individual. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1328.56s)]
*  But we're living through a moment where actually individual rights are in the forefront, right? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1334.92s)]
*  We have an administration that's embraced that very idea. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1339.4s)]
*  And it's to the point where even the Secretary of Health won't directly encourage people [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1342.8600000000001s)]
*  to get vaccinated. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1347.1s)]
*  You know, I think we might be at a turning point. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1348.98s)]
*  Even on the ground at the heart of this outbreak, I talked to a public health official in Seminole [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1352.08s)]
*  who said he recognizes that measles is an awful virus and he wants people to get the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1359.8s)]
*  vaccine because he knows it can prevent so many of these cases and hospitalizations. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1365.84s)]
*  But he also said, you know, this is Texas and people have the right to do what they [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1370.8799999999999s)]
*  want with their bodies. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1377.2s)]
*  And so if people continue to make that choice and stay unvaccinated, we know what happens. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1379.78s)]
*  This is an incredibly contagious virus. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1387.04s)]
*  And we know what viruses do when they have enough oxygen. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1390.1399999999999s)]
*  Teddy, thank you. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1400.78s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1402.66s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1409.78s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1424.78s)]
*  Today, we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1426.78s)]
*  On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced Ukraine had agreed to a U.S. proposal for [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1431.78s)]
*  a ceasefire with Russia following talks between the two countries in Saudi Arabia. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1437.78s)]
*  American officials also said the U.S. would immediately resume military assistance to [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1443.78s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1447.78s)]
*  It was a major breakthrough after a disastrous meeting in the Oval Office in February between [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1448.78s)]
*  President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1454.78s)]
*  We'll take this offer now to the Russians and we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1457.78s)]
*  say yes to peace. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1461.78s)]
*  The ball is now in their court. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1462.78s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the proposed ceasefire agreement now puts [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1464.78s)]
*  the pressure on Russia to end the war. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1469.78s)]
*  Russian officials did not comment on the U.S. proposal, which was announced just hours after [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1472.78s)]
*  Ukrainian drones had targeted Moscow. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1478.78s)]
*  Also on Tuesday, the Trump administration continued its dismantling of the Department [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1484.78s)]
*  of Education, announcing that more than 1,300 employees will be laid off. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1489.78s)]
*  The department will now be about half the size as it was when Trump started his second [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1494.78s)]
*  term. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1499.78s)]
*  The president has long promised to eliminate the department, but it's a move he can't [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1500.78s)]
*  make without the approval of Congress. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1504.78s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Will Reid and Alex Stern with help from Mujzadeh. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQouJGkmIE&t=1510.78s)]
