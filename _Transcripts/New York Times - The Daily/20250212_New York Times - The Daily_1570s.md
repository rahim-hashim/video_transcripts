# Are Trump’s Executive Orders Creating a Constitutional Crisis?
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=4.3s)]
*  As President Trump issues executive orders that encroach on the powers of Congress, and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  in some cases fly in the face of established law, a debate has begun about whether he's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=16.84s)]
*  merely testing the boundaries of his power or triggering a full-blown constitutional [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=23.04s)]
*  crisis. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=30.16s)]
*  Today, my colleague Adam Liptaak wades through that debate. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=31.72s)]
*  It's Wednesday, February 12th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=43.84s)]
*  Tonight there are warnings that the U.S. is dangerously close to a constitutional crisis. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=53.16s)]
*  We are hearing the phrase constitutional crisis already less than a month into this presidency. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=58.2s)]
*  We've got our toes right on the edge. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=63.12s)]
*  We are basically on the cusp. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=66.22s)]
*  We're really heading toward a constitutional crisis. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  Our founding fathers created three co-equal branches of government to ensure that no one [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=80.4s)]
*  man can be king. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  But here we are. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=86.84s)]
*  Listen, I think this is the most serious constitutional crisis the country has faced, certainly since [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=87.84s)]
*  Watergate the president is. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  I can't tell you how many times I heard constitutional crisis during the first term of Donald Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=94.04s)]
*  And here they go again. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=99.56s)]
*  Adam, welcome back. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=111.4s)]
*  Always a distinct pleasure. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  It's good to be here, Michael. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  The phrase du jour, Adam, right now in Washington is constitutional crisis. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=117.04s)]
*  And we come to you as our resident scholar of the law and the courts to understand what [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=123.4s)]
*  a constitutional crisis actually is and how you know when you are in the middle of one. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=129.24s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds serious, doesn't it? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=136.16s)]
*  It does. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  I've been talking to a lot of law professors and what emerges from those conversations [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=140.38s)]
*  is that there's no fixed agreed upon definition of a constitutional crisis. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  It has characteristics, notably when one of the three branches tries to get out of its [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=152.66s)]
*  lane, assert too much power. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=160.66s)]
*  It often involves a president flouting statutes, flouting the constitution, flouting judicial [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=164.54s)]
*  orders, and it can be a single instance, but it's more typically cumulative. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  But it's not a binary thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=178.82s)]
*  It's not a switch. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  It's a slope that can descend and it takes on a quality of danger if there's a lot of it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=182.5s)]
*  So given that loose definition that seems to acknowledge the fluidity of a constitutional [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=192.46s)]
*  crisis, how should we think about whether President Trump's actions over the past few [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  weeks represent a constitutional crisis or perhaps something else, something less serious? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=203.62s)]
*  So the consensus is that this is a constitutional crisis and let me try to unpack why so many [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=211.02s)]
*  people think that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  The president will often use his power to its fullest extent to assert a constitutional [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=223.46s)]
*  authority to do things that other branches may oppose. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  But what we have with President Trump is a kind of wholesale reconception of the part [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=237.22s)]
*  of the constitution, Article 2, that sets out presidential power that asserts that he's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  basically the decision maker, that he can act alone, he can disregard instructions from [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=251.7s)]
*  Congress and Congress is in Article 1. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  Congress makes the law. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=263.9s)]
*  That sounds significant. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=265.58s)]
*  The president is charged by the constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=266.58s)]
*  executed. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  That would seem ordinarily to put him in a subordinate role, but the music of Trump's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=271.68s)]
*  actions over the past several weeks has been quite different, has been to insist on his primacy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=277.7s)]
*  Well, I want to walk us through some of the specific examples of how President Trump is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=289.66s)]
*  muddling with our traditional notions of Article 1, Article 2, basically the separation of [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=293.82s)]
*  powers between the legislative and executive branch and how he is trying to expand the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=302.22s)]
*  powers of the executive. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=306.92s)]
*  So a couple of quick examples. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  Congress has instructed the president not to fire people unless he satisfies certain [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  criteria. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=318.36s)]
*  Sometimes he has to have a good reason. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=319.36s)]
*  Sometimes he has to wait 30 days. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=322.0s)]
*  Sometimes he has to explain himself to Congress. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  President Trump has busted through all those limitations and insisted that as head of the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=327.16s)]
*  executive branch, he can fire whomever he will. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  Congress has also passed laws instructing the president to spend money to do certain [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=334.56s)]
*  things. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=338.2s)]
*  President Trump takes the view that if those instructions are inconsistent with his policy [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=339.84s)]
*  agenda, he doesn't have to do it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=345.96s)]
*  Congress can't make him spend the money Congress has appropriated. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=348.32s)]
*  Congress, of course, has the power of the purse. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=352.48s)]
*  So you would think there's a pretty good argument that the president has to do what Congress [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=355.36s)]
*  says. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=359.52s)]
*  So for example, what you just said would apply to the congressionally appropriated money [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=360.52s)]
*  for USAID, the foreign aid agency that the president has decided to shut down. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=363.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=370.84s)]
*  Congress told the president what to do. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  The president is doing the opposite. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=374.84s)]
*  That seems to contain some real seeds of what most people would think of as a constitutional [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=376.8s)]
*  crisis. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=382.59999999999997s)]
*  And this is notable too, Michael. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=383.84s)]
*  He's doing this in the face of a Congress that's not opposing him. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=387.08s)]
*  To the contrary, if President Trump were to seek legislation from this Congress limiting [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=391.14s)]
*  or shutting down USAID, I think he'd be very likely to succeed. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=396.94s)]
*  But he seems not to be interested in working with the other branch, a branch that he essentially [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=401.46s)]
*  controls, but to insist that he has the sole power to do things. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  So what might deepen this sense that we are in a constitutional crisis is not just that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  the president is ignoring Congress's will, its actions, its appropriations, but he's [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=416.22s)]
*  not even engaging them on these questions in a way that he very much could. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=421.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's a raw assertion of power and it's a little surprising. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=425.82000000000005s)]
*  I mean, if you have a Republican controlled Congress that's ready to do your bidding and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  you could button this down and make lasting change that's unassailable, it's a little [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=435.06s)]
*  bit surprising that in the early weeks of a four-year term, he wants to do everything [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=441.58s)]
*  at once. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=446.62s)]
*  And that has the quality of a crisis too, this notion that we're flooding the zone with endless [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=447.97999999999996s)]
*  executive orders and scores of lawsuits. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=453.06s)]
*  It just gives rise to the sense that we're encountering a wholly new and maybe dangerous [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=456.65999999999997s)]
*  atmosphere. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=462.46s)]
*  Well, where else do his actions seem to potentially be creating a constitutional crisis? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=463.46s)]
*  So where to begin? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=468.9s)]
*  He has shut down all kinds of federal spending that Congress has instructed him to spend. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=470.42s)]
*  He's deputized Elon Musk and his Doge Warriors to inspect all kinds of government logs and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=477.38s)]
*  computer activity that gives rise to at least some privacy concerns. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=486.74s)]
*  And maybe notably, he has by executive order purported to do away with what is generally [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=492.22s)]
*  thought to be a fundamental constitutional right of birthright citizenship that is with [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=499.68s)]
*  very rare exceptions. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=505.2s)]
*  If you're born in the United States, you're a United States citizen. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=507.0s)]
*  And that list of actions that you just went through, it feels like they aren't all the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=511.24s)]
*  same. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=516.92s)]
*  So which ones in your mind and in the mind of the legal scholars that you're speaking [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=518.0s)]
*  to are just the president seeking to expand his authority, which we've always understood [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=522.0s)]
*  President Trump to want to do even during the campaign? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=527.6s)]
*  And which ones seem like just frontal assaults on the Constitution and potentially the stuff [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=531.64s)]
*  of a constitutional crisis? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  So I think I'd put it in three buckets, Michael. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=538.64s)]
*  One is Trump's role as the head of the executive branch. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=542.0s)]
*  And there he has pretty good arguments that he's the boss, that he can decide who works [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=547.52s)]
*  for him and that he can fire people, including heads of independent agencies that Congress [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=554.74s)]
*  has tried to insulate from political pressure, inspectors general who have an important role [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=561.9000000000001s)]
*  in keeping fraud and corruption out of agencies. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=568.58s)]
*  That may not sound like the best idea as a policy matter, but the Supreme Court has been [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=573.5s)]
*  increasingly sympathetic to the idea that at least where it's all inside the executive [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=578.38s)]
*  branch, the president has a lot of power. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=584.74s)]
*  So that first bucket, he may well succeed in many of his arguments. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=588.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=592.78s)]
*  He has a legal leg to stand on. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=593.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=594.78s)]
*  The second bucket gets much harder where Congress has specifically instructed him to do something, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=595.78s)]
*  to spend money, to maintain agencies, USAID, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=602.98s)]
*  the Department of Education, the notion that the president is allowed to disregard congressional [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=611.3s)]
*  instructions on things like that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=617.42s)]
*  That's a tough argument. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=619.8199999999999s)]
*  And then the third bucket gets even harder where the Constitution, most people think, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=621.54s)]
*  has insisted that there's a constitutional right to birthright citizenship. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=629.54s)]
*  And under the conventional understanding, you can't do away with that by executive order. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=636.6999999999999s)]
*  You can't do away with that by statute. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=641.98s)]
*  Congress can't do away with it. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=643.9s)]
*  It's in the Constitution. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=645.3s)]
*  If something's going to change, it needs to be done by constitutional amendment. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=646.3s)]
*  So the president's order in the early days of his administration that says, I declare [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  that this constitutional right doesn't exist is quite brazen and bold. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=657.54s)]
*  So now that we know that Congress does not seem inclined to act against this president, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=662.54s)]
*  the Republican-controlled House and Senate, and given that the president doesn't seem [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=670.06s)]
*  all that interested in engaging this Congress, it very much does seem like we're at a point [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=673.42s)]
*  where, if we are, as these scholars have told you, in a constitutional crisis of one form [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=677.98s)]
*  or another, that it will be the courts, the federal courts, that will play a major role [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=683.82s)]
*  in keeping the president in check. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=693.4200000000001s)]
*  And the courts are already dealing with an extraordinary number of suits. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=694.4200000000001s)]
*  They seem to multiply by the day. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=699.1400000000001s)]
*  And while none of them have reached the Supreme Court yet, in the coming, I would say, weeks, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=703.62s)]
*  we are going to have major clashes before a Supreme Court that is dominated by six conservative [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=709.62s)]
*  appointees and will be sympathetic to some of what Trump wants to achieve, but is not [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=717.3s)]
*  going to be on board for the whole project. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=724.3s)]
*  And then the open question is, assuming the court rules against President Trump, will [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=728.54s)]
*  he obey that judgment? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=734.7s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=737.7s)]
*  Adam, so far, it is not the Supreme Court, as you said, but the lower federal courts [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=754.3000000000001s)]
*  that have weighed in on President Trump's actions. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=758.82s)]
*  And my sense is that so far, they have taken a very dim view of his efforts to expand his [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=761.6600000000001s)]
*  executive power and encroach on the powers of Congress. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=766.66s)]
*  He has been on an epic losing streak. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=770.66s)]
*  Some of that can be explained by plaintiffs suing in friendly courts, but appointees of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=774.34s)]
*  all different kinds of presidents, including President Trump himself, have ruled against [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=780.46s)]
*  him and have said that Elon Musk can't have access to some materials, that people can't [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=785.7s)]
*  be fired, that agencies can't be disassembled, that the birthright citizenship order is unconstitutional. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=793.7s)]
*  And some of these judges have been very harsh. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=802.6600000000001s)]
*  One of them in blocking the birthright citizenship order said that he had difficulty understanding [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=806.38s)]
*  how a member of the bar could state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=813.1600000000001s)]
*  It boggles my mind. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=818.44s)]
*  That gives you a flavor of how Trump is doing in the lower courts. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=821.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=825.5s)]
*  And, of course, this has prompted some around the president to say, well, hold on a minute. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=826.5s)]
*  The courts are overstepping their bounds in reigning in our efforts to expand our bounds. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=833.5799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=842.3s)]
*  And JD Vance, the vice president, has taken the most assertive attitude toward this, saying [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=843.3s)]
*  that the president doesn't have to obey rulings from courts that are at odds with his understanding [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=848.74s)]
*  of the Constitution. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=855.1800000000001s)]
*  I just want to read what JD Vance wrote about this, because he tried to put it into a larger [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=856.1800000000001s)]
*  legal context. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=861.46s)]
*  And he seemed to write this right after the president had lost a series of rulings of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=862.86s)]
*  the kind you just went through. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=866.94s)]
*  And he wrote, if a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=868.74s)]
*  would be illegal. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=874.86s)]
*  And he goes on to say, if a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=875.98s)]
*  her discretion as a prosecutor, that would be illegal. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=881.26s)]
*  And then he goes on to apply this logic to the president. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=885.22s)]
*  He says, judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power either. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=888.74s)]
*  So what do we make of that argument? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=895.3000000000001s)]
*  So it sounds quite radical, doesn't it? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=897.58s)]
*  I mean, we generally agree, as Americans, that the court has the last word over the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=899.9399999999999s)]
*  constitutionality of congressional action, executive action. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=906.5799999999999s)]
*  And if JD Vance is suggesting as a general matter that the president disagrees with that, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=912.38s)]
*  well, that's a constitutional crisis. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=919.26s)]
*  I guess I would make, though, an observation, Michael, that there are probably some areas [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  where if the constitution distinctly and exclusively commits some right to the president, like, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=928.6999999999999s)]
*  say, the pardon power, and a court were to say, no, you can't pardon your buddy, the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=935.3399999999999s)]
*  president's interpretation of the constitution could well govern there. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=942.3399999999999s)]
*  And there's a flavor of this in the Supreme Court's decision in July granting Trump broad [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=946.8199999999999s)]
*  immunity from prosecution, where the court talks about those powers that are core executive [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=953.4200000000001s)]
*  powers are for the president only. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=960.5400000000001s)]
*  The Vance statement seems to resonate with that way of thinking, too. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=963.7s)]
*  In other words, it may be a narrower interpretation of when the president can ignore the courts [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=967.3000000000001s)]
*  than perhaps it seems. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=974.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=976.46s)]
*  But I don't want to minimize it. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=977.46s)]
*  I mean, it's a hell of a thing to even contemplate the Supreme Court saying to Richard Nixon, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=978.58s)]
*  you got to turn over the White House tapes. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=985.58s)]
*  And Richard Nixon, and he thought about this, saying no, that would be a classic constitutional [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=988.1800000000001s)]
*  crisis. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=994.58s)]
*  Well, what Vance is writing here seems to presuppose that there's going to come a moment [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=995.58s)]
*  pretty soon when these lower court rulings get appealed all the way up to the Supreme [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1001.22s)]
*  Court and the Supreme Court issues a ruling against President Trump that attempts to [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1006.14s)]
*  reign in his power. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1012.22s)]
*  And I guess I'm curious, based on your legal analysis and your reporting over the past [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1013.98s)]
*  couple of weeks, where we think the Supreme Court may choose to weigh in and attempt to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1017.58s)]
*  curtail the president's power. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1022.5s)]
*  We don't know, of course, exactly what case will reach the court and exactly how the court [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1025.42s)]
*  will think about it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1029.82s)]
*  I think the court will be very scared of, alert to the possibility of a constitutional [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1031.26s)]
*  crisis, of a pure impasse. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1038.56s)]
*  So my guess, Michael, is that the court is going to try to find a case where in a splashy [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1041.5800000000002s)]
*  way it rebukes Trump, rules against him, but ideally in a case where the president can't [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1047.56s)]
*  really disobey the court's judgment. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1054.92s)]
*  And birthright citizenship is the classic example of this. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1057.92s)]
*  And why would the court think that Trump could not, even if he wanted to, disobey that ruling? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1061.3200000000002s)]
*  It's just a logistical nightmare. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1066.28s)]
*  It requires Trump to essentially instruct every hospital administrator in the nation [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1068.72s)]
*  about how to track the citizenship of every newborn. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1074.2s)]
*  It's hard enough to do if you had the law at your back in the face of a Supreme Court [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1078.1200000000001s)]
*  judgment. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1083.2s)]
*  It becomes really hard to imagine. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1084.2s)]
*  I'm curious, Adam, what would be a case where the Supreme Court might fear that Trump would [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1087.36s)]
*  disobey them? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1092.56s)]
*  A pretty staggering thing to contemplate, but from what you're saying, the court actively [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1093.56s)]
*  does fear that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1097.6399999999999s)]
*  I guess I can think of lots of examples, but why don't we talk about USAID? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1099.56s)]
*  President wants to do away with that. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1104.36s)]
*  The court says, you can't do that on your own. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1106.28s)]
*  You can go to Congress. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1108.52s)]
*  But you are not authorized, Mr. President, to disobey Congress's instructions about the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  existence of and the nature of and the spending of that agency. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1116.84s)]
*  And Trump lets posit, says, I disagree, and shuts the agency down anyway. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1121.8799999999999s)]
*  The court doesn't want to find itself in that situation. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1128.36s)]
*  The court has always, through its entire history, been very sensitive to the idea that it's [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1132.24s)]
*  not really clear why we do what it tells us to do. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1139.28s)]
*  They don't have an army. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  They don't have the power of the purse. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1144.64s)]
*  They have this kind of fuzzy thing we call legitimacy and authority. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1146.8400000000001s)]
*  And they're very wary of that being undermined. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1151.8000000000002s)]
*  And all it takes is for the president one time to say, as Andrew Jackson did say, apocryphally, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1156.2800000000002s)]
*  the chief justice has made his decision. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  Now let him enforce it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1166.2800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1167.2800000000002s)]
*  You're saying the court's authority is a norm and Trump likes to subvert norms. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1168.2800000000002s)]
*  And you think the court would go out of its way to avoid rulings, even when they are correct [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1172.8s)]
*  on the legal merits, that Trump might seek to subvert, which is pretty fascinating. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1177.02s)]
*  I think you would get some motivated reasoning from justices who probably wouldn't put this [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1182.36s)]
*  at the forefront of their minds, but would talk themselves into thinking, well, maybe [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1188.36s)]
*  we rule for the president here. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1194.04s)]
*  Maybe it's not such a bad thing. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1195.8s)]
*  And somewhere in the substrata of their consciousness is the lurking feeling that if we go the other [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1197.9s)]
*  way, things are going to be bad for the institution. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1204.5400000000002s)]
*  So what we would seem to be looking at, based on everything you're saying, is a legislative [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1208.3400000000001s)]
*  branch that's not at all enthusiastic about curtailing the president's authority. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1212.2800000000002s)]
*  We're looking at a judicial branch with the Supreme Court atop it that is disinclined [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1217.5400000000002s)]
*  to try to curtail the president's power out of fear that he may ultimately just ignore [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1224.3s)]
*  them. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1229.22s)]
*  And so it seems very possible that, as these legal scholars have told you, we may be in [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1230.22s)]
*  what they see as a constitutional crisis. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1235.34s)]
*  I guess my question is, what happens if we are in a constitutional crisis and most Americans [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1238.26s)]
*  don't care? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1244.26s)]
*  And I ask that because Trump was elected by tens of millions of people who wanted him [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1245.26s)]
*  to shake up the system. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1251.3799999999999s)]
*  And early polling does very much suggest that many people are pleased at the pace at which [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1253.14s)]
*  he's fulfilling his promises. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1257.7s)]
*  And part of that promise was a stronger executive who's just busting through any barrier in [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1260.74s)]
*  his way. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1267.38s)]
*  And so is it a constitutional crisis if a lot of Americans don't see it as a crisis? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1268.6000000000001s)]
*  It can be thought of, and I take your point, as simply a reimagining of what the Constitution [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1277.34s)]
*  calls for, that maybe people approve of. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1285.3799999999999s)]
*  And maybe what we're on the cusp of here is, you know, without an amendment, without a [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1289.22s)]
*  constitutional convention, just a reorientation of the separation of powers in a way that [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1294.82s)]
*  elevates the president to a role that we've not seen before at the expense of the other [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1302.98s)]
*  branches. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1310.66s)]
*  But all of that said, a crisis is a crisis. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1318.1s)]
*  And if our very understanding of the Constitution is being tested by a president who, legal [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1322.34s)]
*  scholars say, seems to have a contempt for the document, we are in the midst of something [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1330.06s)]
*  profound, whether or not people are taking it seriously today. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1337.14s)]
*  Well, Adam, thank you very much. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1350.22s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1352.98s)]
*  On Tuesday night, President Trump personally denounced the federal judges who have blocked [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1359.98s)]
*  his actions over the past few weeks, especially his attempts to shut down agencies like USAID [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1368.06s)]
*  and freeze their funds. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1375.38s)]
*  And it seems hard to believe that judges want to try and stop us from looking for corruption, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1377.06s)]
*  especially when we found hundreds of millions of dollars worth, much more than that, in [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1381.78s)]
*  just a short period of time. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1387.38s)]
*  And he delivered what appeared to be a thinly veiled threat against the judges who stand [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1389.98s)]
*  in his way. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1396.54s)]
*  Well, so maybe we have to look at the judges because that's a very serious, I think it's [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1398.02s)]
*  a very serious violation. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1402.62s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1416.26s)]
*  Here's what else you need to another day. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1419.02s)]
*  I'll ask Elon Musk to say a few words and we'll take some questions. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1425.7s)]
*  Elon, go ahead. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1431.94s)]
*  Sure. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1432.94s)]
*  During an extraordinary 30 minute appearance in the Oval Office on Tuesday night, Elon [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1433.94s)]
*  Musk, joined by his four year old son, defended his plans to drastically shrink the size of [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1440.1399999999999s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1446.5s)]
*  We have this unelected fourth unconstitutional branch of government, which is the bureaucracy, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1447.58s)]
*  which has in a lot of ways currently more power than any elected representative. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1454.06s)]
*  And this is not something that people want. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1459.54s)]
*  But Musk made multiple unsubstantiated claims about government fraud, including the claim [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1462.98s)]
*  that officials at USAID have taken kickbacks. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1469.62s)]
*  And he acknowledged that some of his most inflammatory public claims, for instance, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1473.82s)]
*  that aid workers planned to send $50 million worth of condoms to Hamas, were wrong. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1478.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1485.06s)]
*  So nobody's going to bet a thousand. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1490.46s)]
*  I mean, we will make mistakes, but we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1492.46s)]
*  And during a visit to the White House, King Abdullah of Jordan rejected President Trump's [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1498.02s)]
*  proposal that his country take in Palestinians living in Gaza. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1506.06s)]
*  Nevertheless, Trump reiterated his plan for the United States to take over Gaza through [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1511.58s)]
*  unspecified means and for Jordan and Egypt to accept Palestinians who would be permanently [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1517.34s)]
*  displaced as the U.S. redevelops the territory. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VsithlFKU&t=1523.6999999999998s)]
