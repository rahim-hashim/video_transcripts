# How Pope Francis Changed the Catholic Church
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=12.84s)]
*  On Monday, church bells rang out across the world. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=18.14s)]
*  From Mexico City, to Paris, to Kurdistan, to mark the death of Pope Francis at the age [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=23.92s)]
*  of 88. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  Today, I speak with my colleague, Rome bureau chief Jason Horowitz, about the Pope's push [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  to change the church, his bitter clashes with traditionalists, and what his papacy ultimately [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=51.36s)]
*  means to the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=58.84s)]
*  Tuesday, April 22nd. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=73.24s)]
*  Jason, good evening. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=82.24s)]
*  We know it's late there and that it's been a long day for you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=95.44s)]
*  Happy to be here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=96.44s)]
*  I know from the messages we've been exchanging today in preparation for this conversation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=97.8s)]
*  that you spent some time in St. Peter's Square where mourners are now gathered. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=102.44s)]
*  Can you just describe that scene to us? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=110.88s)]
*  Well, earlier in the day, a strange sort of scene because it was mostly tourists and you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=111.88s)]
*  had a feeling that a lot of people didn't even know what had happened. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=115.88s)]
*  But as the day went on and pilgrims and people who were there to mourn, Francis started arriving [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=119.72s)]
*  and you could really sense a sort of somber feeling take over. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=126.92s)]
*  And by the end of the evening, there were tens of thousands of people there paying tribute [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=131.52s)]
*  to a pope who had led the church for a dozen years, but more important than that, who had [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=136.8s)]
*  pointed the church in a new direction that a lot of them really hoped the church would [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=144.12s)]
*  continue following. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=149.12s)]
*  And some were there also, maybe hoping it took a turn. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=150.66s)]
*  In a different direction. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=155.84s)]
*  In a new direction or an old direction, depending on how you look at it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=156.84s)]
*  Well, that's, I think, what we really want to talk to you about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  The legacy and meaning of this papacy, which turned out to be in some ways more divisive [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=164.56s)]
*  than I think those of us watching from the very beginning might have imagined that it [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=173.32s)]
*  might be. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=178.08s)]
*  And I think actually you came to Rome pretty much around the same time that Francis became [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=179.52s)]
*  Pope. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=185.44s)]
*  So I want you to just talk a little bit about the ultimate legacy of Francis. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=186.6s)]
*  When I think of Francis, I think of sort of a dividing line in the Roman Catholic Church [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=193.8s)]
*  that there are those who see him as finally a breath of fresh air, who came in willing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=199.32s)]
*  to introduce or at least entertain reforms that would thrust the church into modernity. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  So on the liberal sort of side of the church, they saw in Francis the guy who was finally [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=213.92s)]
*  going to go to bat for them and who was going to make these changes and who was going to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=220.07999999999998s)]
*  make the church much more relevant. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  On the other side of the coin, you had conservatives who had been in power for decades with John [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  Paul II and Benedict XVI. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  And they first saw Francis as actually on their side, but then came to fear him and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=233.56s)]
*  what he might do to the doctrine of the church, to what they consider the truth of the church, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=241.64s)]
*  that he would basically shake it so much that he would break it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=247.44s)]
*  And as a result, there was a robust opposition to him within the Vatican and beyond. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think in the end, it's not clear what side he's on because I don't think he thought [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=257.68s)]
*  of himself that way. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=262.76s)]
*  I think he thought of himself as doing something very different, being a pope for not the partisan [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=264.44s)]
*  sides of the church, but for the flock. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=271.2s)]
*  Well, I think to understand how Francis became a dividing line, even if he himself never [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  saw himself that way, we need to talk about his background and how that background made [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  so many people on the left and right see him as a change agent. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=284.44s)]
*  So tell us the story of how he came to be that dividing line. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=290.84s)]
*  So Francis is born as Jorge Bergoglio, he's from Buenos Aires in Argentina. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  He's from a very humble neighborhood. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  He's not poor, but he's more sort of middle class, but just a normal family of Italian [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  descent. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=311.44s)]
*  His grandmother, who he was deeply close to and who was deeply religious, was an Italian [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=312.44s)]
*  immigrant. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=316.88s)]
*  And that also that experience of growing up in an also an immigrant neighborhood, I think, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=317.92s)]
*  opened his eyes to people's trying to make it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=322.52s)]
*  And there were also influences throughout his life and his upbringing that I think had [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=325.92s)]
*  a lasting effect. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=331.36s)]
*  He wanted to be a chemist at a certain point, and he had teachers who had communist politics. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=332.8s)]
*  And it didn't mean that he was a communist, right, which is what some of his critics said, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=337.44s)]
*  but he sees the world from a bottom up point of view. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=341.6s)]
*  And that just imbues him with an empathy that in a way is his sort of guiding light, right, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=345.28s)]
*  through everything. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=352.35999999999996s)]
*  So what draws him to the church, which is, of course, about helping people, but is very [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=354.0s)]
*  hierarchical, and perhaps not so in keeping with this bottom up approach that he's becoming [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=361.76s)]
*  fixated on? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=369.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=370.64s)]
*  The Roman Catholic faith was always really present in Bergoglio's life. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=372.2s)]
*  So he had a sense of the church as an important institution in one's life. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  And at a certain point, he's a teenager, he has a bunch of friends, he's going to go hang [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=379.88s)]
*  out with them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=384.76s)]
*  But he passes the Basilica of St. Joseph, and he has an epiphany. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=386.24s)]
*  He feels a calling, and he decides that no, he's not going to be a chemist. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  He is going to dedicate his life to the church. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  He wants to be a priest. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=399.52s)]
*  That changes his life, and it changes the life of the church eventually. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=401.68s)]
*  So Francis becomes a priest, and he's a Jesuit priest, which is a Catholic order, probably [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=405.64s)]
*  best known for being intellectuals. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  They care a lot about education, they travel around the world, they believe a lot in social [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=412.24s)]
*  justice. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=416.2s)]
*  And even though the hierarchy isn't necessarily what interests him, he climbs the hierarchy. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=417.2s)]
*  And eventually he becomes the Cardinal of Buenos Aires, which is a huge figure in Argentina, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=422.6s)]
*  a huge figure within South America. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=428.52s)]
*  And stories start being told about this Cardinal in Buenos Aires, who is a little bit different. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  And I was covering the Vatican back then, and I remember there was this image of him [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  which made the rounds. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=441.84s)]
*  And it was this Cardinal taking the bus. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  And that was just something you didn't see much. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  I thought maybe that this is someone to pay attention to. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=447.96s)]
*  So the way that he married these influences of his childhood, his love of neighborhood, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=451.4s)]
*  perhaps some of that bottom-up teaching, with actually being a high-ranking church [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=456.96s)]
*  member, was to do something as simple as taking the bus, making sure that his commute from [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=462.44s)]
*  home to the church is done on public transportation. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Francis, I mean, even before he was Pope Francis, he was sort of a master of gestures. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=471.44s)]
*  It showed his flock, the entire country, that he didn't think that he was better than them. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=477.0s)]
*  That was a talent he had. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=482.28s)]
*  So how does he become not just this quirky master of the gesture Cardinal, but actually [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=483.64s)]
*  the Pope? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=490.24s)]
*  So I think it's important to remember where the church was in 2013, the year Francis became [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=491.24s)]
*  Pope. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  It had been governed and led for decades by a very conservative streak. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  And the Pope at the time was Benedict XVI, who had been the keeper of the orthodoxy, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=503.52s)]
*  the guardian of the church's doctrine. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=509.2s)]
*  And he retired, which shocked the entire world. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=512.08s)]
*  Right, Popes don't retire. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=514.72s)]
*  Right, it was a shock. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=515.72s)]
*  And the question is, okay, where's the church going to go now? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=517.4000000000001s)]
*  And so now maybe the church needed to try something new. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=520.48s)]
*  It had been with the Italians for centuries. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=525.12s)]
*  Then it tried Europe. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  And so the idea was, well, these Cardinals were probably going to look elsewhere from [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=530.9200000000001s)]
*  Europe. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=535.32s)]
*  And so the way it works is before the conclave begins... [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=536.32s)]
*  And conclave, we should just say, is the kind of election ritual of the Catholic Church. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=538.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=543.16s)]
*  It means with the key. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=544.16s)]
*  They lock them in with a key so that they can't come out until they pick a new Pope. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=545.16s)]
*  But there's a small timeframe before that begins in which the Cardinals can sort of... [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=549.2s)]
*  It's not campaigning because you're not allowed to campaign and campaign is definitely frowned [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=554.16s)]
*  upon, but you can give speeches about what you think is most important for the church. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=558.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=562.84s)]
*  And so this, Bergoglio of the time, gives this speech, which is very short. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=564.72s)]
*  And basically what he says is we have closed the Badoerian on ourselves. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  We are so self-referential. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=573.26s)]
*  It's time not just for us to open the windows and let fresh air in, it's time for us to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  get out. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=579.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=580.44s)]
*  We have got to get out of the church and go to what he calls the peripheries. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=581.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  So far away, we need to go where people are. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  We need to sort of be on the streets with these people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=588.2s)]
*  And he means it sort of literally, right? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=591.12s)]
*  He wants priests to get out of their churches and go talk to people. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=593.56s)]
*  But he also means it's time for us to stop being so obsessed with ourselves and go talk [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=597.64s)]
*  to people and deal with the lives they're actually living. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=603.0s)]
*  We need to go to them to show them that we care and show them why we think that this [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  is the best way to live. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  And that speech really sort of knocks everyone's socks off. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=613.88s)]
*  And they decide when they go into the conclave, this is the guy who's going to lead us. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=618.04s)]
*  Were you there in Vatican City when he was named Pope? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=624.36s)]
*  I was. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=628.32s)]
*  I was in St. Peter's Square. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=629.32s)]
*  Annuncio vobis Gaudium Mainum. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=631.0s)]
*  Habemus Papam. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=635.4s)]
*  And I remember that they announced the Pope's name in Latin. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=639.6s)]
*  Qui sibi nomen imposuit Franciscum. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=643.4s)]
*  What was also very important, I think, is the name he took. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=652.48s)]
*  So he's the first Pope ever to take the name Francis, who's a 13th century saint who is [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=654.92s)]
*  known for being extremely humble and vows of poverty. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=661.5600000000001s)]
*  And by taking the name Francis, that was, again, this is a master of gestures, already [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=667.2s)]
*  a strong sign to his fellow cardinals and to the world that his priorities were going [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=672.4s)]
*  to be different. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=678.6s)]
*  One of the things I remember is that as soon as he came out onto the balcony, he was just [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=682.12s)]
*  more colloquial. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=690.6s)]
*  And one of the first things he said is like, you know, good evening. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=693.24s)]
*  Buonasera. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=698.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=699.68s)]
*  And it just it seemed less sort of like a regal address to the masses below him. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=700.68s)]
*  And someone who people could relate to. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=711.7199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=714.52s)]
*  I remember watching this all, hearing those details you were just describing and starting [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=715.52s)]
*  to think, oh, something interesting is going on here inside the Catholic Church. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=721.28s)]
*  But I assume this was the case with many people reserving judgment, because this is an incredibly [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  traditional rule bound institution. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=732.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=734.52s)]
*  And he's doing all these things that symbolically say, wow, something's totally different here. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=735.52s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=740.76s)]
*  This is an institution. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=741.76s)]
*  So the question was, you know, was this all style or was there going to be substance here? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=743.24s)]
*  So right away, he says something which completely shocks the world, which is what he's asked [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=747.6s)]
*  about gay priests. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=753.88s)]
*  And he says, who am I to judge? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=755.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=757.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, this is the pope. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  And the answer is, for the past many centuries, you're exactly the person to judge. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=764.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=765.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=766.0s)]
*  This is the pope. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=767.0s)]
*  This is the guy. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=768.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=769.2s)]
*  And he says, but you know, that's not what I'm here for. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=770.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=773.84s)]
*  And eyes go wide when he says that. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=774.84s)]
*  And people start saying, well, wait a minute, maybe this is something really different here. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=776.68s)]
*  So there's tons of these little things and sometimes not so little things. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=781.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=785.12s)]
*  You start saying, if you're a married, divorced person in the church, maybe you can receive [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=786.12s)]
*  communion again. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=790.44s)]
*  And now that's been a no-no. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=791.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=792.44s)]
*  That's against the doctrine. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=793.44s)]
*  And then is all of a sudden paying attention to Rome, where you have this guy who is really [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=794.96s)]
*  turning the church on its head. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=799.96s)]
*  And people start talking about something called the Francis effect. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=802.72s)]
*  Are all these people going to start coming back to the church and filling the pews because [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=805.9200000000001s)]
*  they love Francis so much? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=810.08s)]
*  And then the sort of the policy questions start arising, especially from people who [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=811.76s)]
*  have been out in the cold for a long time in the Catholic church. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=816.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=819.2s)]
*  People who want married priests, people who want women to be priests, people who want [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=820.2s)]
*  all sorts of things are saying, wait, maybe this is the guy who's going to finally change [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=824.2s)]
*  things. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=828.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=829.76s)]
*  Maybe a revolution is genuinely afoot in this most unrevolutionary institution. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=830.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=836.2s)]
*  And he feels very much like a man of the moment. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=837.2s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=840.36s)]
*  At that time, you have Barack Obama in the White House, you have Angela Merkel in Germany, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=841.36s)]
*  you have liberal leaders across Europe. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=845.88s)]
*  You have this feeling that there's this migration crisis and it's time to help these people. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=848.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=852.8000000000001s)]
*  We've got to find a solution to this. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=854.52s)]
*  As many European nations debate tougher immigration policies, Pope Francis has highlighted the [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=855.7199999999999s)]
*  value of migrants. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=861.0999999999999s)]
*  Earlier, Francis urged a joint meeting of Congress to reject what he called a mindset [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=862.0999999999999s)]
*  of hostility towards refugees and undocumented immigrants. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=866.52s)]
*  It becomes a beacon on issues like climate change, which he cares deeply about. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  With the global gathering of Catholic bishops as a backdrop, Pope Francis warned the world [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=877.0799999999999s)]
*  is approaching the point of no return on climate. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=881.8s)]
*  He urged decisive acceleration to renewable energies and away from oil and gas. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=884.88s)]
*  So on that, on questions of human rights and human dignity. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=890.4399999999999s)]
*  Pope Francis is the pope of mercy. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=894.7199999999999s)]
*  He's the pope of the poor. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=896.4399999999999s)]
*  He's the pope that visits inmates. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=898.24s)]
*  And he seems very much to be on the forefront of all of this. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=900.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=905.56s)]
*  He's not just a spiritual leader stuck in the Vatican. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=906.56s)]
*  He's a global player. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=910.1999999999999s)]
*  His Twitter account at Pontifex ranks in the top five most searched words on the Internet. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  And he's everywhere. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=917.28s)]
*  Time magazine names Pope Francis as its person of the year. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=918.28s)]
*  Time calls the Holy Father a septuagenarian superstar. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  It's hard to overstate how big a deal Francis was. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=925.08s)]
*  All over the world, everyone felt it, but especially if you were someone covering the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=929.64s)]
*  Vatican, which had sort of become sleepy and irrelevant in a way to the big discussions [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=933.8000000000001s)]
*  going on. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=939.6s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you know, the Roman Catholic Church had a leader who was not [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=940.6s)]
*  just at the table, but in some ways, you know, was sort of dictating the agenda. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=945.8000000000001s)]
*  But while he's sort of getting all this adoration within the church itself, there starts to [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=950.48s)]
*  be a feeling that not just of bemusement, but of real concern amongst conservatives [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=957.48s)]
*  that wait a minute, is this guy actually going to start changing the rules of the church? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=964.0s)]
*  The rules of the church isn't just sort of legislation, right? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  It's the truth for them. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=973.24s)]
*  And so the idea that you would have a pope who is extremely popular using that popularity [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=975.4s)]
*  to change doctrine, what they care most about, starts really causing a lot of fear within [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  conservative circles and a backlash starts building. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=989.88s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1000.0400000000001s)]
*  Jason, talk about this backlash that you just mentioned, which I think means talking through [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1012.12s)]
*  what changes Pope Francis brings to the day-to-day operations and teachings of the church itself, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1017.72s)]
*  not just the things he's saying to the outside world. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1026.68s)]
*  There's a saying in the Vatican that personnel is policy. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1029.68s)]
*  And one of the first things that Francis starts doing is getting rid of people. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1034.76s)]
*  And so the guy who is in charge of the office that protects the doctrine, the congregation [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1039.8400000000001s)]
*  for the doctrine of the faith, it's called, he gets fired. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1045.64s)]
*  There's an American Cardinal named Raymond Burke, who's the head of what is essentially [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1049.28s)]
*  the Supreme Court of the Vatican. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1053.3200000000002s)]
*  He's kicked off. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1055.64s)]
*  All these figures who are sort of the favorite heroes of the traditionalists and the conservatives [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1056.96s)]
*  and the church, the heads start rolling. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1063.0s)]
*  This is looking like a real kind of traditionalist housecleaning. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  It is a bit of a housecleaning is what's going on. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1069.24s)]
*  And these are figures who, especially in the case of Burke, one of his positions was he [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1072.0800000000002s)]
*  was on something called the Congregation of Bishops. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1076.44s)]
*  And what they do is they pick the next generation of bishops. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1079.0s)]
*  So that's a big deal, right? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1082.0400000000002s)]
*  Because that means that all the clergy and all the bishops who really run things for [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1084.44s)]
*  the next generation are going to be of a different mindset. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1089.04s)]
*  And that mindset becomes clear is much less traditional and is much more open to debate [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1092.68s)]
*  and much more pastoral. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1099.2s)]
*  And that's sort of the guiding word for Francis, pastoral. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1100.76s)]
*  And again, it goes back to the very beginnings with him. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1104.8s)]
*  And he just wants a bishop and he wants a priest who's going to be with people and helping [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1107.36s)]
*  them work things out. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1112.4s)]
*  He doesn't want somebody shaking their finger at a parishioner and saying, no, no, you [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1113.6s)]
*  can't do that. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1118.04s)]
*  That's not what we do here. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1118.56s)]
*  And so that turns out to be a major shift. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's not changing the laws of the church, the doctrine. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  What was doctrine the day before Francis got in is still doctrine now. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1127.28s)]
*  But even if it's not changing the laws, the people who love the laws start thinking that [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1131.6s)]
*  this is a gigantic threat to that old mindset. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1137.12s)]
*  And what is the reaction among those who see this as a threat? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1142.08s)]
*  You know, at first they give them some time, you know, they give them a couple of years. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1146.56s)]
*  And then they start saying, well, this is really dangerous. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1150.32s)]
*  And a couple of them start speaking out. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1152.76s)]
*  It's very, very unusual to challenge the pope if you're a cardinal. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1155.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  And the whole thing is basically a hierarchy that's based on the idea that the pope is [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1160.9199999999998s)]
*  in charge and that you might agree, you might disagree. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1166.1599999999999s)]
*  But if you disagree, you probably don't go out and say something because he's the pope. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1169.84s)]
*  That changes. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1175.04s)]
*  The conservatives are so upset and they're so worried that Francis is going to wreck [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1176.52s)]
*  the church that they start even sending in these complicated technical Vatican things [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1180.84s)]
*  called dubias, which are questions. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1186.1999999999998s)]
*  And what they're doing is they're questioning the Francis's own understanding of what he's [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1187.8799999999999s)]
*  doing. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1192.9199999999998s)]
*  They're saying, you said this thing. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1193.72s)]
*  Do you really know what you're talking about? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1195.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1196.9199999999998s)]
*  And so Francis, who's very politically savvy, responds in a way that drives them crazy, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1197.48s)]
*  which is he doesn't even deign to respond. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1205.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1207.3600000000001s)]
*  He ignores them completely. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1208.1200000000001s)]
*  Drives them nuts. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1209.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1210.4s)]
*  Because he doesn't want to give them oxygen, is what I think is what it was. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1211.92s)]
*  At the time, they're a small but noisy, if somewhat powerful within the Vatican group. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1216.72s)]
*  But he knows he is wildly popular figure around the world. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1222.04s)]
*  He's wildly popular, especially with rank and file Catholics. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1227.84s)]
*  Regular Catholics adore him because they see him as caring about them. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1233.0s)]
*  And so why would he all of a sudden get into a theological argument with a conservative [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1238.4s)]
*  opposition group within the church, which is not what he sees himself there for? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1245.0s)]
*  So he ignores them. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1250.52s)]
*  But while he ignores them, they don't go away. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1251.6s)]
*  They keep building momentum. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1254.1599999999999s)]
*  And many of them happen to be American because the American church is extremely conservative, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1257.12s)]
*  traditionally very conservative. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1262.9199999999998s)]
*  And in America, there is a lot of money and there is a lot of media. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1264.6799999999998s)]
*  And those two things amplify the opposition to Francis. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1269.24s)]
*  The pope is the vicar of Christ on earth, full stop. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1273.48s)]
*  However, when he goes and talks about politics, that doesn't deal with theology or the church [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1277.12s)]
*  or infallibility. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1285.6s)]
*  And it becomes also very much attached to and married to populist politics. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1287.1599999999999s)]
*  So you have people like Steve Bannon coming to Rome. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1292.36s)]
*  The pope has been consistent that all the problems in the world are because of this [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1295.84s)]
*  populist nationalist movement. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1300.56s)]
*  He's using his outlets to try and amplify the messages that are coming out of the conservative [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1303.64s)]
*  American church. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1310.1200000000001s)]
*  And it ends up being this sort of strange ecosystem with a common target, and that is [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1311.68s)]
*  Francis. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1316.88s)]
*  So Pope Francis should stop worrying about the criticism of Donald Trump, and he should [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1317.88s)]
*  start to worry about this crisis in the Catholic church. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1322.56s)]
*  It keeps getting bigger and bigger. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1327.72s)]
*  I remember being in a basement of a hotel where all the entire opposition to Francis, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1329.8s)]
*  essentially, within the Vatican had gathered. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1337.0s)]
*  And there was Cardinal Burke on the dais. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1340.04s)]
*  He basically said that we have a problem where we think the pope might be a heretic. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1342.4s)]
*  He couches his language. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1347.16s)]
*  That's an extraordinary thing to suggest. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1348.16s)]
*  And it wasn't unusual in that crowd. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  They had basically become convinced that, oh, we have a major problem here. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1354.0s)]
*  We have a pope who doesn't believe in what the Catholic church believes in. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1358.12s)]
*  Allegations of cover-up come to the Vatican, and Pope Francis remains mum. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1363.1999999999998s)]
*  Then eventually you have actually accusations levied against Francis, accusing him of knowing [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1368.6799999999998s)]
*  about child sexual abuse and hiding it. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1376.6s)]
*  In a bombshell letter, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano urges Pope Francis to resign over what [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1379.9199999999998s)]
*  he calls a conspiracy of silence about McCarrick. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1384.76s)]
*  And it ends up being a full-on sort of revolt against Francis. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1388.04s)]
*  He tries to stay above it, but I remember I asked him once on a flight. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1398.6399999999999s)]
*  I said, you know, these people, they can't stand you, and they're talking about breaking [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1403.96s)]
*  apart from the church. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1408.6399999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1410.32s)]
*  I mean, what's your opinion about this? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1411.32s)]
*  And he basically said something that I thought was really interesting. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1413.8799999999999s)]
*  He said, look, the history of the church is very, very long. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1416.52s)]
*  There's been lots of schisms, right? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1420.4s)]
*  These people breaking apart. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1422.04s)]
*  I hope they don't do it, but if they do it, and he sort of shrugged and he said, then [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1423.56s)]
*  they do it. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1427.48s)]
*  I'm not scared. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1428.48s)]
*  In other words, he's saying, you know, have a party, guys. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1429.48s)]
*  If you really want to break away off on this, maybe... [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1432.2s)]
*  He's daring them. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1436.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1437.44s)]
*  He was saying like he was playing chicken with them. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1438.44s)]
*  Because on some level, he knows they're probably not going to do it. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1440.44s)]
*  They're probably not going to do it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1443.44s)]
*  And it's also not what he thinks it's about. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1444.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1448.0s)]
*  He thinks that this is a distraction from doing the mission of the church, which is [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1449.0s)]
*  going out and being pastors to people who need their help. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1454.04s)]
*  So Jason, as this revolt, as you're describing it, is playing out among the conservative [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1456.96s)]
*  wings of the church, I'm curious how the progressive side of the ledger is seeing Pope Francis. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1461.3200000000002s)]
*  Because the things you're describing, the personnel changes that he's making, I'm guessing [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1468.66s)]
*  that they don't satisfy the appetite for change among progressives who want big sweeping [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1473.32s)]
*  changes around issues like who can be a priest and who can take communion. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1482.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1487.36s)]
*  I think what these initial sort of symbolic changes that Francis does, that what they [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1488.36s)]
*  do is they wet the appetite of liberals in the Catholic Church and they who start thinking, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1493.32s)]
*  oh my God, this guy's actually going to make huge changes. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1497.96s)]
*  They're waiting and then they're waiting some more. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1502.16s)]
*  And I think it starts dawning on liberals that maybe he's actually not going to change [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1505.08s)]
*  anything and that maybe this is actually symbolic. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1510.52s)]
*  And the very things that upset the conservatives, in a way also upset the liberals because it's [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1514.64s)]
*  not enough for the liberals. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1521.88s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1523.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1524.96s)]
*  What's the definition of not enough? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1525.96s)]
*  Well, if you look across the board, there are things where he seemed to walk right up [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1526.96s)]
*  to the line on. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1529.9s)]
*  For example, remember when we talked about divorce, it seemed like he had opened the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1530.9s)]
*  door, he was going to walk right through it. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1534.42s)]
*  Instead, all he did was crack open the door. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1536.3000000000002s)]
*  He never actually made the change. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1538.22s)]
*  But then even on sort of the hot button topics of the Catholic Church, such as women becoming [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1540.52s)]
*  priests, no movement on that, women becoming deacons, he closes the door on that as well. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1547.66s)]
*  He allows a little bit of debate, but it's debate that he's allowing and he's not changing [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1554.26s)]
*  the rules. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1558.38s)]
*  So at a certain point, it starts dawning on liberals in the church that, wait a minute, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1559.44s)]
*  maybe this guy's actually not going to change anything. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1564.4s)]
*  Maybe this is all about sort of redirecting the ship, but where are we going to go? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1566.66s)]
*  Is he going to move it forward? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  Why do you think that he wasn't willing to use this extraordinary authority he has to [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1575.3200000000002s)]
*  make these kinds of changes? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1581.48s)]
*  I mean, if he's willing to say to the US conservative wing of the Catholic Church, you know, I'm [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1582.72s)]
*  sorry you don't like it if you need to break off, break off. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1589.18s)]
*  If he's willing to do that, why not make some of the changes that it felt like in his heart [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1592.14s)]
*  he might have wanted to make? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1598.02s)]
*  Or is that a misreading of it? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1599.5s)]
*  Is it the case that he actually didn't want to see these changes? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1601.26s)]
*  Or was he worried that he might take the church someplace it wasn't ready to go? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1603.68s)]
*  I think that the important way to see this and the important way France saw this is that [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1609.3400000000001s)]
*  the church is much bigger than Europe and the United States. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1613.94s)]
*  The future of the church, if you look around, is in Africa, it is in Asia, and if you make [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1618.66s)]
*  these big changes, right, you are going to lose a lot of people. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1624.38s)]
*  So on LGBTQ Catholics, right, which was a major issue for especially for people in the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1629.14s)]
*  United States and Europe, he opened the church, right? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1634.7s)]
*  He let people in, but he wouldn't change the rules. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1639.16s)]
*  Maybe because in Africa, homosexuality amongst Catholics is viewed very, very negatively. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1642.02s)]
*  What Europe or the United States would view as progress would be viewed as a deal breaker [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1650.26s)]
*  for the place that actually has people and has the future of the church, right? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1655.1399999999999s)]
*  So I think if there was a conservative argument that France came to understand or accept was [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1660.18s)]
*  the unity of the church was extremely important. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1668.46s)]
*  And maybe he didn't want to be the guy who destroyed the whole thing over what might [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1671.4199999999998s)]
*  in a way be an interest group, a Western liberal interest group. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1677.6399999999999s)]
*  And I think really what he believes is that he believes that the church is going to be [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1682.5s)]
*  around a long time. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1687.26s)]
*  And what he did is he opened up these debates and he wants the church to reach a sort of [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1689.1399999999999s)]
*  consensus on these things so that it can move together. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1693.9399999999998s)]
*  Now that's really hard, right? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1697.38s)]
*  Because the world's a big place with lots of different views and lots of different Catholics. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1699.5s)]
*  He thinks differently. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1702.9s)]
*  But I think that he thinks to make those big changes to doctrine and to law, you want everyone [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1704.24s)]
*  to be on board or at least a consensus that you feel like you're not going to break the [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1709.66s)]
*  church apart. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1713.5s)]
*  Jason, listening to you talk, I'm thinking of that phrase you used at the beginning of [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1714.5s)]
*  our conversation about the dividing line over Francis. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1717.94s)]
*  And in hearing you talk about what Francis was willing to let upset conservatives and [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1722.38s)]
*  liberals, the through line seems to be a desire to make sure that the largest number of Catholics [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1728.7s)]
*  possible in the fastest growing places in the world end up seeing the church as relevant. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1737.7s)]
*  And if something doesn't do that, he doesn't really want to be a part of it. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1746.26s)]
*  And if someone stands in his way of something that might do that, he would dismiss them. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1749.54s)]
*  Am I getting that right? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1754.78s)]
*  I think you're right that he's got a very tricky balancing act, right? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1756.42s)]
*  I think for Francis, it's not just about being relevant, which he desperately wants the church [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1760.3s)]
*  to be relevant in the lives of Catholics all around the world. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1764.34s)]
*  But it's not just to be about being relevant in the fastest growing places or the places [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1767.42s)]
*  where the future of the church is. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1771.42s)]
*  I think for Francis, he also wants to make sure that the Catholics in Europe and the [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1773.02s)]
*  United States are still part of this giant mission. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1778.58s)]
*  But I think what he has little patience for, and I think this is where he ran into trouble [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1782.22s)]
*  with some of the American conservatives, is what he views as ideological or politically [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1787.42s)]
*  motivated dissent. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1793.44s)]
*  I think when he senses that the motivation behind this has more to do with power, more [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1795.3799999999999s)]
*  to do with the word he uses, which he hates more than anything is clericalism, the idea [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1802.86s)]
*  that a priest is higher than his flock, it turns him off immediately. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1808.1s)]
*  And I think that's what he was trying to sort of rid the church of. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1813.1s)]
*  Well, Jason, the really complex portrait you are presenting here is of a pope who inspires [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1817.1399999999999s)]
*  both the progressive and conservative wings of the Catholic Church to think things that [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1825.9599999999998s)]
*  don't really come to pass. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1832.2199999999998s)]
*  The progressive wing thinks that Francis is going to be this revolutionary figure who [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1834.82s)]
*  delivers decades worth of changes in a short period, and he doesn't on all kinds of fronts. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1841.02s)]
*  And then the conservative wing is suspicious of him in this profound way, thinks he's going [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1849.12s)]
*  to tear the church apart and break all its traditions, and he doesn't do that either. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1853.9199999999998s)]
*  So in a sense, he lets down both sides. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1859.46s)]
*  In that sense, what exactly is his legacy when we think about that concept you brought [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1863.66s)]
*  up at the very beginning of this dividing line and where he sits on it? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1868.4s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1872.5800000000002s)]
*  I think in many ways he's sort of the pope of great expectations that are never fulfilled [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1873.74s)]
*  on either side. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1879.5400000000002s)]
*  And that doesn't mean, though, that he didn't do anything, right? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1881.5800000000002s)]
*  I think that even though he doesn't change the rules that many liberals were hoping for, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1886.66s)]
*  and that he doesn't break the place, which is what many conservatives were worried about, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1892.82s)]
*  I think that he does something that's really important, which is he sort of changes the [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1898.26s)]
*  priorities or the idea of what the Catholic Church is around for, right? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1903.5s)]
*  And that, I think, was the thing that was most important to him. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1909.98s)]
*  And his supporters would argue that he did a pretty good job of changing people's minds, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1913.7s)]
*  or at least some people's minds, about what the Church is here for. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1918.7s)]
*  And it's pretty simple. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1922.7800000000002s)]
*  His idea of the Church was just, it's full of priests and nuns and all these people in [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1924.3200000000002s)]
*  the institution who are there for people and to bring the faith closer to the people. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1929.46s)]
*  And everything else is sort of a distraction. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1935.5400000000002s)]
*  And that seems really basic. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1937.96s)]
*  But he would argue, I think, that, yeah, it's basic and that's not what we were doing. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1941.58s)]
*  For decades, we were so obsessed with how we dressed and which way we faced when we [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1948.6599999999999s)]
*  said this prayer and what prayer we said that we forgot what we were here for. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1955.58s)]
*  And so I think what his entire pontificate was really about was reminding people why [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1961.1s)]
*  the Church exists in his view. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1965.9799999999998s)]
*  And it's a big ship, the Catholic Church, right? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1968.94s)]
*  It's 1.3 billion people. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1971.46s)]
*  It's been around for 2,000 years. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1973.22s)]
*  It's not easy to make big changes. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1975.5s)]
*  There's an enormous bureaucracy that tries to stop change. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1977.66s)]
*  But I think that he moved things enough that it's very hard to say he did nothing. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1981.3400000000001s)]
*  He also opened up debates, which is something that now people forget. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1988.22s)]
*  There were things you could not talk about. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1993.64s)]
*  And more, do you remember when I said that within the Church personnel is policy? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1995.98s)]
*  Well, Francis named a lot of new cardinals and a lot of new bishops. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=1999.6200000000001s)]
*  And those people tend to see the Church the way that Francis does. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2005.42s)]
*  Which means that going forward in the future, the people picking the next pope within a [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2009.58s)]
*  couple of weeks are going to be people who see the Church more like Francis does, who [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2016.94s)]
*  probably want more of a pastor than someone who's going to be defending doctrine and rules. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2021.86s)]
*  I mean, what you're describing is a kind of great seeding of future change by a pope who [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2030.2199999999998s)]
*  didn't necessarily make the big changes himself. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2036.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think what Francis ultimately decided is that he was not going to be the guy who [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2040.02s)]
*  was going to make the change, but he was going to create the circumstances, the ability [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2046.54s)]
*  to discuss things, but also the personnel, the actual people who might be more willing, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2052.7599999999998s)]
*  even than he was, to make the actual changes. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2059.16s)]
*  So I mean, when people look back now at Francis, was it a revolution that he led? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2062.14s)]
*  Maybe not, but I think it's very hard to argue that he didn't make a big change within the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2068.54s)]
*  Catholic Church. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2073.22s)]
*  Jason, thank you very much. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2076.54s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2081.42s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Michael. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2082.42s)]
*  On Monday night, my colleague Emma Bavola spoke to some of those who had come to St. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2103.86s)]
*  Peter's Square in order to honor and mourn Pope Francis. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2109.9s)]
*  How do you feel today that he's gone? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2115.7000000000003s)]
*  I think the world has lost a very important person, but it was coming. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2118.58s)]
*  Well, he was a breath of fresh air. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2123.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh, he is a very good guy. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2125.7000000000003s)]
*  He has a good heart. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2128.6600000000003s)]
*  Very giving and generous. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLEJ5BVTRYk&t=2130.86s)]
