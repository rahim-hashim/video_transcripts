# 'Animal,' Episode 4: Ferrets
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyVPBTRMAdg)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Today we have something really special for you.
*  A blissful break from the news.
*  It's a new series from NYT Audio called Animal.
*  My colleague Sam Anderson from the Times Magazine traveled the world to have encounters with
*  animals.
*  Not to claim them or to tame them, but just to appreciate them.
*  Each episode is a journey to get closer to a creature that Sam loves.
*  For the next six weeks, we'll be running this limited series every Sunday here on the
*  Daily Feed.
*  But if you want to hear all the episodes right now, you can search for it wherever you get
*  your podcasts.
*  Today, episode four.
*  Hope you like it.
*  Where are we?
*  Is this actually where?
*  Yeah, I think we're here.
*  This looks pretty sketchy.
*  Turn right into the parking lot, then arrive at your destination.
*  What?
*  What do you see?
*  That license plate.
*  The license plate says ferret.
*  What?
*  What?
*  What are you pointing at?
*  Oh my God, that license plate says I love my ferrets.
*  Ah!
*  It's happening.
*  My people.
*  Okay, let's go check in.
*  I'm going to be honest with you.
*  I'm a middle-aged man.
*  My life is dull and soft.
*  I'm basically a human butter knife.
*  But there's one thing that instantly fills me with joy.
*  Giddy, squeaky, childlike joy.
*  I found my people.
*  They're loading up a cart full of ferret products.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sam Anderson.
*  This is Animal, episode four, ferrets.
*  How many ferrets were in that van?
*  I saw it.
*  Oh, we're not done yet.
*  I'm done.
*  It's August, and I've just arrived with my colleague, Crystal Duhame, in Columbus, Ohio,
*  which at this moment happens to be the most ferret-y place in America.
*  Because ferret enthusiasts from all over the country are pouring in for one of the
*  major stops on the national ferret circuit, a competition called the Ferret Buckeye Bash.
*  Basically imagine the prestige of the Westminster Dog Show, but instead of beagles and Pomeranians,
*  it's just hundreds of ferrets.
*  As we're standing in the lobby of the official competition hotel, a woman walks in rolling
*  a luggage cart stacked with cages.
*  There's brown ferrets, albino ferrets, ferrets lounging around in miniature hammocks and
*  snuggled up in comfy little beds.
*  This is Phineas Weaselton.
*  He's really long.
*  Did you say Phineas Weaselton?
*  Yeah.
*  And before I know it, I'm helping her and her ferret friends unload.
*  A ferret, for anyone who doesn't know, is basically a weasel.
*  It's long and tubular, sort of like a badger crossed with a snake, but also crossed with
*  a teddy bear.
*  What am I seeing in the cage that these ferrets are eating?
*  Raw meat.
*  Well, this is salad and chewies over here.
*  Some of the cages we're unloading are littered with bones and carcasses of like, whole dead
*  birds.
*  Why is this ferret bald?
*  They have adrenal disease, which is common, especially in marshal ferrets.
*  This might be the place to mention that ferrets can be pretty polarizing pets.
*  People who love them, like me, really love them.
*  People who don't love them, which is probably most of humanity, really do not love them.
*  Wait, what happens if I put my fingers in that bottom cage?
*  He will probably bite you.
*  To the bone.
*  To the bone?
*  What?
*  What?
*  The word ferret comes from the Latin for little thief.
*  They were domesticated basically yesterday, historically speaking, around 2,500 years
*  ago.
*  Just for reference, dogs were domesticated more like 20,000 years ago.
*  And ferrets were mainly used to hunt rodents and rabbits.
*  They have sharp claws and oily fur and glands that make them smell weird and also extremely
*  strong jaws, which they are not at all afraid to use.
*  In fact, this is part of why ferrets are actually illegal to keep as pets in a couple of states.
*  But in spite of all that, I have loved ferrets my whole life.
*  As a kid growing up in Oregon, I desperately wanted one.
*  They were at all the pet stores I went to.
*  And I'd go running past the gerbils and hamsters and parakeets and just stand there with the
*  ferrets, communing for as long as I could, letting them bite my fingers through the cage.
*  But I was never allowed to take one home.
*  And here's the thing, unfulfilled childhood dreams, they don't just die.
*  I might go home this weekend with some ferrets.
*  They follow you around and scratch at you and burrow a hole deep into your heart.
*  We'll see you guys around.
*  Hey, how are you?
*  Are you guys checking in?
*  Yeah.
*  Walking?
*  Which is why I've come all the way here to the official hotel of the Ferret Buckeye Bash.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Because this hotel is filling up fast with chaotic ferrets and ferret people.
*  One of whom has agreed to help fulfill my childhood dream by initiating me into the
*  ferret lifestyle.
*  Hello.
*  Hey.
*  Please come in.
*  Oh, look at this guy.
*  Hi.
*  This is Millie Mildred.
*  Hi.
*  Look at this lady.
*  But the first ferret we meet is actually a large dog.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Yeah, I just adopted her on Tuesday, so we're still kind of getting to know each other.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, I'm Sam.
*  Hi, I'm Erin.
*  Erin Erman just drove here from upstate New York many hours in her tiny car with not only
*  Millie, her newly adopted dog, but also her friend Karen and of course her ferrets, whose
*  cages are now wedged around the room.
*  There's one by the microwave, one by the coffee maker.
*  Well, should we meet some buddies?
*  Yeah, you can.
*  This is Erin's first time competing in the Buckeye Bash.
*  Yes, this is me.
*  Genesis.
*  Genesis.
*  Genesis looks exactly like the ferret of my childhood dreams.
*  She's gorgeous, right?
*  Yeah.
*  What a beauty.
*  Actually, you want to hold her?
*  Uh-huh.
*  Thanks, baby.
*  Thanks, my ferret.
*  She's so slithery.
*  You know that classic thing they do in movies when they want to show something is beautiful?
*  The shaft of heavenly light pouring down, angel choir singing.
*  Well, a majestic heavenly light is not worthy of Genesis.
*  If you really wanted to signify the spectacular, otherworldly beauty of Genesis, you'd have
*  to make a shaft of little Genesises pouring down from the sky.
*  Genesis is really checking me out.
*  I'm really being stared at.
*  She is probably my favorite.
*  She don't tell the others.
*  Genesis is also the key to Erin's ferret future, because Erin wants to breed ferrets.
*  So if I could have just a whole line of ferrets that have her temperament and her structure,
*  I'd be very happy with that.
*  She's such a sweet face.
*  I know.
*  So is she your big hope for the competition, Genesis?
*  For him, he's just going to show because he's going to show.
*  This is when we turn our attention to the other competitor in the room.
*  So this is Gooseberry.
*  He is.
*  Gooseberry.
*  The yin to Genesis's yang.
*  Goose.
*  Born in March.
*  Mr. Goose.
*  This ferret is light brown and weirdly small.
*  But he's still a juvenile, so.
*  And where Genesis is calm and thoughtful and seems to be reciting poetry in her mind, Gooseberry
*  is an absolute freak.
*  He's trying.
*  He's trying his darndest to get out.
*  He won't stop moving, thrashing around in circles, biting the bars of his cage.
*  What are you doing, crazy?
*  What are you doing with your cloths?
*  Gooseberry is of Hungarian descent.
*  And at six months old, he's technically an adolescent hob, or in human terms, a teenaged male.
*  Ow.
*  Oh.
*  You got me good.
*  You are a nut.
*  Did he try to take a bite out of the mic?
*  He grabbed the mic with his paw.
*  Mine.
*  What kind of animal acts like this?
*  A ferret.
*  As Gooseberry works on destroying his cage, there's a knock on the door.
*  This is just chaos everywhere.
*  Sorry, we'll be quick.
*  I know you have to apply.
*  No problem.
*  The pigs will give you baby's paperwork and baby's food.
*  It's a ferret delivery.
*  I had no idea you could get a ferret delivered like a pizza.
*  I'll see you tomorrow.
*  Okay.
*  So this is the first time I'm meeting this guy.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Hey, buddy.
*  Oh, you have a pretty head.
*  Yes, you do.
*  Oh, he is a beauty.
*  He is a beauty, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, gentle.
*  Very nice.
*  Very sweet boy.
*  He's biting you sweetly?
*  Yeah.
*  Why are you into ferrets?
*  When did you first encounter a ferret?
*  Okay, so I grew up in California and they're not legal there.
*  So I didn't actually come into contact with a ferret until I was an adult and moved out of California.
*  I didn't hold one until 2019 and the first one I held was Mr. Groot Groot and I had to have him.
*  As soon as I held him, I just kind of knew that's what I wanted.
*  I don't know how else to explain it.
*  Some people say that there's like a dog shaped hole in their heart or a cat shaped hole.
*  So I guess it would be like a ferret shaped hole.
*  A ferret would get right into that hole.
*  Exactly.
*  I also have a ferret shaped hole in my heart.
*  My childhood was kind of chaotic.
*  There was a divorce and a bunch of step parents and we always seemed to be moving,
*  including a big move from Oregon to California where ferrets are illegal.
*  And so every summer when I'd go back up to Oregon to live with my dad,
*  I would see the ferrets in the pet stores and I would beg him to get me one.
*  And he would say, no.
*  And in my little tiny child mind, everything would have been fine if I could have just had a pet ferret.
*  I think they're grounding for me.
*  Grounding.
*  Which is ironic because they're very crazy, right?
*  They're kind of off the wall.
*  But it's like you really have to be there with them.
*  Yeah, you have to be in the moment.
*  They're very in the present moment.
*  I do have a hard time being in the moment myself.
*  Like I'm usually thinking about either the past or the future and I miss the moment.
*  But not with them.
*  You have to be in the moment with them.
*  They demand it.
*  So he's being silly, isn't he?
*  He turned himself upside down and bit the bar.
*  It's like hanging upside down from it.
*  A ferret is a paradox.
*  It's so chaotic that it wraps all the way around into zen.
*  Absolute chaos forces absolute presence.
*  And so tomorrow, when I am immersed in hundreds of squiggly wiggly ferrets at this show, I'm going to be so freaking present.
*  I might be fully in the moment for the first time in my whole life.
*  All right, we should let everyone get to bed.
*  Thank you so much for letting us hang in the hotel room.
*  And who knows what could happen then.
*  Might have to figure out how to get eight ferrets sleeping in hammocks onto the airplane home and a bunch of dead birds for them to snack on.
*  The
*  breakfast sandwich to Aaron, how do you not have a ferret vanity license plate?
*  I really if I get a SUV or a wagon, I want to call it the Wusel wagon and like have that on the back of it as a detail and I'm like Wusel one of the license plate.
*  The next morning we meet Aaron in a parking lot at the Ohio State Fairgrounds.
*  Oh, I just noticed your earrings.
*  Those are great.
*  Aaron is all decked out in ferret gear, earrings, T-shirt, purple ferret boots.
*  Hey Genesis.
*  Today's your big day.
*  It's the day where you win.
*  Genesis is looking glorious.
*  Yeah, she likes even prettier this morning than she did last night.
*  Now you can see her in the full light.
*  Yeah, really.
*  Look how clean and perfect she is.
*  Gooseberry, you, is also there.
*  I can't even talk to you.
*  He loves you.
*  He's not even biting.
*  I know.
*  He's very calm this morning.
*  He's in game shape.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh no, there he goes.
*  Oh yeah, that's going to happen.
*  There he goes.
*  All right, let's get him checked in.
*  We are a real parade of animals heading toward the hall.
*  Aaron carries Gooseberry, I carry Genesis, and Aaron's friend Karen is walking Millie the dog.
*  How are you?
*  Good.
*  Are we going in that way?
*  That way.
*  But it turns out we're actually too many animals.
*  You know no animals are allowed in here.
*  Dogs are allowed in.
*  No dogs are allowed in.
*  Oh.
*  That's pretty obvious.
*  You can't have a dog in this ferret show hall.
*  Sorry.
*  What are you going to do with him then?
*  The woman in charge of the ferret show, Scarlett, is saying that Millie has to go.
*  That will set all the ferrets off.
*  Okay.
*  We don't want them biting the judge.
*  And as we're standing there clutching our animals, the line behind us starts to back up.
*  Do you know how many ferrets in there don't even know what a dog is?
*  And you know how good their smelling is?
*  And I am finding this extremely stressful.
*  So it sets them off.
*  You need me to do it?
*  I'll do it.
*  This is your gig.
*  This is what you do.
*  That's when Aaron's friend Karen, very stoically, announces that she is going to walk Millie
*  back to the hotel, nine miles.
*  That's a long dog.
*  Halfway across Columbus, Ohio, with this dog she just met.
*  And she takes the leash and just heads off.
*  Okay, where are we?
*  Where did you say we were?
*  Jamie's leg.
*  I'm over somewhere.
*  So with the dog gone and feeling slightly shell shocked, we are finally allowed to enter
*  the hall where we meet up with some of Aaron's ferret friends.
*  This is Roy.
*  Hello.
*  Hey, Roy.
*  Hi, Crystal.
*  Do you feel bad at all about getting yelled at by Scarlett on your way in the door?
*  No.
*  Because I have no idea what's going on.
*  Everybody will be yelled at by Scarlett.
*  Everybody.
*  Yeah, it's just a thing.
*  So she's famous for this.
*  Yeah.
*  She's really nice.
*  She's just very aggressive.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  You just kind of have to take it and keep going.
*  That's kind of perfect because ferret owners are the people who can do that the best, right?
*  Yeah.
*  They actually all take it very well.
*  Yeah.
*  I just nod and smile because I really don't know what the hell is going on.
*  You seem, I have to say, you seem comfortable existing in a level of chaos.
*  I do?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh.
*  You seem chill and stuff's going on all around you.
*  You don't quite know what's going on.
*  Probably because I took my anxiety meds today, so that's good.
*  Okay.
*  You know?
*  I take Lexapro, so I think that's a good thing.
*  You do?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  I had to get mine increased recently, actually.
*  So I'm good now.
*  How many milligrams are you talking?
*  A 20 milligram.
*  Okay, I'm on 10.
*  Good.
*  Yeah.
*  Good times.
*  Yeah, you do seem very chill, though.
*  Like, you're getting yelled at about your dog.
*  You're fine.
*  It is what it is.
*  She's yelling at us about the line.
*  Nobody's going ahead of us.
*  I'm fine.
*  I think that as I get older, I just care less.
*  So that has something to do with it.
*  There is that about getting older that I like.
*  I felt that in my 30s, for sure.
*  Yeah, just kind of, eh, okay.
*  Now I'm in my 40s, I'm hardly even present on this earth.
*  It's like a floating consciousness unaffected by everything around me.
*  Okay.
*  So, okay, what's the plan now?
*  I don't know.
*  I think they start judging at 10, so.
*  Oh, really?
*  I think so.
*  Oh, a schedule.
*  Okay.
*  There are so many ferret categories, just blizzards of categories and subcategories.
*  But there's really only one that matters to us, the big one that Genesis will compete in.
*  Breeder.
*  Breeder.
*  That's her.
*  Three to six.
*  Three to six.
*  It's going to be a long day.
*  I know.
*  Because I have approximately seven hours to marinate in ferrets and try out the whole
*  ferret lifestyle.
*  So we're just walking around kind of getting the scene and interviewing people.
*  Hey, how's it going?
*  Good.
*  How are you doing?
*  Hey, how you doing?
*  And as I start talking to ferret owners.
*  What was it like about a ferret?
*  Was there something that like appealed to you?
*  What becomes clear is that.
*  I feel like, oh, these are kind of my people.
*  Ferret people are their own special breed.
*  It's always good to get together with a group of ferret people.
*  And everybody's so kind.
*  Anyone can own a cat or a dog.
*  She has ferrets on her shoes.
*  She's got so many ferret pins on her hat.
*  But ferret owners take things to a whole different level.
*  I've had ferrets since 97.
*  86 was my first ferret in 1982.
*  And then after that I got more, of course, because there's ferret math, as you can ask
*  any of these guys.
*  You start out with one, you end up with many.
*  I came home with 27 ferrets.
*  When I was only going to come home with three.
*  How many ferrets do you have?
*  Twenty.
*  That's low for me.
*  They're really cute and they're fun to play with.
*  He just came up to me and he was just loving and just really cute.
*  I started playing with musky for 10 minutes and I absolutely fell in love.
*  The love ferret people have for their ferrets.
*  I love my little golden nuggets.
*  It is a special love that can lead to some pretty wild situations.
*  I set up a baby pool.
*  It's like filling a pool with Cool Whip.
*  And the next thing you know we let the ferrets go.
*  In this Cool Whip.
*  Of course some of them just lit.
*  But after a while you've seen them coming up through the Cool Whip and down through
*  the Cool Whip.
*  It was chaos.
*  It was absolute chaos.
*  So are you all judges?
*  Um, yeah.
*  We're board members, past presidents.
*  She's current treasurer and I'm in charge of ship.
*  At one end of the hall, up on a stage, sit two official looking women.
*  Sally Heber and Vicki McKimmy.
*  And today you're judging.
*  Yeah, we're judging.
*  They've been working together in the ferret world since the 1990s.
*  And their official duties have taken them all over the place.
*  Japan, Australia, Germany.
*  Flights paid.
*  Hotels paid.
*  We help folks in Japan set up their organizations.
*  Sally and Vicki helped establish the American Ferret Association's official judging criteria.
*  We wrote the standard in a perspective of what did nature mean it to be.
*  And it gets pretty detailed.
*  So what we're looking for is...
*  They're looking at every little bit from snout to tail.
*  ...structure of the ferret so we're actually feeling all the bones.
*  And then we go into the muscle mass.
*  This is very important.
*  Hundreds of ferrets will pass through the expert hands of Sally and Vicki today.
*  Including Aaron's ferrets, Genesis and Gooseberry.
*  What's the rules on biting?
*  De-cued.
*  Disqualified.
*  If they puncture, draw blood, they're out of here for all three judges.
*  Regardless if the other judges have seen them or not.
*  This is a long day for you.
*  It's a long, focused day.
*  Is it exhausting?
*  Yes, it is.
*  The pool at the hotel closes at 9.
*  I want to be back there to get back in the hot tub.
*  My wife is calling me.
*  Yes.
*  Well, have fun.
*  Judges to the stage.
*  We do this as a blind showing if you've never been here before.
*  So therefore the judges do not know who is bringing their ferrets up to be seen.
*  And then Genesis was up.
*  Everyone's...
*  I have no idea.
*  Yeah, because they're running behind.
*  So I don't even know anymore.
*  I am a little concerned because I have an appointment to get to at 7.30 today.
*  So I don't know what I'm going to do.
*  At what time? 7.30?
*  Yeah.
*  In the middle of all this, Erin tells me that she has decided to buy a car today.
*  I acquired another ferret while I was here.
*  So...
*  Uh-huh.
*  And then I was thinking to myself, where is it going to go?
*  I hadn't thought that far, to be honest with you.
*  And that's a little embarrassing.
*  But I figured it out.
*  And you had not planned this when you left New York?
*  No.
*  It was...
*  I mean, it was in the...
*  It was on the back of my mind.
*  My car is almost old enough to vote.
*  It has a giant rust hole in the side and I still cannot bring myself to buy a new one.
*  What kind of car are you getting?
*  It's a Hyundai Santa Fe Sport 2013.
*  This has already been by far the most ferret-y day of my life.
*  And yet, as the hours crawl by...
*  One, go!
*  It keeps getting exponentially more ferret-y.
*  We watch a tube race...
*  It's going backwards.
*  And then an Elvis contest...
*  Oh, they're weighing.
*  To see who has the fattest ferret.
*  Look at the big belly.
*  You're big for a tube.
*  Look at the big belly.
*  And then we peruse the infinite merch tables.
*  Are you going to buy any merch?
*  So many t-shirts to choose from.
*  I'm definitely going to buy a shirt.
*  I think I'm going to buy the introverted but willing to discuss ferrets.
*  You can go wrong.
*  There's a black shirt that says,
*  Ferret hair? Don't care.
*  It's covered with little white lines that looks like actual ferret hair.
*  There's another shirt that says,
*  Unless you're a ferret, please get away from me.
*  That's the one you should get. Revenge of the ferret.
*  By late afternoon...
*  Listen up. We're looking for breeder hops.
*  Really? We're still looking for...
*  Things are so far behind schedule that the schedule might as well not have existed.
*  And I've reached a point I didn't think was possible.
*  I feel like I'm going ferret blind.
*  Like I can't see ferrets anymore. I've seen so many ferrets.
*  That's a lot.
*  I've maybe had my fill of ferrets.
*  But that doesn't stop Erin from trying to sell me one of her future ferret babies.
*  So you're ready now?
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe? Maybe next season.
*  Yeah, I'm scared to get a ferret.
*  Why?
*  Maybe I'm not up to it.
*  All the energy it takes and all the like...
*  Cause I get like, you know, anxious and overwhelmed and depressed.
*  And then this ferret needs me.
*  Okay, so I get anxious and overwhelmed and depressed too and they help.
*  Remember we take the same pills.
*  Yeah.
*  Just different dosage.
*  And the way that you handle and you look at Genesis,
*  I think you'd be a good ferret dad if you want.
*  But no, if you get one, you know, you got to get three.
*  Three is the magic number.
*  I thought two was kind of the magic number.
*  No, because two is harder because then they'll bond together maybe.
*  And then if one of them dies, the other one gets really sad and it dies shortly thereafter.
*  So if you have three, it's just a better life.
*  Huh.
*  Yeah. I would say three.
*  Three is like having one, but better.
*  Looks like we're ready for the Breeder Jules.
*  It's time.
*  Is it time?
*  Breeder Jules.
*  Finally, it's time for Genesis to be crowned the greatest ferret ever to live on planet Earth.
*  We head to the stage where Sally and Vicki are working their way down the line.
*  Number?
*  Three, 613.
*  Hey, Katie.
*  And then they get to Genesis.
*  Here goes our girl.
*  She's a little squirmy.
*  She's got to giggle.
*  I don't know if that's good or bad.
*  Easy, easy, easy.
*  Don't get all excited.
*  It's all fine and good.
*  There's like a maraca portion of the judging and a rubber duck portion.
*  Don't give them squeaky's.
*  Like she responded well to the duck.
*  Just like silk.
*  I know her fur is gorgeous.
*  As we wait for the scores to be tallied, for the finalists to be called up,
*  Looks like Erin is over there getting all packed up.
*  I see Erin leaving the hall.
*  Yeah, there she goes.
*  She's coming back after she gets her new car, is the plan.
*  This means I am in charge now.
*  We are ready for callbacks for Breeder.
*  501, 503, 506, 507, 507.
*  501, 503, 506, 507.
*  I'm standing clenching my sweaty fists as the announcer calls back all the ferrets that have placed in Genesis's category.
*  Genesis's number is 613.
*  609, 611, and 612.
*  But they never call it.
*  Genesis wins nothing.
*  Yeah, I feel too blasted to talk to anybody.
*  And I actually feel crushed.
*  I got all swept up in the rush of competition, and now my nervous system feels like a dirty old rung-out sponge.
*  By this point, we've been here almost 12 hours.
*  Things are running so late that the guy who rented out the hall is standing in the doorway looking furious with his keys in his hand.
*  The vendors and breeders are all scrambling, packing their merch and breaking down tables.
*  One of the winning ferrets gets her foot stuck in the trophy.
*  And the whole thing is ending in a crescendo of ferret chaos.
*  All right, we gotta lose ferret.
*  Did somebody pick it up?
*  Yes, but someone needs to identify it.
*  And yet, somehow, there is still one last category left to judge.
*  It's called Passport for ferrets with foreign ancestry, which means gooseberry.
*  Our Hungarian ferret will be the last chance to win anything.
*  But Aaron is still gone.
*  It's just me and Goose.
*  And I really want the two of us to get a win.
*  So I open his carrier.
*  I look at him.
*  And he looks at me.
*  Then he pops right out and nestles into my hands like he belongs there.
*  Like he's been custom shaped to fit my grip.
*  How's it going?
*  Good. He's pretty chill. He's interested in my beard.
*  He's definitely going to shoot out of my hands in a second here.
*  Ow!
*  Bit my arm.
*  Vicky beckons us up to her table.
*  She twists and turns gooseberry in her hands.
*  She looks in his mouth and his ears.
*  And he doesn't bite her or claw her.
*  For once, he's actually a good boy.
*  And then very matter of factly, she hands him back to me.
*  Like he's my ferret.
*  He's an addict. We've always meant to do something that fits pretty big.
*  And what if he was?
*  It would be a really good place for a ferret.
*  For two or three ferrets.
*  They could really run around and have their own space.
*  They wouldn't smell up the rest of the house.
*  In eighth place, it's 905.
*  Vicky starts calling out the winners, countdown style.
*  Four oh five.
*  Sixth place is 904.
*  Fifth place is 101.
*  It's happening.
*  Fourth place is 901.
*  Holy crap.
*  Third place is 909.
*  It's you.
*  Can I see 108 and 109?
*  Sam has to show gooseberry again to break it high.
*  To second place goes to 109.
*  And first place, that's where it goes.
*  Second place.
*  In the final competition of the Buckeye Bash, gooseberry, the world's most ferret-y ferret, has won second place.
*  Okay, okay, okay.
*  I gotta get the jigsaw.
*  I pick up my triumphant green ribbon.
*  Would you get second place?
*  And gooseberry and I get our official Buckeye Bash photo.
*  Congratulations guys.
*  Alright. Thank you. Cool.
*  Congratulations. Thank you.
*  We did it buddy. I told you we'd do it. I told you coming into today you were a star and a champion.
*  Is Erin coming back?
*  Just then, Erin texts us a photo of her new car.
*  A brown Hyundai with a giant yellow bow on it.
*  It's big enough to fit her dog, her friend Karen, and all of her ferrets.
*  At least for now.
*  This guy got second place.
*  And we text her back a photo of me with my ribbon holding goose, looking almost terrifyingly happy.
*  Have a great evening.
*  Bye, you too.
*  She says she'll be wrapped up with paperwork for a while and asks if I will take the ferrets back to the hotel.
*  Hey.
*  Which of course, I'd love nothing more.
*  Second place? Yeah, we did it.
*  Holy crap, look at you.
*  When we meet Erin, I tell her everything.
*  So that's all your ribbons. I have my ribbon.
*  Yeah, I was gonna say you're gonna give that one up.
*  And then I reluctantly surrender my ribbon, which I was hoping she would let me keep.
*  Thank you. Thank you for doing that for me, for being there.
*  My pleasure.
*  What is that? He's tired and hungry.
*  We all say goodbye.
*  Alright, goodnight.
*  And when I leave, my ferrets stay behind.
