# How Trump Wiped Out $10 Trillion in Wealth in 3 Days
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=4.16s)]
*  Checked your 401k today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=10.16s)]
*  You know you lost a lot, a lot of money. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=11.44s)]
*  Monday was yet another dark day on Wall Street as global stocks whipsawed over President [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=14.56s)]
*  Trump's universal tariffs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=21.52s)]
*  A bear market briefly became official in the U.S. and tit-for-tat retaliation with China [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=23.52s)]
*  intensified. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  President Trump is doubling down, now threatening even bigger tariffs on imports from China, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=32.24s)]
*  50 percent, if the country does not revoke its retaliatory tariffs on American products [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=37.52s)]
*  sold there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=42.64s)]
*  Now, as trillions of dollars in corporate value evaporates, Trump's support in the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=43.64s)]
*  business world is cracking. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=49.76s)]
*  And even Republican members of Congress are debating whether to take away Trump's power [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=51.76s)]
*  to wage a trade war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=57.76s)]
*  There's no escaping the fact that business leaders are really losing confidence. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=59.28s)]
*  Bill Ackman, a billionaire who helped to fund the Trump campaign, has called for a pause [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=63.36s)]
*  in tariffs, warning of what he calls a self-induced economic nuclear winter. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=68.72s)]
*  This is Wall Street screaming at the White House, if this is help, we don't want your [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=74.56s)]
*  help, please stop now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=78.64s)]
*  Today, Andrew Ross Sorkin with the view from the stock market and Jonathan Swan with the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=80.96s)]
*  view from the White House. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=87.6s)]
*  It's Tuesday, April 8th. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=92.24s)]
*  Andrew, thank you for coming in the studio. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=99.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=102.4s)]
*  What a day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=103.36s)]
*  Another what a day day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Another what a day day. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=105.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=107.12s)]
*  Well, when things go really haywire in the markets, we like to bring you in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=107.6s)]
*  We reserve you for the for the crises. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for the crises. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=116.96s)]
*  And I think we should start by talking about really the scale of the stock market sell [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=119.28s)]
*  offs that we have witnessed over the past few days. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=126.24s)]
*  Just put that into some perspective. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=129.76s)]
*  Well, look, if you just look at how much money has been lost, we're talking about [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  trillions of dollars with a T, but in percentage terms, you can look over just even the last [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  week, we're down 10 percent peak to trough from the sort of heights of where we were [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=143.12s)]
*  near the election to now, you could argue we're over 20 percent off, maybe more, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=149.52s)]
*  depending on how you do the math. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=156.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's just worth pausing on one fifth the value of certain entire stock indexes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=158.16s)]
*  That's just a tremendous amount of wealth. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=166.64s)]
*  Poof. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=170.96s)]
*  It's a tremendous amount of wealth poof in the sort of broader scheme of the universe. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  But to make it feel personal, let's just say you had a portfolio and you were a retiree [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  and 20 percent of your wealth went poof overnight. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=183.28s)]
*  And it went poof overnight because of a manmade crisis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  Most of the crises that I've come in to talk to you about, whether it's in 2008 or it's the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  pandemic or whatever, there's been something that has happened ostensibly beyond one human's control. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=197.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=207.68s)]
*  This is a panic that has been brought on by a particular person with a particular decision [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=208.08s)]
*  around, in this case, tariffs. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=217.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=219.2s)]
*  Donald Trump's decision to impose what are being described as universal tariffs have essentially [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=219.68s)]
*  crashed global stock markets. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=225.84s)]
*  There's no other way to put it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=228.48s)]
*  So explain exactly why Trump tariffs equals the stock price of some of the most [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=230.16s)]
*  admired and financially seemingly well put together companies in the country. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=240.24s)]
*  Well, let's go through a couple of specific stocks and then let's talk about why it's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=246.16s)]
*  impacting virtually every company in America and frankly the world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=251.12s)]
*  So the easiest example is to look at a company like Apple. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  Its stock has dropped, by the way, about 18 percent in the last five days alone. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=261.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=267.44s)]
*  That is about $700 billion of value destruction, $700 billion wiped out. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=267.92s)]
*  And you might say to yourself, why? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=274.96s)]
*  Well, Apple's a company that manufactures a lot of its goods in a combination of places like China, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=277.76s)]
*  increasingly in places like Vietnam and India. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=284.56s)]
*  In fact, Apple moved a lot of its manufacturing out of China to places like Vietnam and India, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=287.2s)]
*  in part because of pressures from the US government over the last several years, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=293.68s)]
*  having a relationship between the US and China. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=297.36s)]
*  And one of the reasons they did that was because there was always a concern [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=300.56s)]
*  that perhaps there would be tariffs in the future or national security issues. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=304.96s)]
*  Mostly aimed at China. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=308.64s)]
*  Mostly aimed at China. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  There was never an expectation that if you were manufacturing your iPhones in India or Vietnam, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=310.96s)]
*  that all of a sudden you were going to have to pay every time you shipped those phones [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=317.52s)]
*  into the United States, something on the order of a 50 percent plus tariff, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=324.4s)]
*  which is what we're talking about here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  That was your Apple phone ringing. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=332.88s)]
*  That was my Apple phone probably built in China ringing, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=335.12s)]
*  which would be tariffed if I bought a new one tomorrow. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=339.44s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, if you're Apple, you are either going to have to do one of two things. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=342.88s)]
*  Either you're going to have to charge the American consumer, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=348.8s)]
*  ostensibly 50 percent more for the phone than you did before, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=353.2s)]
*  or you're going to have to eat some of that cost, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  which is going to ultimately cut into your profit and therefore, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  cut into all sorts of other things you do, which is to say, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=364.88s)]
*  how are you going to think about hiring next year? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=368.32s)]
*  What does your research and development budget look like? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=371.12s)]
*  Are you going to advertise as much as you did last year? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=374.16s)]
*  And by the way, if the price point for the phone is higher, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=377.76s)]
*  are there as many people who are going to buy it? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=380.56s)]
*  And therefore, all of the economics of everything you do just went sideways, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=383.12s)]
*  just went sideways, and all of the interactions that you have with other businesses just went sideways. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=388.56s)]
*  And so the downstream effects, not just at Apple, but everywhere just cascade. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=395.44s)]
*  I just want to restate this because I think it's worth putting a really fine point on how this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=401.92s)]
*  gets back to the stock market. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=406.48s)]
*  Apple products now hit with these tariffs in a country where it makes this phone. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=408.48s)]
*  If they raise the price to make up for that tariff, then consumer demand goes down. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=415.04s)]
*  Therefore, shareholders might think this company is not worth as much. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to start to sell the stock. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=422.24s)]
*  If they eat the cost of it rather than passing it on to the consumer, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=423.68s)]
*  then their corporate profits are hurt. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  Therefore, I might sell the stock because I don't think the company is worth as much as I did [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  before these tariffs. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  And then you're adding to that, Andrew, the reality that the trauma that has just been [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=433.84s)]
*  inflicted on Apple stock is going to filter through the rest of corporate America to all [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=439.44s)]
*  the companies Apple touches or doesn't touch as much as it used to and their profits and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=445.44s)]
*  their shareholders' sense of that company's worth. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm making this up, but I was thinking about this as you were talking about Apple. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=453.2s)]
*  Apple does a lot of advertising with social media companies like Instagram. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  I have to imagine with Meta and therefore that stock might fall. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=461.2s)]
*  And it is falling. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=466.96s)]
*  And why is it falling? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=468.0s)]
*  Not because it does business in China. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=469.12s)]
*  In fact, Meta does no business in China, but Meta is reliant on advertising. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=471.28s)]
*  And there are going to be a lot of companies that are going to likely scale back [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=477.68s)]
*  how much they're going to spend on advertising at places like Meta. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=482.64s)]
*  Meta is also in the business of building data centers. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  All over the country, they've already said they're going to invest billions of dollars [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=491.2s)]
*  to build these data centers for new AI features. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=495.12s)]
*  Well, those data centers just got a lot more expensive. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=499.2s)]
*  So either they're going to have to build less, which means they're going to grow slower, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=502.08s)]
*  or they're going to have to build the same amount, but it's going to cost them a lot more. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=506.24s)]
*  And that's going to also eat into their profits. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=510.96s)]
*  And therefore their stock is down because technically you would say to yourself, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=513.36s)]
*  well, they're worth less now. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=517.52s)]
*  Got it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=519.12s)]
*  So all of this magnified by the scale of the stock market itself helps you understand how [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=519.52s)]
*  Trump's tariffs equal trillions of dollars in lost corporate value over the past few days. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=526.48s)]
*  Across the board. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=532.48s)]
*  And we're just talking about the most obvious examples. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=533.92s)]
*  I'll give you less obvious examples. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=537.28s)]
*  So if you're a McDonald's or you're a Starbucks doing business, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=539.84s)]
*  not just in China, but all over the world, there are now questions, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  demonstrable questions that they're asking themselves about whether consumers are going [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=548.48s)]
*  to buy their goods. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  They're going to come into the store with the same velocity. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=554.72s)]
*  Even the kind of commodity style, low cost product of a McDonald's cheeseburger and a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=557.52s)]
*  Starbucks medium cappuccino. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=563.52s)]
*  Even a McDonald's or Starbucks is starting to see the effects of it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=566.4s)]
*  Not just even the last week, it's actually been something that's been something they've [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=571.04s)]
*  been concerned about now for several months. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=574.48s)]
*  They're worried about tariffs. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=577.28s)]
*  These companies have been worried about what tariffs mean to the relationship that the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=578.64s)]
*  United States has with the rest of the world. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=584.4s)]
*  What does the American dream halo effect that was over all of these American brands in places [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=586.64s)]
*  like China, in places like Europe? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=595.12s)]
*  Well, that polish is coming off because citizenry in these places are saying, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  we're upset with these people. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=602.56s)]
*  We may not want to go to Starbucks. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=603.92s)]
*  We may not want to go to McDonald's. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=606.32s)]
*  We want to support our own local company. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=607.7600000000001s)]
*  In fact, I keep hearing actually that some of the big consumer brands are talking about [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=611.36s)]
*  future advertising plans that are much more local, meaning don't focus on it being an [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=615.84s)]
*  American brand. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=621.2s)]
*  Whatever love people had for the soft power of America and whatever they liked about and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=623.2800000000001s)]
*  thought about our country and our businesses and our industry. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=629.76s)]
*  There are more concerns about them than they used to be. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=635.12s)]
*  Now, may right now be on the margins, but longer term, I think there are bigger questions [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=637.84s)]
*  about whether the toothpaste is now out of the tube, no matter what the tariffs ultimately [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=642.72s)]
*  turn out to be and how do you get that toothpaste back in the tube if you can. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=647.92s)]
*  How many business leaders that you talk to are calling up the president and saying, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=651.36s)]
*  hey, this is not sustainable. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  This is really a problem for us. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  Look at our stock price. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  This is a really, really big deal. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  Or have they accepted that the president is deeply committed to a long term project of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  tariffs, no matter the economic suffering, short term, especially to corporations out [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=674.4000000000001s)]
*  of his long held belief that this is going to improve domestic manufacturing? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=680.08s)]
*  I think I talked to over two dozen CEOs over the weekend and I would tell you that virtually [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=685.84s)]
*  all of them had tried to call the president, Howard Lutnick, Peter Navarro, or somebody [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  else in the administration across the board. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=696.96s)]
*  They have been rushing to try to get in his ear. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=700.8800000000001s)]
*  But I don't think that CEOs are calling him saying, Mr. President, you have made a [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  terrible, terrible error. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=709.12s)]
*  That's what they think. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=710.8800000000001s)]
*  They think it's a terrible, terrible error. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=712.0s)]
*  I don't know of a CEO who does not think it is a terrible, terrible error. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=714.08s)]
*  Some of them like to use the phrase unforced error. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=720.08s)]
*  However, I think that the phone call is a little different. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=723.6s)]
*  The phone call is, Mr. President, let me tell you what's going on with my company right [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=726.64s)]
*  now. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=730.24s)]
*  Let me tell you about all the problems that this is creating. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=730.72s)]
*  Let me tell you about all of the employees I was hoping to hire and be able to put out a [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=733.0400000000001s)]
*  press release and say that you were responsible for it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=737.5200000000001s)]
*  Help me help you. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  Help me help you. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=740.96s)]
*  I think that is the way the CEO community is trying to position themselves with this [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  president because I think if you go straight at him publicly or privately, the phone call [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=748.88s)]
*  ends quickly. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=753.84s)]
*  Well, there are two exceptions to what you just said over the past few days. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=754.64s)]
*  One of them involves a billionaire investor named Bill Ackman who, throughout the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=759.92s)]
*  presidential campaign, vocally supported Donald Trump. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=763.36s)]
*  And he, over the past 48 hours or so, comes out and says what many in his world do not. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=766.4s)]
*  These tariffs are a big mistake. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=771.04s)]
*  But I want to stop you for a moment because he then put out tweets this morning, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=773.8399999999999s)]
*  effectively apologizing for some of his earlier comments about Howard Lutnick, the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=779.52s)]
*  Commerce Secretary. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=784.8s)]
*  I did notice that. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's indicative of what so many senior executives are thinking about, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  which is what can I say publicly, especially if I want to have access privately? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=792.64s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  That billionaires get spooked, but they do by this president. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=798.08s)]
*  The whole idea that if you had a lot of money, you were somehow protected or that you would [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=801.84s)]
*  feel compelled and feel emboldened to stand up so far has not been the case. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=807.5200000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about the second exception, which was Elon Musk. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=816.1600000000001s)]
*  He says over the past few days, and we should establish, not that it needs saying, that [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=820.96s)]
*  his Trump loyal bona fides are pretty much unquestioned at this point. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=826.64s)]
*  He says, I think that we should be living in a world of zero tariffs between the United [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=830.56s)]
*  States and the European Union, specifically. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=836.96s)]
*  It's a pretty subtle but clear way of saying that this Trump universal tariff program, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=841.76s)]
*  this is not good. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=847.52s)]
*  There's no question that Elon Musk differs from the president on tariffs. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=848.72s)]
*  But I think he, unlike so many of the other executives in America, feels like he has a [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  special license to create some daylight on certain types of issues. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=857.76s)]
*  I think in many ways, Elon Musk is just closer to the Scott Bessons of the world who say this is a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=863.12s)]
*  great way to negotiate with other countries to get their tariffs to go to zero. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=868.0s)]
*  I'm glad you brought that up because I think this is an essential question. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=872.72s)]
*  When you talk to business leaders, do they believe that what we are now in the middle of [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=875.76s)]
*  is a long-term reorienting of the American economy around high tariffs, protectionism, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=880.96s)]
*  and a project of reestablishing domestic manufacturing? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=886.24s)]
*  Or are they of the belief that the pain that they're currently experiencing is [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=889.6800000000001s)]
*  going to be a short-term one as the president negotiates tariff deal, tariff deal, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=894.64s)]
*  tariff deal with the EU, with China, with Thailand, et cetera? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=900.48s)]
*  Today, we saw that literally they're negotiating with Japan. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=905.76s)]
*  In this very moment, I would tell you the majority of business leaders is saying, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  you know what? I'm going to wait this out. I'm going to play chicken with the president. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=914.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to see what happens with the stock market. If the stock market continues to go lower, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=917.76s)]
*  it will likely put more pressure on the president and Congress and the Senate [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=922.88s)]
*  to somehow undo these tariffs. Maybe the courts get involved and say that the president doesn't [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=928.0s)]
*  have the powers to enact these tariffs to begin with. If that's the case, why should I be investing [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=934.32s)]
*  in manufacturing in America if there are not going to be these tariffs in six months or even [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=942.0s)]
*  two years or three years or five years from now? Right. What you're really saying is, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=947.7600000000001s)]
*  as all these business leaders stew over their lost stock prices and privately negotiate with [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=953.5200000000001s)]
*  the president, they're not really interested in giving him what he wants and what he would need [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=960.0s)]
*  for these tariffs to do the very thing they're supposed to do, which is to bring more manufacturing [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=966.24s)]
*  back to the US. That's a pretty messy reality of this dynamic right now. You use the word mess. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=970.16s)]
*  In the business community, they call this uncertainty. Uncertainty is the enemy of [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=977.44s)]
*  business. It's the enemy of investment. Nobody invests into an uncertain market, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=982.4s)]
*  into an uncertain situation. You as a CEO need to make a bet. If you think that there are tariffs [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=987.6s)]
*  here and that's a politically popular position, even after a Trump administration, you might bring [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=995.0400000000001s)]
*  manufacturing back to the US solely to avoid the tariffs. If you don't and the pain of moving [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1002.64s)]
*  is high, you may try to play this out and see what happens. What you're describing would seem [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1010.88s)]
*  to be an incentive structure for the president to create certainty. That certainty would seem to be, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1018.24s)]
*  I'm determined to keep these tariffs in place. I did notice today, we're talking on Monday, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1025.36s)]
*  that when there was a brief moment where someone posited that there might be a pause, these might [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1031.76s)]
*  be, they shut it down. They said, no, this is for real. This is for keeps. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  Because from a negotiating position, and the president talks about this in his book, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1043.6799999999998s)]
*  The Art of the Deal, this is what they describe as anchoring. It's called an anchoring technique, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1048.56s)]
*  which is to say that you state your position and you hold your position. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1053.84s)]
*  And the moment you break from that position, it becomes a lot harder. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1059.84s)]
*  And so you're 100% right. The second that they start announcing that they are taking a pause, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1067.6s)]
*  or that they're willing to do a deal at a lesser number, or whatever it is, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1074.7199999999998s)]
*  they've undermined their own case. The business community has a phrase that they've been using [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1079.52s)]
*  all weekend, which is what is the off ramp, which suggests that there is one, and there might not be [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1084.32s)]
*  an off ramp. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1091.1999999999998s)]
*  After the break, White House correspondent Jonathan Swan on how President Trump himself [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1097.6s)]
*  is seeing this moment. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1108.8s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1117.04s)]
*  Jonathan, our colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin, who has been on the phone day in day out with the [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1117.84s)]
*  country's CEOs, just finished explaining how privately they all blame Trump for the crash of [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  the stock market over the past few days. And in their minds, this whole program of universal [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1140.3999999999999s)]
*  tariffs doesn't really make any sense and is not incentivizing them to do the thing that Trump [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1146.56s)]
*  wants them to do, which is invest long term in domestic manufacturing, because they're not [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1153.52s)]
*  certain these tariffs are going to last. And meanwhile, their stock prices are down so much [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1160.0s)]
*  that they don't want to do much of anything. How is the president viewing this growing perception [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  of him as basically the steward of what the business community sees as something of an [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1171.36s)]
*  economic catastrophe? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1177.04s)]
*  Well, it's actually a hard question to answer because as a reporter, all you can go by is what [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1179.76s)]
*  he's saying privately to people. And Trump in these moments of crisis doesn't actually always [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1184.96s)]
*  articulate what he's really thinking. So what he's been saying, when people call him, as happened [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1191.04s)]
*  over the weekend, I've spoken to a few people who spoke to him privately over the weekend, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1197.36s)]
*  is in these conversations, he's boasting. He's saying, everyone's calling me, they're all kissing [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  my ass, they all want to do deals, they're begging me. He's in that kind of a mode. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1206.4799999999998s)]
*  To do tariff deals. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1212.0s)]
*  Yes, because I put out these tariffs, everyone's coming to beg, which is a position he loves to be [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1213.1999999999998s)]
*  in. Now that leads you to a second question, which is, okay, so is the goal then to do a whole series [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1219.36s)]
*  of deals that will then actually maybe end up creating a freer trading market? Well, then, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1226.0s)]
*  you ask that question of people around him and they say, well, no, not really. He might do some [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1232.96s)]
*  deals, but actually, no, he's really quite set on this idea of eliminating trade deficits and [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1237.76s)]
*  reshoring manufacturing and building things here in America. So you have these two things running [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1244.64s)]
*  into each other. One problem that some of his advisors have, I would say most of his advisors [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1252.0s)]
*  have, if they're being honest, is get criticized a lot for, well, your messaging is so all over [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1257.12s)]
*  the place. It's like, yeah, no kidding, because the man in charge- [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1263.44s)]
*  His messaging is all over the place. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1266.88s)]
*  Yeah, from one minute to the other. It's like, he's in deal making mode and then he's in no, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1268.24s)]
*  this is an economic revolution and you need to hang tough. You're getting these competing messages. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1274.08s)]
*  I will say it's not just reporters who've been surprised. It's not just pundits that have been [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1280.48s)]
*  surprised or his donors, but some of his advisors, I think, were still of the mindset that this would [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1287.04s)]
*  be term one Trump. And term one Trump talked a really big game on tariffs, but actually, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1294.8s)]
*  when the market started to wobble, he backed off and he was much- [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1302.0800000000002s)]
*  Right, the stock market operated as a check on him in the first term. You've talked about that in the past. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1306.32s)]
*  Yeah, and it really isn't right now. And I think that's freaked a lot of people out because they [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  had a certain set of assumptions about Donald Trump and those assumptions are now being defied. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1316.96s)]
*  Can you explain why the stock market does not operate any longer as a check against the [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1323.4399999999998s)]
*  president? Because it's very hard to imagine a businessman who prides himself in having [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1329.6s)]
*  achieved the confidence of so many business leaders just shrugging off trillions of dollars [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1334.88s)]
*  being lost in just a handful of days in the stock market because of something he did and [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  only because of something he did. It's like a few different theories. One is he's been talking about [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1349.5200000000002s)]
*  tariffs for 40 years. Right. And in his first term, he had to run for reelection. I remember [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1356.24s)]
*  talking to some of his economic aides in the first term and people on the Hill, and Trump would say [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1361.44s)]
*  to them, don't worry, guys, year five, we'll tackle the debt, but we can't do anything with the debt [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1366.0s)]
*  before year five because he's got to run for reelection, didn't want to do anything to upset [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1371.68s)]
*  things. He's not running for reelection anymore. So there is a theory that, well, he feels somewhat [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1375.6000000000001s)]
*  liberated by that and he can do what he thinks is the right thing to do and move forward and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1381.44s)]
*  deal with the consequences. I think a secondary theory, which is empirically true, is he doesn't [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1386.96s)]
*  have as many advisors around him who are making strong arguments to the contrary. In term one, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  he had Gary Cohn, Steven Mnuchin, really some very anti-tariff figures around him on his economic [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1402.48s)]
*  team. And you don't have the same dynamic here. There's not people in the room arguing staunchly [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1410.72s)]
*  against tariffs full stop as there were in the first term. I think the third one is even before [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1416.56s)]
*  he ran for president, other people always end up picking up the bill for whatever he does. He's [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1424.32s)]
*  never actually had to absorb and bear the consequences of his actions. And I think that's [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1432.24s)]
*  on steroids now. If you just think about it, not only did he get through January 6th, he managed [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1437.84s)]
*  to rebrand January 6th for much of the conservative movement. He got indicted in four jurisdictions. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1444.32s)]
*  He was criminally convicted and then he became the president of the United States again. So [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1451.6799999999998s)]
*  if you think about the sort of dynamic we're all aware of, which is when famous people in business [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1456.48s)]
*  or politics feel like all the naysayers have told them this thing and they were all wrong and I was [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1462.32s)]
*  right. Trump might be the most extreme example we've ever seen of that, of situations where [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1467.6s)]
*  every smarty pants in the world says, you're insane, you're wrong. And Trump in his mind says, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1474.32s)]
*  no, actually this is reality and I'm going to bend you all to my will. And I think we're now [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1480.1599999999999s)]
*  seeing the most extreme experiment of that impulse with the economy and the stock market as the [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1486.1599999999999s)]
*  potential collateral. Well, let's talk about what it might look like in the coming weeks and months [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1493.84s)]
*  for him to keep telling what he sees as all the smarty pants that they're wrong and become deeply [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1499.28s)]
*  entrenched in his commitment to these tariffs. Because we're starting to see some evidence and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1504.72s)]
*  admittedly it's small, but it's pretty meaningful given the track record so far in this presidency [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1512.0s)]
*  of elements of his coalition starting to crack a little bit over tariffs. And it began in the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1517.84s)]
*  business community, we just talked to Andrew Ossorcken about this, with Bill Ackman coming out [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1525.52s)]
*  and saying, these tariffs are a big mistake. As Andrew said, Bill Ackman then kind of ruled it back [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1530.1599999999999s)]
*  and Elon Musk coming out and saying, I don't know about these tariffs, I think we should be living [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1536.8s)]
*  in a world of zero tariffs. That does seem meaningful, right? That those people are saying [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1541.92s)]
*  this is a problem out loud. Yeah, I think what's even more meaningful is in my memory, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1548.0800000000002s)]
*  until the last month or so, there's never been a time in the last decade where Donald Trump [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1556.0s)]
*  has been underwater in terms of public perception of his handling of the economy. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1564.4s)]
*  So one of the reasons why his approval rating is so stubbornly stable is because people have [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1569.44s)]
*  priced everything in with Trump pretty much. Like, oh, I found out there's a new woman who's accused [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1576.0s)]
*  him of something. It's not like that changes their perception of Donald Trump. But the one thing he's [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1581.3600000000001s)]
*  always had to his advantage is he is still seen, has been historically seen by a majority of [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1586.0s)]
*  Americans as a successful businessman and someone who can be trusted to handle the economy. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1592.72s)]
*  That is changing. That is changing in a small way, but it's meaningful. And I think that is [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1599.1200000000001s)]
*  the biggest risk that he faces. I was talking to someone over the weekend about this, and they [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1607.1200000000001s)]
*  made the point to me that if this becomes a full blown economic crisis, we will have had [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1613.6000000000001s)]
*  three major economic crises in the last 20 years. The global financial crisis, COVID, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1621.0400000000002s)]
*  and potentially this. But of the three of them, you almost couldn't conceive of a crisis that is [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1628.0s)]
*  more directly attributable to one person. Right. And so as Andrew just told us. Yeah, the political [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1636.0800000000002s)]
*  risk here is, I think, quite profound because it is the one issue that actually he's been really, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1641.28s)]
*  really strong on. And this could actually damage perceptions of him. And that's saying something. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1647.36s)]
*  The possibility of a business community revolt against this so far remains pretty low. But [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1655.28s)]
*  there's growing evidence of something approaching a mini rebellion of congressional Republicans [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1663.28s)]
*  against these tariffs. And I wonder if you can just talk briefly about that and where you think it [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1668.7199999999998s)]
*  might be headed. It feels connected to that polling you just described about how uneasy [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1672.96s)]
*  many Americans are about these tariffs. I think there's a couple of things going on here. One is, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1676.96s)]
*  privately, you'd be hard pressed to find a single Republican member of Congress who isn't [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1681.44s)]
*  extremely anxious about this. And I've talked to a number of them over the last 72 hours. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1686.16s)]
*  That's a different question from how many are willing to actually step out and publicly defy [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1692.08s)]
*  the president. That's a separate issue from an even more extreme scenario, which is enough [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1696.8s)]
*  Republicans, which would be two thirds of congressional Republicans, to override a [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1704.3999999999999s)]
*  presidential veto and push legislation that would restrain his tariff powers. That seems to me, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1710.0s)]
*  at this point, almost inconceivable. You'd have to. But seven or eight of them have agreed to co-sponsor [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1717.6s)]
*  such legislation, right? I guess you're about to say to me, sure, sure, Michael, you need 60. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1723.04s)]
*  You need 67. I don't see it right now. And then the House, it has to pass the House as well. And [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  Mike Johnson has to decide to bring it up for a vote. A lot of things have to happen. And I just [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1735.68s)]
*  don't have any sense that this is going to be a Congress that will step out and defy this [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1741.92s)]
*  president. Things would have to get, I think, still substantially worse for that to happen. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1747.28s)]
*  It's not impossible, but I think it's very unlikely. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1751.52s)]
*  Well, help me understand the thinking of the Trump administration when it comes to this [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1756.32s)]
*  seemingly entrenched position they're in, that they can inflict a lot of pain on the stock market [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1762.8s)]
*  and on people's 401ks and not have it come full circle in the form of voters calling members of [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1768.4s)]
*  Congress and saying, I don't like this, do something about it and them responding. The only [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1777.44s)]
*  way I've been able to make sense of it so far is in what the Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1783.04s)]
*  said a couple of days ago. I'm not happy with what's going on in the market today. He went on [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1789.3600000000001s)]
*  Tucker Carlson's show, but the top 10% of Americans own 88% of the stock market. The next 40% [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1796.64s)]
*  owns 12% of the stock market. The bottom 50% has debt. They have credit card bills, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1804.24s)]
*  they rent their homes, they have auto loans, and we've got to give them some relief. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1812.88s)]
*  He talked about how in his mind, the consequences of these tariffs so far [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1819.04s)]
*  are really only on the investor class. The argument that Besson seems to be making is that [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1824.08s)]
*  Trump's working class supporters are insulated from the initial pain of these tariffs. Is that [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1830.08s)]
*  the thinking so far? That's the best he can say publicly, but privately, most people on Trump's [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1836.24s)]
*  team understand that this is a very precarious situation and it can spiral out of control. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1843.1999999999998s)]
*  It's not for nothing that different investment banks are now altering their forecasts about [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1849.76s)]
*  recession. They understand that this can spill over into the real economy pretty quickly and [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1856.0s)]
*  pretty profoundly. They're doing their best to contain the damage and to reassure people. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1861.44s)]
*  I mean, you saw Scott Besson today come out with a whole lot of tweets about potential deal with [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1868.3200000000002s)]
*  Japan saying, the president has authorized me to create a new golden age of trade with Japan and [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1873.8400000000001s)]
*  50 countries have come looking for deals. These are the sorts of messages that they're trying to [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1879.3600000000001s)]
*  reassure the markets that there is actually a method to this and a potential off-ramp from [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1885.1200000000001s)]
*  an escalating trade war. But the problem- That's an important phrase you use though, off-ramp. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1892.08s)]
*  That's what Andrew Sorkin said everyone in corporate America is looking for. But if they [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1896.96s)]
*  get that off-ramp, it means that Trump was never serious about the tariffs being a solution to [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1900.16s)]
*  reestablishing domestic manufacturing. Right. I still, for one, having tried to cover this, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1906.8s)]
*  don't have a sense at all that Trump is looking for an off-ramp. So I think it's what a number of [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1913.04s)]
*  his advisors are hoping that he goes for. But again, this is not clear to me at all that that's [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1917.76s)]
*  where he's going to end up. So to add to what Andrew said, the business world wants an off-ramp. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1924.32s)]
*  Now you say many of Trump's advisors, even his economic advisors, wish there were an off-ramp. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1930.3999999999999s)]
*  There just seems to be one problem, which is that Trump himself may not want an off-ramp. He may be [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1935.36s)]
*  deeply committed to this as a long-term economic vision for the country. Yeah. And if you take him [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1939.84s)]
*  at his word, which is that he thinks this is necessary and that the US economy needs this kind [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1944.9599999999998s)]
*  of quote unquote medicine, the patient is very sick and it needs this medicine, and it's going [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1951.36s)]
*  to be rocky a little bit, but at the end of the tunnel is the rainbow. He's not saying any [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  different privately than he's saying publicly. So you have to conclude that it's something that [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1961.28s)]
*  he's serious about. And that business community that you speak of, that Andrew was talking about, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1966.0800000000002s)]
*  I've had innumerable conversations over the last three years with people in the business community [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1972.0s)]
*  and their consultants who sort of glibly and knowingly use cliches like, you've got to take [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1978.0800000000002s)]
*  Trump seriously, not literally. And it's all just garbage. It's like, at this point, what are you [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1985.92s)]
*  even talking about? I understand why on this issue people were talking like that because all the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1991.84s)]
*  evidence you had was what he did in his first term and it was much narrower. But at this point, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=1996.48s)]
*  I think people are waking up to the idea that maybe we also need to take him quite literally [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2002.24s)]
*  with much of what he says. And quite literally on tariffs. So if there's ever a question about [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2008.24s)]
*  Trump, literally about its tariffs. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2016.08s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, thank you very much. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2018.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2019.84s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2047.04s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2055.36s)]
*  We're having direct talks with Iran and they've started. It'll go on Saturday. We have a very big [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2057.92s)]
*  meeting and we'll see what can happen. On Monday, President Trump said that the United States would [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2066.24s)]
*  hold negotiations with Iran beginning this weekend in a last-ditch attempt to stop Iran's [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2071.52s)]
*  nuclear program. The talks are a turnaround for Trump, who pulled out of the last nuclear deal [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2078.48s)]
*  with Iran in 2018. But Iran is moving closer than ever to a workable nuclear weapon, a prospect that [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2085.68s)]
*  neither the United States nor Israel say they can tolerate and might take military action to [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2094.56s)]
*  avoid. And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2101.44s)]
*  And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with or frankly that [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2109.68s)]
*  Israel wants to be involved with if they can avoid it. So we're going to see if we can avoid it. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2115.04s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Shannon Lin and Jessica Chung. It was edited by Liz O. Baylin [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIYWuZ_LzhU&t=2121.28s)]
