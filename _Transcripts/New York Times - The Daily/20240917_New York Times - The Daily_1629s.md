# A Second Assassination Plot and the New Era of Political Violence
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUt93dEr_Ic)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, everything we now know about what appears to be a second attempted assassination of
*  Donald Trump.
*  I spoke with my colleagues about the suspect's background.
*  The Secret Service's struggle to protect Trump and this new era of political violence.
*  It's Tuesday, September 17th.
*  On Monday, law enforcement officials offered a much fuller picture of what they're describing
*  as the attempted assassination of former President Trump in West Palm Beach.
*  The second such attempt on his life in just over two months.
*  According to a criminal complaint, cell phone data showed that the suspect, Ryan Wesley
*  Rouse, had been lurking in the woods near Trump's golf course for roughly 12 hours,
*  starting at around 2 a.m. on Sunday morning.
*  Then, around 1 30 p.m., as Trump began a round of golf, a Secret Service agent who was monitoring
*  the perimeter of the golf course spotted what appeared to be the barrel of a rifle poking
*  out from a line of trees.
*  Moments later, the agent fired in the direction of the rifle.
*  All right, 1 30 this afternoon.
*  Call came out, shots fired.
*  That was called in by the Secret Service.
*  It was then, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Rick Bradshaw, that Rouse, unharmed
*  by the gunfire, fled the scene.
*  Fortunately, we were able to locate a witness that came to us and said, hey, I saw the guy
*  running out of the bushes.
*  He jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tank, which
*  was great.
*  Police in Palm Beach quickly took that license plate information and fed it into the state's
*  highway camera system.
*  And we were able to get a hit on that vehicle on I-95 as it was headed into Martin County.
*  Take two steps to your right!
*  Take two steps to your right!
*  Driver, walk straight back!
*  About 40 minutes later, police in a nearby county pulled Rouse over and ordered him out
*  of the vehicle, a scene that was captured on their body cameras.
*  Back at the golf course, police found what Rouse allegedly left behind as he fled.
*  Now in the bushes where this guy was is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope, two backpacks
*  which were hung on the fence that had a ceramic tile in them, and a GoPro.
*  By Monday morning, federal prosecutors charged Rouse with two gun-related crimes.
*  And suddenly, the world was very focused on Rouse himself.
*  This morning we're starting to get a clearer picture of the suspect in the apparent assassination
*  attempt on former President Donald Trump.
*  It was quickly revealed that Rouse had a lengthy criminal history, including a conviction in
*  2002 over an incident in which he barricaded himself inside a building in North Carolina
*  with an automatic weapon.
*  What the FBI is also aware of are some of his online claims about foreign travel.
*  But perhaps the most unusual piece of his biography was his decision to travel to Ukraine.
*  Rouse claims that he went to Kyiv in 2022.
*  Which is what had brought him to the attention of my colleague, Thomas Givens Neff, who goes
*  by TM.
*  As it happens, TM actually interviewed Rouse by phone last year.
*  A conversation that TM recounted to me on Monday morning.
*  So it was the winter of 23 last year, and I had just finished covering Afghanistan.
*  I was covering the war in Ukraine.
*  And I was working on a story about these wayward volunteers who had kind of flooded into Ukraine
*  at the start of the war.
*  And when you say wayward, what do you mean?
*  Well, I mean, this is kind of the weird puzzle where the West is backing Ukraine, but not
*  sending their own troops.
*  And instead, you just have this flood of people who want to support Ukraine.
*  They want to be Instagram stars.
*  They want to write books.
*  They want to see combat.
*  They want to kill people.
*  And one of these volunteers that showed up in Ukraine was Ryan Rouse.
*  He was a man in his mid-50s.
*  He was a former construction worker.
*  He grew up in Greensboro, North Carolina.
*  He kind of had this gentle southern twang.
*  And his pictures posted online.
*  They were a little ridiculous.
*  His hair unkempt, wearing like American flag paraphernalia.
*  And I mean, he from the get-go struck me as quite a character.
*  And I was put in touch with him through a colleague.
*  And when I spoke to him after, you know, back and forth on WhatsApp and Signal to an extent,
*  he basically said he had this grand plan.
*  He had the spreadsheet to get hundreds of Afghan soldiers who were spread between Iran,
*  Pakistan, and Afghanistan into Ukraine to fight for the government.
*  So within, it seems like, a very short while of you meeting him, he's describing a very
*  ambitious idea he has to not just personally try to help Ukraine, but somehow recruit people
*  who had left Afghanistan to help Ukraine.
*  Yeah, that was the short of it.
*  And he was talking about paying off officials and forging passports.
*  And there was even one thing where he said he was going to arrange a US military transport
*  from Erbil, Iraq, and it would fly to Poland with these Afghans on board, which seemed
*  absolutely ridiculous.
*  But his tone of voice was already in motion.
*  You know, if he was selling me a used car, I mean, I'd be I'd be paying for it, I guess.
*  But having interacted with a lot of these guys, it was pretty clear it was pretty
*  unsustainable.
*  From what you're saying, this is sounding like somewhat of a fanciful plan.
*  But did Routh at all seem on paper qualified to be drawing up such a plan at all?
*  No, I mean, I think that was one of the things that really drew me to interviewing him for
*  the story and then putting him in there is the fact that he was from Greensboro, North
*  Carolina, had spent time in Hawaii, had absolutely no experience, one in this part of the
*  world in the military, and was just a man in his mid 50s with good intentions.
*  Did he give you a sense of why Ukraine mattered to him, why he had gone there and put all
*  this effort and in theory, risk toward a country he doesn't live in?
*  Yeah, I mean, that's tough to answer, because I think I am a little jaded as far as, you
*  know, the motivations behind the people who show up in war zones.
*  He had all the boilerplate responses where everyone should be here fighting, you know,
*  it's ridiculous that other governments haven't sent troops like it's not me, then who, that
*  kind of rhetoric. But it just felt to me that he was kind of there to be a different
*  version of Ryan Routh and he was putting his entire being into it.
*  That's really interesting. Did he at any point, TM, talk to you about American domestic
*  politics, either in relation to America's approach to the war in Ukraine or in general
*  during your conversation?
*  No, he did not.
*  But a couple of days ago, he spoke to one of his Afghan friends and politics came up
*  and he wasn't pro Trump or pro Biden.
*  He was pro immigration.
*  And at this point, I mean, this was four days ago, he was living in the back of his car
*  and said he had no money in his bank account.
*  So it seemed very much that he was at the end of this arc that began after Russia invaded
*  Ukraine.
*  So I think that brings me to the biggest question of all I have for you, which is, by the time
*  you were done talking to him, and now, of course, incorporating this information that you
*  just described of him living out of a car, what was your overall impression of him?
*  Yeah, I mean, my interactions with him were brief, but I think from the first time I got
*  on the phone with him, I was kind of under the impression that this was a guy who wasn't
*  completely there.
*  I mean, he said things that made sense and he composed complete sentences.
*  But yeah, he lived in a reality that I could see, but definitely wasn't a part of.
*  And I think if it was, you know, some guy in a vacuum that I would say this is it was
*  pretty unsettling.
*  But since there were a lot of guys like Mr.
*  Routh, especially in Ukraine at that time, you know, seemed kind of par for the course.
*  That's not to say that there aren't partners in Ukraine that are there for all the right
*  reasons and doing great things.
*  He just was kind of in a different camp.
*  So what were your first thoughts when you realized that this same guy you had been
*  talking to about Ukraine had been arrested for allegedly attempting to assassinate
*  former President Trump?
*  Yeah, I mean, sadly, it kind of checked out.
*  Right at the heart of this is the war in Ukraine in some way, shape or form that the
*  U.S. has sent and other governments have sent money and weapons, but not people and the
*  people that have gone are of varying backgrounds and have varying motives.
*  And in some way, shape or form, like the war always comes home.
*  And that was just an extension of that.
*  It was an extreme extension.
*  And I didn't think it was going to be someone I talked to on the phone or quoted in a story
*  a year ago. But so it goes.
*  Well, Tim, thank you very much.
*  We really appreciate it.
*  Yeah, thanks for having me.
*  On Monday night, the Times reported that Routh had authored a self-published book focused
*  on Ukraine, in which he expressed his hatred for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his
*  disdain for Donald Trump.
*  In the book, Routh described Trump as a threat to American democracy and at one point
*  told his readers, quote, You are free to assassinate Trump.
*  We'll be right back.
*  By Monday, amid the police briefings and the criminal charges, the real question on almost
*  everyone's mind was how could this be happening again and happening again so soon, which
*  inevitably led to questions about the Secret Service, the agency whose 3000 agents are
*  responsible for protecting presidential candidates, an agency that by its own admission failed
*  to do that two months ago in Pennsylvania.
*  On Monday morning, President Biden himself weighed in, saying that in his mind, there
*  was no longer any debate.
*  The Secret Service, quote, needs more help.
*  So I put all of those questions to my colleague, Glenn Thrush, who has been reporting on the
*  Secret Service's troubles over the past few months.
*  Glenn, should we see what happened here?
*  An agent spotting this gun before the suspect could fire a shot, his eventual arrest, as
*  the Secret Service succeeding or as President Biden seemed to have suggested on Monday,
*  should we see all of this as a sign that the Secret Service is still struggling?
*  To do its job?
*  Well, it's both.
*  The individual agents responded swiftly and they had keen eyes.
*  They did their jobs.
*  But the Secret Service writ large seems to have committed some significant errors in
*  terms of securing the perimeter of Trump's golf club.
*  It appears that Ralph camped out for about 12 hours on the perimeter of Trump's golf
*  course, and that reflects a failure by the Secret Service and its local partners in
*  law enforcement to sweep and secure the perimeter.
*  That's 12 hours.
*  We're not talking about somebody who showed up and then jumped into the bushes.
*  This was somebody who could have been detected for a half of a day.
*  So when we think about the shortcomings exposed here on the part of the Secret Service,
*  it's in failing to secure that perimeter, not in, of course, spotting a barrel of a
*  gun along a tree line, which, as you said, seems quite heroic.
*  Michael, that's the duality.
*  On one hand, they're among the best trained, best equipped law enforcement officials in
*  the country. On the other hand, their mission is so amorphous, rapidly changing and
*  difficult that it's oftentimes hard for them to deal with all these emergency threats.
*  Over the past six months, it seems like they have been one step behind, that they
*  continue to be behind the curve when it comes to addressing all of these new problems.
*  Well, let's talk about that and whether or not it seems to be a resource problem,
*  because one thing that we learned in the aftermath of the first attempt on Trump's
*  life during that political rally in Pennsylvania was that Trump and those around him
*  have said that some of their previous requests for more security from the Secret
*  Service were denied.
*  And the thinking was that after that, that they would get more security.
*  So did that ever happen?
*  We've been told that they have gotten enhanced security and it's not just bodies.
*  It's individuals doing on the ground intelligence to determine threats.
*  But here's the thing. All law enforcement folks, from prison guards to local cops, have
*  trouble recruiting and hiring people.
*  And the standards for the Secret Service are the highest in the country, comparable to
*  hiring FBI agents.
*  So you can't just recruit people easily.
*  So there's a manpower shortage to be able to deal with these threats, which are
*  emerging and morphing and evolving into challenges that the Secret Service has never
*  had to confront before.
*  That makes me wonder.
*  And here, of course, we can't get into Donald Trump's head or into the conversations
*  he has with his security detail.
*  But why is he playing, to put this bluntly, so much golf on an open, seeming golf
*  course that would seem to present a unique challenge to this already strained
*  Secret Service detail?
*  Well, you and I both know that this is part of his routine.
*  This is how he blows off steam.
*  This is how he socializes.
*  Sacrificing this would be an immense change, particularly at a period of time where he
*  is under a tremendous amount of stress.
*  And before we forget, he was shot.
*  He was grazed in the ear.
*  And to anyone who's experienced that kind of trauma, it shapes you.
*  It changes you.
*  It creates a ton of stress.
*  Throw this on top of that.
*  Golf happens to be the way that this guy happens to unwind.
*  That said, it's virtually impossible to provide blanket security in that kind of an
*  environment, and it would make it a lot easier on the Secret Service, which is
*  overstretched already, if they didn't have to confront those kind of challenges day
*  after day, weekend after weekend.
*  So I want to understand from you, Glenn, because you've been covering this so
*  closely, how this latest assassination attempt and this duality, this kind of
*  mixed view of whether the Secret Service handled it really well, is likely to fit
*  into the current investigations into the Secret Service.
*  Congress has been looking into what happened at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
*  So far, their conclusions are very unflattering to the Secret Service.
*  And there are all these calls for major reforms top down within that agency.
*  Is what happened in Palm Beach, do you think going to fuel those calls or because
*  of its complex duality nature, going to be treated a little bit differently?
*  Look, I think we're on two tracks here.
*  You have to do something to triage the situation because you're in the middle of
*  the most intense campaign in terms of security in the history of this country.
*  So they've got to throw whatever resources, whether it's bringing in other
*  federal law enforcement officials, coordinating better with the locals, just
*  to deal with the challenges of the current election for the next couple of months.
*  Right?
*  But after that, and this comes from conversations with a lot of people, former
*  and current federal officials, there has to be more accountability.
*  There has to be more precise systems in place.
*  So I think after all is said and done, we are going to see a major top
*  to bottom overhaul of this agency.
*  Well, Glenn, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  What I can tell you is that we have immediate needs right now and we have great
*  support, not only from President Biden.
*  And you saw his public statement today.
*  After I spoke to Glenn, the head of the Secret Service acknowledged the agency's
*  need for greater funding and for more agents during a news conference.
*  Success.
*  We have to have it every day.
*  We cannot have failures.
*  And in order to do that, we're going to have some hard conversations with
*  Congress and we're going to achieve that.
*  But as the debate waged over the conduct of the Secret Service, there was another
*  conversation happening on Monday about something arguably even bigger, which is
*  whether the United States has now officially entered a new era of political
*  violence with Donald Trump at its center.
*  There have been periods of political violence throughout American history.
*  We've had four presidents who were assassinated and another one who was
*  shot and seriously wounded.
*  Peter Baker is the Times chief White House correspondent.
*  But what we're seeing now does stand out.
*  I think we've had two attempts on the life of a former president and presidential
*  candidate within just two months.
*  And that's a lot.
*  Fortunately, in this case, Trump has survived both of them, but it raises
*  questions about our polarization, about the anger in our politics and our culture
*  and about whether political violence is becoming an accepted or if not accepted
*  and expected regular feature of our politics.
*  Right.
*  And when we think about political violence in this moment or the threat of
*  political violence, it's not just that there have been these two attempted
*  assassinations of former president Trump.
*  There are smaller, admittedly, meaningfully smaller versions of political
*  violence happening across the country.
*  You're right.
*  Exactly.
*  Even in like Springfield, Ohio, a small town in the Midwest, where there's been
*  an influx of Haitian migrants.
*  And the former president just said last week that these immigrants are eating
*  people's pet dogs and pet cats.
*  Not true.
*  No evidence of that, but it hasn't stopped him from saying it.
*  And it seems to have provoked some sort of reaction because there have been more
*  than 30 bomb threats and other threats in Springfield just in the last few days
*  alone and people in the Haitian community, of course, also feeling particularly
*  threatened and that again, it comes back to Trump actually.
*  Right.
*  And of course, anger has been the animating force of Trump's time in
*  politics, both the anger he stirs among his supporters against his rivals and the
*  anger he generates among opponents who come to loathe him.
*  Right.
*  In some sense, Trump is the through line in this new era of political violence,
*  but that's a pretty complicated equation to think about.
*  And I want us to explore this for a minute.
*  I mean, this idea that Trump has at times inspired political violence through his
*  rhetoric, we know that dating back to his first campaign and to January 6th.
*  And now on two occasions and quick succession has become the target of
*  political violence.
*  How are we supposed to think about the two sides of that equation?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I think he has elevated the temperature in our society to the point where therefore
*  politics is an existential fight.
*  And it's not just enough to have a debate about what the best immigration policy is.
*  The immigrants who are here are a threat.
*  They must be dealt with in some way or another.
*  And obviously most rational people don't believe that that should mean political
*  violence, but it doesn't take that many irrational people to cause real trouble.
*  And similarly on the other side where he inspires such anger at himself because of
*  the way he is that inspires, again, people who might not be fully rational to
*  potentially at least lash out as well.
*  Of course, Peter Trump is making a very different argument in this moment, which
*  is that these assassination attempts are not the result of a heightened political
*  temperature that he has created in the system, but instead he is pretty explicitly
*  blaming Democrats and the way that they treat him.
*  Right.
*  And look, you know, the language that Democrats are using against him is pretty
*  strong, right?
*  They're not saying that he is wrong about tax policy or foreign policy.
*  They're saying he is an existential threat to the country, that he wants to be
*  a dictator, that America, as we have known it, might not exist any further if
*  he becomes president.
*  Now, when he complains about that, though, he then uses the same kind of language,
*  if not more extreme, about them because he says that, you know, Kamala Harris and
*  Joe Biden are destroying the country.
*  You won't have a country anymore if she's elected, he says.
*  He literally on Fox News, while complaining about Democratic rhetoric, said that
*  Biden and Kamala are the enemy within.
*  Well, if we believe, and he's making the argument that we should, that using such
*  language encourages people to take violence against him, he doesn't seem to
*  have any compunctions about using language like that against them.
*  And in fact, he's used much worse.
*  He has over the years directly encouraged beating up protesters or hecklers at his
*  rallies, shooting unarmed people like looters or immigrants.
*  He has mocked the vicious attack on Speaker Pelosi's husband.
*  I mean, he has gone much further than the language he complains about Democrats
*  using in his own rhetoric.
*  And so I think we're in a moment in our history where we risk normalizing that
*  kind of conversation.
*  Peter, I want to be careful with this question, but it feels upon reflecting on
*  what Glenn Thrush, our colleague, just told us that we're now facing two very
*  serious problems at the same time, and they're very interrelated.
*  We're facing the problem of our Secret Service being stretched very thin and
*  everyone understanding it because there have been two attempts on the life of the
*  same Republican nominee for president.
*  And simultaneously, the political temperature of the country fueled by that
*  candidate is really high.
*  And that combination seems very fraught and very worrisome.
*  It is fraught and is worrisome and you don't know where it can lead.
*  I'm reminded that in the morning of his own assassination, Jack Kennedy reportedly
*  said, if somebody wants to shoot me from a window with a rifle, nobody can stop it.
*  In other words, he seemed very fatalistic about the idea that you could ever truly
*  protect a president.
*  Now we've done a lot since then to make it a lot harder.
*  And there are more things presumably that can be done now as a result of the lessons
*  that will presumably be learned from these two most recent incidents.
*  But it is true that we're in a moment where our polarization is so exacerbated, our
*  public conversation is so toxic, the anger is so thick in the air that you don't
*  know where it's going to lead.
*  And we've never, you know, in decades, we have not lived through the crisis that a
*  political assassination of somebody at that level would cause.
*  It would rip the country apart.
*  Right.
*  It would simply just tear us apart.
*  It would just tear us apart.
*  Well, Peter, I appreciate it.
*  Thank you very much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, a former engineer for the company that operated the Titan submersible, which
*  imploded in the ocean last year and killed everyone on board, testified that he was
*  fired for raising safety concerns within the company.
*  During a hearing, the engineer told Coast Guard investigators that he was fired for
*  refusing to approve a deep-sea investigation.
*  After he had determined that Titan's hull was unsafe.
*  Another former employee, the company's finance director, testified that she quit
*  over safety concerns, in particular over the submersible's design, which had never
*  met industry standards.
