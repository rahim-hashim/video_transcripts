# The American Journalist on Trial in Russia
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbBinAXYDTs)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benhold. This is The Daily.
*  Now to a big setback for Evan Gershkovich. The Wall Street Journal reporter held in Russia
*  on espionage charges for more than a year. American journalist Evan Gershkovich was detained
*  in Russia more than a year ago. The reporter for the Wall Street Journal is accused of
*  spying for the U.S. and could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Gershkovich
*  has been locked up in a high security prison accused of spying for the U.S. government.
*  The Russian authorities did not even provide any evidence of a crime. In fact, they have
*  provided no real justification for holding him. His trial, held in secret, is now underway.
*  Today, my colleague Anton Trojanowski, on the complicated geopolitics behind Gershkovich's
*  detention, and the efforts to get him home.
*  It's Wednesday, July 3rd.
*  Anton, Evan Gershkovich, an American journalist, is now on trial in a Russian court defending
*  himself against allegations of being a spy for the CIA. If convicted, Evan is looking
*  at up to 20 years in prison. You know Evan well. Tell us a little bit about him.
*  So Evan is a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, writing about Russia. He's 32 years
*  old. He grew up in New Jersey. And in addition to having this journalistic curiosity about
*  the world, had this really personal interest in Russia that came in part clearly from his
*  upbringing. Evan's parents are Soviet Jewish emigres to the U.S. They fled the Soviet Union
*  in 1979 and raised Evan in a Russian speaking household, showing him Soviet era cartoons,
*  you know, having the kind of food at the table you would have in the Soviet Union. And through
*  his early adult life, he wanted to be a journalist and a foreign correspondent specifically.
*  He was also actually an assistant in the newsroom of the New York Times. And then he took a
*  risk. He quit that job and moved to Moscow, where he started out in this very entry level
*  role as a reporter for the Moscow Times. So he was a correspondent in Moscow just like
*  you, which presumably is where you guys met. Yeah, exactly. We met actually at a Starbucks
*  in very early 2018 when I had just started my stint in Moscow as a Washington Post bureau
*  chief. And I was hiring a correspondent. He applied. And at that time he was just starting
*  out so he didn't get that job. But when I met him, I saw this experience that we had
*  in common of having been raised in a Soviet immigrant household and a Russian speaking
*  household in the United States. So I really watched him rise as a journalist in the ensuing
*  years and he also became a friend. Having been a foreign correspondent myself, when you're
*  posted to another country, you really kind of bond with the other foreign correspondents,
*  right? And I imagine that this is possibly even more so the case in a place like Russia,
*  which has grown increasingly hostile to its journalists.
*  Yeah, you do. You do. And certainly in these last years before the invasion of Ukraine,
*  as things got more and more hostile in Putin's relationship with the West, as we had obviously
*  the COVID pandemic, which made it really hard to travel. Yeah, that was a time when the
*  relatively few foreign correspondents in Moscow bonded.
*  And in your work out there, did it ever feel risky? I wonder if there was ever a concern
*  that Avin or any of you other foreign correspondents on the ground had about maybe facing arrest
*  or getting into trouble with the authorities. Was he worried about that?
*  So it was a hostile environment in terms of the rhetoric that the West was basically
*  determined to destroy Russia. There was a lot of talk about the media war, as Putin
*  called it, that journalists were seen to be a part of. But at the same time, Western journalists
*  were able to operate in Russia pretty freely. You received journalist visas, you received
*  an official accreditation from the Russian Foreign Ministry. But when Russia invaded
*  it suddenly seemed that all bets were off. One of the things that happened was just after
*  the invasion, Putin signed a law punishing so-called fake news about the war with as
*  much as 15 years in prison. And I remember, didn't they even outlaw the
*  word war at the time? Yes, exactly. One of the things was, of course,
*  the Kremlin was calling it a special military operation, not a war. And it seemed like even
*  that could be grounds for prosecution. So in those first weeks of the war, a lot of
*  journalists, both Russian and foreign correspondents left. So did we at the New York Times. We
*  also temporarily pulled our journalism staff from the country. But then in the ensuing
*  months it started looking like this law was only going to be used against Russian journalists
*  or people publishing in Russia, not foreign correspondents. And so reporters increasingly
*  started going back. We did. Our colleague, Valerie Hopkins, a frequent guest on this
*  show started reporting from Russia again. So did Evan. And so for about a year there,
*  it looked like it was still possible to do reporting safely inside the country. And then
*  came March 29th, 2023. That was the day that Evan disappeared.
*  He was on a reporting trip to the city of Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountain region.
*  According to the Wall Street Journal's reporting on this, the last his colleagues heard from
*  him was when he was headed into a meeting at a steakhouse in that city. And the next
*  day, March 30th, I remember having breakfast, listening to this YouTube morning show. And
*  by Russian journalists that I often listen to. And they said, we have some breaking news
*  coming in. Evan Gershkovich, American journalist, has gone missing. And this was just that horrifying
*  jolt of like, is this the moment that something really awful happens to an American journalist
*  working in Russia? And then within a few hours, it became clear that this really was that
*  awful moment. And that Evan's arrest was not some kind of misunderstanding, but that it
*  had been very much approved and probably ordered by the Kremlin.
*  A couple hours after those initial reports of Evan's disappearance, the FSB, Russia's
*  Domestic Security Service, the successor agency to the KGB, put out a statement saying that
*  Evan Gershkovich, Wall Street Journal reporter, has been detained on suspicion of espionage,
*  on suspicion of collecting information on behalf of the United States about the military-industrial
*  complex of Russia. And just after that, in his regular call with reporters, Dmitry Peskov,
*  the Kremlin spokesman, said Evan had been caught, quote, red-handed. The Kremlin usually
*  publicly takes an arm's length approach to various arrests, even when they pretty clearly
*  have some kind of political motivation. But in this case, to have Putin's spokesman saying
*  publicly immediately, pretty much after the arrest, that was just as clear a signal as
*  could be that this was not any kind of misunderstanding. And I mean, I think we should just say here
*  to be totally clear that there's been absolutely no evidence made public. He, the Wall Street
*  Journal, the US government have all vigorously denied that he was doing anything other than
*  journalism. This was a move that was approved by Putin.
*  And why would Putin do that? Approve the arrest of a journalist, an American journalist himself?
*  What message was he hoping to send here?
*  I mean, I see three main factors at play here. The first is just the context of his big conflict
*  with the West, with the United States, which Putin sees as existential for Russia. And
*  in that conflict, it seems like Putin feels he has to constantly show the West that he
*  is ready to escalate, that he is ready to break taboos, do the unexpected, inflict pain
*  on the West. And so here, arresting an American journalist is very much a way that Putin has
*  found to create new problems for the Biden administration.
*  The second reason is cracking down on journalism, scaring journalists, something that Putin
*  has been very proficient at for more than 20 years. For most of that time, he was a
*  was mainly focusing on cracking down on Russian journalists. And now what we're seeing with
*  Evan's arrest is that Putin is making clear that being a foreign correspondent in Russia
*  is a dangerous business. And then third, and I think most immediately and kind of most
*  relevant for what's happening now is he's taken Evan as a bargaining chip. It's something
*  that we've seen before. Think of Brittany Greiner, the basketball star who was arrested
*  in Moscow in 2022. And the Kremlin eventually negotiated her release in exchange for the
*  U.S. releasing Victor Boot, a convicted arms trafficker.
*  Okay, so for all these reasons, they arrest Evan. And what happens to him at this point?
*  He gets flown to Moscow and put in the Lofortovo prison in the Russian capital. It's a prison
*  that Evan knew very well as a journalist. Lots of high profile people end up there as
*  they had since Soviet times. And so that's where Evan spent the next 15 months.
*  So what does that look like? What is life like for Evan inside this prison?
*  So what's special and awful about this prison is the incredible isolation that inmates face
*  They're typically held in these small cells, roughly 9 by 12 feet. They typically spend
*  23 hours a day in these cells with the light on. The isolation is so extreme that when
*  you get taken through the prison corridor to your interrogation, the wardens make these
*  clicking sounds as they're leading an inmate to make sure that other wardens know that
*  someone is coming and to avoid even the possibility of two inmates running into each other in
*  the hallway. So Evan is almost completely isolated in there.
*  Does he have any contact with the outside world? So he's not allowed visits from friends
*  or family. The one saving grace, if I can put it that way here, has been that he is
*  able to exchange letters with the outside world. The letters have to be in Russian.
*  They have to go through the prison censorship system. But his friends did set up a way for
*  people to write him letters by just sending letters to an email address. Those letters
*  get translated into Russian, printed out and sent to Evan in prison and he's able to respond
*  longhand. Have you been corresponding with him?
*  I have, yeah. It's been a just crazy experience because again, Evan had covered Russian journalists
*  who were arrested and Russian political prisoners held in jail, as had I. We had both written
*  about and interviewed people who were corresponding with journalists or political prisoners in
*  Russian jail. And so it was just such a mind-bendingly awful experience to suddenly have your own
*  friend end up in that situation. So yes, I have been corresponding with him. It's been
*  just incredibly powerful and inspiring to see how Evan's character has stayed strong
*  and maybe most importantly how he has retained his wacky sense of humor. So he's still keeping
*  his spirits up and I know that that means he also wants all of us to keep up our morale.
*  It sounds like from your descriptions that he's not lost hope. And yet I'm sure as a
*  seasoned foreign correspondent in Russia, he knows that his trial is not a real trial.
*  He must be aware of the odds.
*  Yes, he knows that very well that even though we see the trappings of an independent judiciary,
*  the Russian judiciary is nothing of the kind and there is no such thing as due process
*  in Russia as we know it here in the US. More than 99% of Russian criminal cases end in
*  conviction. So his conviction, now that his trial has started, is a foregone conclusion.
*  And really at this point, the main hope that he has of getting out and returning home is
*  completely outside his control, completely outside the Russian judicial system and actually
*  goes all the way to international geopolitics.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Anton, you've said that Evan's conviction is really a foregone conclusion, which means
*  he could be sentenced to decades in prison in Russia. Is there any hope at all of getting
*  him out of Russia?
*  So it's still an open question. He faces 20 years in prison and it does look like the
*  most realistic way for him to get out before then is some kind of prisoner swap between
*  Putin and the United States.
*  So the idea is that the US gives Putin some kind of high profile Russian operative or
*  someone considered a kind of a loyal servant by Putin and he sends Evan back in return.
*  That's right and that's obviously something we've seen several times already with other
*  Americans taken prisoner in Russia in the last few years. Putin has made it clear that
*  he's interested in a prisoner swap.
*  My colleague, a Wall Street Journal correspondent, Evan Gershkovich, has been held in the Forteva
*  prison without a trial for 37 weeks.
*  In fact, our colleague Valerie asked Putin about Evan in his annual press conference
*  last December.
*  What will it take to bring them home?
*  And Putin responded, we want to make a deal, but it should be mutually acceptable to both
*  sides, basically making it clear. He sees Evan as an asset to bargain away, but the
*  problem is that though Putin wants to make some kind of deal, it's not clear who, if
*  anyone, the US has in terms of a Russian convicted of a crime that Putin would want.
*  Right, you had a guy and you mentioned he was traded for Brittany Greiner and now you
*  have no one left that Putin is interested in.
*  Not that we know of, but in February it became clear that Putin sees something more elaborate,
*  more complicated as a potential prisoner swap that would involve Evan.
*  Tucker Carlson came to Moscow in February to interview Putin and asked about Evan and
*  Putin said he was interested in a Russian prisoner named Vadim Krasikov who was in prison
*  in Germany having been convicted of a political assassination in Berlin in 2019.
*  I totally remember that case, actually I was based in Berlin at the time and wrote about
*  it. This guy is basically a Russian assassin, right? And he was caught, if I remember correctly,
*  after this incredibly brazen murder where he shot someone in broad daylight right in
*  the center of Berlin.
*  Exactly, he shot a former Chechen separatist fighter in the Tiergarten Park, you know,
*  in Central Park in 2019. It was a really shocking case of a Russian political assassination
*  in a European capital and it's become clear that this is the guy Putin wants for Evan.
*  And I guess the key thing is that this guy has stayed completely silent. He hasn't told
*  the German authorities anything and Putin wants to reward that kind of loyalty.
*  Yeah, exactly. That is really Putin's MO. He values loyalty above all else and doing
*  a trade that releases a Russian assassin who committed this political murder in the heart
*  of Europe, that would be sending an extremely strong message on behalf of Putin.
*  But this is a German prisoner, not an American prisoner. So what makes Putin think that Germany
*  will oblige, that the US can actually offer this guy up for a trade?
*  Well, Putin's worldview is that the US is in charge. He often refers to Western European
*  countries as vassals or satellites of Washington. So he thinks he can negotiate a deal with
*  the Biden administration to orchestrate some kind of release here.
*  And is he right? What are the chances of this actually happening?
*  Well, it's complicated. As you know, the Germans historically don't like to do this. They don't
*  have a track record of doing prisoner exchanges, even to free their own citizens who have been
*  detained abroad because of the concern that doing so could encourage further hostage taking.
*  Right. It kind of sets a precedent in a way.
*  Yes.
*  So where are these current negotiations concerning Evan at? Do we know anything?
*  So obviously they're happening very much behind the scenes. The Wall Street Journal has reported
*  that when Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, visited President Biden at the White House
*  early this year, that this came up, that at the time he and Biden discussed a potential
*  deal that would involve freeing Vadim Krasikov, the assassin, in exchange for releasing Evan,
*  for releasing Paul Whelan, another American who's held in Russia right now, and potentially
*  for Alexei Navalny, the Russian dissident.
*  But then Navalny died.
*  That's right. He died on February 16th, just a week after that Oval Office meeting between
*  Biden and Scholz. We still don't know the circumstances of that death, but ever since
*  American and Russian officials have continued to say that negotiations are ongoing. In fact,
*  it does appear from the reporting out there about this that Germany is open to helping
*  the US here. But it would be politically difficult in Germany to release an assassin, and it
*  would have been perhaps easier to do that if Navalny had been involved.
*  We know very little about what a potential trade now would look like.
*  Tell us about this trial that has just started. It's clear that this is a sham trial. There's
*  been no evidence presented. But what do you expect that to look like?
*  To zoom out, this is part of this kind of judicial theater that we see in Russia and
*  that we have seen in Russia for many court cases that are politically motivated, where
*  basically the Russian government is trying to kind of give this veneer of legality to
*  the repressions it carries out. In this case, the trial is actually going to be a secret
*  trial closed to the public. And that is in the court's telling because there are state
*  secrets involved here. And that is in fact how espionage trials or treason trials are
*  typically carried out. Again, we can fully expect a conviction. In
*  fact, the judge in this case told local media a few years ago that he had only had three
*  or four acquittals in more than 20 years of service.
*  Oh, great. What a thing to boast about.
*  Exactly. So that gives you a sense of the attitude going in here. The trial could take
*  months. The first hearing was last week, June 26th. The next one has been scheduled
*  for August. And this is all taking place in a courthouse in Yekaterinburg where Evan was
*  arrested. So he's now been moved from that prison where he spent about the first 15 months
*  of his arrest in Moscow. But again, the main most important thing is
*  going to be the negotiations taking place behind the scenes. And I think you can very
*  much expect that if there were to be some kind of agreement that a trial could be sped
*  up because the Russians have also said that they only will do trades when the person is
*  convicted in Russia. So Anton, why even bother with this trial that
*  is so clearly a sham? I mean, they've presented no evidence and Putin himself is going out
*  publicly saying that Evan is pretty much a bargaining chip for him to get a Russian prisoner,
*  a hitman out of jail. Why bother with this trial at all?
*  You got to remember that Putin is always playing to multiple audiences. And here, one of the
*  main audiences is domestic. This trial is being covered in the Russian media on Russian
*  TV. And it's very important for Putin to continue sending the message to Russians inside the
*  country that there are American spies. You can't trust the West. Journalists can't be
*  trusted. That's the kind of message around this trial that the Russian public is seeing
*  on TV. So they're seeing what is described to them as a judicial system at work.
*  Of course, I'm sort of aware, Anton, as we're coming to the end of this conversation, that
*  the backdrop to this trial is the war in Ukraine. And it sort of strikes me that that
*  war is in the third year and Ukraine is struggling and Putin can look quite triumphant at times.
*  People are sort of asking the question of whether he's winning. And I look at this negotiation
*  here and I'm thinking the stakes for Putin are actually pretty low. What does he have
*  to lose in the end? So are we dealing in a way, we the West, are we dealing with a kind
*  of triumphant Kremlin?
*  Well, I think that Putin in many ways sees that he's engaged in this conflict with a
*  weak hand. He's got a small economy, relatively speaking, a conventional military that struggles
*  on the battlefield. So even though Putin has managed to take some momentum in Ukraine,
*  and does see Ukraine as part of that bigger fight he's waging against the West, he's still
*  overall struggling to get his way. And so that's where the negotiations around Devin's freedom
*  come in. Devin has become in this incredibly devastating way a pawn in this geopolitical
*  conflict. And Putin is doing this more and more also. There have been other foreigners
*  arrested in Russia just in recent months. And last year there was also another American
*  journalist, Al-Sukhumashvili, of Radio Free Europe, Radio Liberty, arrested. And she remains
*  behind bars. So Putin is actually continuing to broaden out this conflict that we might
*  think of just as the war in Ukraine and maybe some other isolated instances like Devin's
*  arrest. But again, to Putin this is this kind of all-encompassing conflict where he's
*  constantly looking for ways he can raise the pressure and look for tactical wins against
*  the US.
*  Anton, I want to ask you, as someone who's been covering Russia for many years, who knows
*  the country intimately well, and also as someone who knows Evan, what's going through your
*  head as you're following this trial?
*  The incredible injustice of it all. The fact that Evan really devoted his professional
*  career, so much of his adult life, to covering Russia, understanding Russia on a journalistic
*  level as well as on a personal level. It was just a place that he loved so much, that he
*  was so passionate about. It also makes me think of his parents who fled the Soviet Union,
*  who were looking to escape the repressive system of that time. And now they're seeing
*  their son, Evan, who was born in America, being repressed by essentially that same system.
*  So, this case is not just like this personal drama, and it's not only a geopolitical drama,
*  but it's also kind of a press freedom issue. You know, Moscow in the not so distant past
*  had an absolutely thriving scene of foreign correspondence. There was so much great journalism
*  coming out of Russia these last decades. And yeah, now it's come to this.
*  Anton, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Katrin.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, the anxiety over President Biden's
*  fitness to run for re-election erupted into the open, as a number of Democrats publicly
*  urged him to withdraw from the race. Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas was the first sitting
*  member of Congress to say that Biden's faltering debate performance last week had disqualified
*  him from running again. Others echoed this call.
*  Biden should withdraw from this race. But the path ahead requires a new generation of
*  leadership to take our country forward.
*  Adam Frisch, who's running for Congress in Colorado, said that winning the presidential
*  election would require a younger candidate.
*  The Democrats need a new nominee on the ballot in November. We need to recalibrate and we
*  need to do so quickly.
*  Marianne Williamson, who lost to Biden in the primaries, urged Democrats to choose a
*  new candidate at the Democratic convention in August. The vast majority of Democrats,
*  including party leaders, remain publicly supportive of Biden.
*  And the judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial delayed his sentencing from July to
*  September. He made the decision after the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that gives
*  Trump broad immunity on all official business.
*  Trump, who was found guilty of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal
*  during his 2016 presidential campaign, could face up to four years in prison.
