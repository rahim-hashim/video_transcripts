# The Army of Poets and Students Fighting a Forgotten War
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmesVx34WMc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benhold. This is The Daily.
*  Myanmar is home to one of the deadliest, most intractable civil wars on the planet.
*  But something new and remarkable is happening.
*  An unusual wave of young people from the cities, including students, poets, baristas,
*  have joined the country's rebel militias.
*  This coalition is now making startling gains against Myanmar's military dictatorship.
*  Today, my colleague Anna Beach takes us inside this surprising resistance movement.
*  It's Monday, June 24th.
*  Anna, you've been covering a war that is barely getting any attention in the world.
*  We hear a lot about Gaza and Ukraine, but you've been covering this war in Myanmar.
*  And now, three years in, something is shifting in a really unexpected way.
*  Tell us what's happening.
*  I think when we imagine a civil war in Southeast Asia, we expect, I don't know,
*  guerrillas in combat fatigues fighting in the jungle.
*  And yes, you do have those long-time rebel fighters.
*  But what's happening now is that these veteran soldiers have partnered with a new and exciting force,
*  which is young people from the cities who have joined together with these old guys,
*  and they've decided to fight the good fight for an ideal called democracy.
*  And remarkably, three years after the civil war began, they're starting to win.
*  Wow. And just for context, remind us how this war started. Where are we in this story?
*  So for about 50 years, Myanmar was stuck in this kind of awful, preserved in amber military dictatorship.
*  And then about a decade ago, the Myanmar military leaders, they started to peacefully transfer some of the power
*  to a democratically elected leadership.
*  And that civilian leadership was led by, I think, the one Burmese person that people might know, Da Onsang Su Chi.
*  She's a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and she's very eloquent in English.
*  And she was this kind of paragon of democracy and nonviolent resistance to this big, bad military dictatorship.
*  Yeah, I remember actually how she was celebrated.
*  There were sort of pop art posters of her for sale, and she gave lectures in Oxford.
*  And of course, even Obama visited her.
*  Exactly. She was up there with the Dalai Lama, with Nelson Mandela.
*  And so, yes, you're right. President Obama visited not once, but twice, I mean, to this little country in Southeast Asia that people had barely heard of.
*  But then the Myanmar military unleashed an ethnic cleansing campaign against the ethnic minority Rohingya Muslims.
*  And Onsang Su Chi, who was constantly under pressure from the military,
*  goes to an international court and defends the military against charges of genocide.
*  And it's at that moment where all these world leaders who'd wanted to associate themselves with the great things that were happening in Myanmar were a little bit embarrassed.
*  And foreign governments just sort of backed away.
*  Right. So Onsang Su Chi, who represented, in a way, the hope of democracy to many in the West, sides with the military on persecuting the Rohingya.
*  And it's a real embarrassment for all the people that endorsed and supported her.
*  Yeah. And I think that's the context in which this coup happens, right?
*  So February 2021, the military arrests the civilian leadership of the country, puts Don Onsang Su Chi in jail.
*  And the people who suddenly lose so much from the resumption of military rule go out on the streets.
*  And there are millions of people on the streets who are peacefully protesting.
*  And the military does what it has done over and over and over again with pro-democracy movements in Myanmar, which is to shoot people on the streets.
*  And that catalyzes a lot of young people, doctors and lawyers and engineers and airplane mechanics and poets and civil servants,
*  to do something unprecedented, which is to escape from the cities and make their way to the borderlands of Myanmar,
*  where a bunch of ethnic militias have for generations been fighting the military junta.
*  And they join these ethnic militias and form a unified armed resistance.
*  So students and other young people from the cities join this armed resistance against a real army with a brutal history.
*  It doesn't really sound like they stand a chance.
*  It doesn't. And I think those of us who've watched Myanmar for a while sort of expected it to be a David and Goliath story in which Goliath wins.
*  But a few months ago, I started hearing something that surprised me,
*  which is that a coalition of these resistance groups, these militias, had launched an offensive.
*  And within a few months, you had dozens of towns that changed from junta control to rebel control.
*  You had hundreds of Myanmar army outposts that changed hands to resistance control.
*  And so by the time the kind of dust settled, you had a situation in which more than half of the territory of Myanmar is now in resistance hands.
*  It is an unprecedented rate of success for a ragtag group, some of whom two years ago had never even picked up a gun.
*  I mean, that's incredible. So they basically won back more than half of the territory.
*  And they did so in just a few months. How is that possible? I mean, what are these rebels doing?
*  Yeah, that's the question that I really want the answer to as well.
*  And that's the main reason that I worked with our security team and my editors to be able to organize a trip back to Myanmar.
*  We're traveling on a road that is off in mind. So the driver is trying to be as careful as possible.
*  To actually get there, we went in a pretty convoluted route because the main roads in the area where we were,
*  which is called Khorani states, are mostly within sites of the Myanmar military.
*  And so we were worried about being targets. And so we had to take back jungle roads.
*  And all of a sudden I see in front of me a very brown flat river and I'm looking at it and I see absolutely no bridge.
*  And we're in this pickup truck. And I think, how in the world are we going to cross this river?
*  So here is a boat. And here is our car.
*  And I see in front of me these sort of long boats with engines on the back.
*  And in between these boats, they have kind of pieces of wood, like planks.
*  And apparently our car is going to go on there, which seems like a mathematical impossibility, but we'll see how it goes.
*  And we go over these two planks. And suddenly we have landed on top and we're balanced in between the two boats.
*  And this is our car ferry.
*  A car ferry, Khorani style.
*  This is the kind of ingenuity that happens in times of war.
*  So we're back on these jungle roads and our destination is a place where a rebel group called the KNDF, the Khorani Nationalities Defense Force,
*  is setting up a functional government in a place that until really recently had been the site of incredibly intense fighting.
*  And after hour after hour of going either through jungles or passing these empty villages,
*  suddenly we started seeing people and we started seeing livestock and we started seeing cars.
*  And we pull up in sort of like a parking lot and a guy comes up to me and he uses the former name from Myanmar, which is Burma.
*  And he says, welcome to Free Burma.
*  Wow. So you are now in rebel held territory. And what does Free Burma look like?
*  Free Burma is this weird combination of young students who really want to engage in deep conversations about Marxism and about democracy.
*  Except you're in the middle of the jungle and you hear mortars every now and then. And they've had to build everything themselves.
*  They've set up refugee camps for displaced people, a whole functioning government administration in the jungle hills of the poorest state in Myanmar.
*  And the amazing thing is they've built all of this without a functioning power grid.
*  There's no running water, there are no phone lines and there's no normal Internet.
*  And so photographer Adam Ferguson and I traveled around and we went to wedding parties and we met with young girls who were singing resistance songs.
*  I don't speak Burmese, but I'm listening to these songs and the melody is sort of transporting me.
*  And then as I was listening to the lyrics, it was Burmese, Burmese, Burmese. And all of a sudden I hear the words democracy.
*  I heard it in songs and I heard it in basic training by these recruits to the KNDF.
*  And I asked around and it turns out that the phrase democracy doesn't really have a translation in Burmese.
*  This is something that people were laying their lives for, but they were also singing it and saying it in English.
*  And it kind of underscored to me how powerful this ideology was for them.
*  And so I wanted to go and embed with this force and see what they were doing and understand the motivations of some of these people who had joined this rebel force.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hannah, you said you wanted to embed with these rebel forces. Where did you end up going?
*  So for all of Karani State, there's essentially one hospital to which all casualties are taken.
*  And to get there, you travel down a jungle path and you bump, bump, bump, bump in.
*  There are buildings. Some of them are made of brick, but mostly they're made of bricks.
*  This is a secret hospital in the jungle, somewhere in Karani State.
*  And sort of out of nothing, out of the forest, they've built an emergency room over there.
*  Here's an operating theater.
*  And there is a functional hospital that has been built by young doctors and nurses.
*  And medics from the cities who all came with a common purpose, which was to join the resistance movement.
*  And one of the people who made the biggest impression on me was a young woman named Lynn Nizaw.
*  And she she worked as a medic treating wounded soldiers and victims of landmines.
*  Everybody know Miss Lee?
*  She's been part of the resistance in Karani since the very beginning.
*  And she was really striking.
*  We were in the canteen, which was this shack with a dirt floor.
*  And she was wearing these pink pajamas and fluffy slippers.
*  She has a very big social media presence.
*  Oh no, thank you.
*  Yeah, she does.
*  Not at night.
*  And she was a very nice person.
*  And Lynn was from a big city in Myanmar.
*  How did she decide to join the resistance movement?
*  And what propelled you to do that?
*  You know, like I'm just 25 years old youth.
*  She describes herself as just a normal kid.
*  Makeup, K-pop.
*  She sold cosmetics online.
*  She went to med school.
*  On February 29, I joined the protest.
*  When the coup happens, she joins the protest movement like many young people.
*  They started shooting and started killing the people, you know.
*  But when the crackdowns happened, most of her friends, she says, just went home and kept their heads up.
*  So they told me not to do so.
*  Just go back to the university and just finish your degree.
*  And there was something in Lynn that was not able to just go back to her old life.
*  So I choose my way, you choose your way.
*  And so she made this decision to run away and became part of this resistance movement.
*  And what was that transition like?
*  I mean, that's quite a big thing to go to the jungle and completely change your life.
*  I think it was really, really hard.
*  I mean, it is an intense experience for a comfortable city girl to end up in the middle of jungle warfare.
*  And she has been working.
*  She actually doesn't have her metal plate.
*  She's been working for a long time.
*  And she has been working.
*  She actually doesn't have her medical degree because she left before she was able to get it.
*  But every day she is working triage and she is wrapping bullet wounds and getting pieces of shrapnel out of wounded soldiers.
*  She has a saw that she uses for amputations for the victims of landmines.
*  A saw.
*  A saw, yes.
*  Everybody has their own saw.
*  And she is getting kind of a medical education that you would never get in the theoretical world of a medical university.
*  She is trained to plunge her hands into the chest cavities of wounded soldiers to extract pieces of shrapnel.
*  And what she has is a commitment to this idea of democracy that I think is extraordinarily powerful.
*  And she is literally laying down her life for that cause.
*  And Lynn is just one member of hundreds of groups with tens of thousands of people in them in this resistance,
*  which at this moment of time seem to really be turning the tide against the military.
*  It's so clear that these rebels are fighting for something they really believe in.
*  But how is this coalition, how are these groups like the KNDF you spent time with, actually winning territory back from a professional military?
*  Yeah, you're right.
*  The Myanmar military is very well equipped.
*  It has fighter jets.
*  It has big, bad war-making machines.
*  But one of the things that the rebels have is kind of a game changer and an equalizer in modern warfare.
*  And that's a cheap homemade drone.
*  You mean like a very simple drone, the kind that I bought from my daughter at Best Buy?
*  Yeah.
*  So if you take that drone that you got for your daughter at Best Buy and you hand it to a Kurenne rebel soldier,
*  and they go on the Internet and they start communicating with somebody in Ukraine,
*  they take that very simple drone and they start adding bits and pieces to it.
*  And they change something that is used for photography and they turn it into a machine that can drop bombs on the enemy front lines.
*  Wow.
*  So they're actually communicating with other pro-democracy fighters, if you will, in Ukraine and other places about how to do this.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was really remarkable because when I went to the drone base of the KNDF, they were using laser cutters,
*  they were using 3D printers, and they were creating kind of a modern fleet of drones that has the potential to fight against something like a fighter jet.
*  And that really is a game changer.
*  It's interesting.
*  So these rebel drones are clearly proving to be a real headache for the military.
*  Is that the main reason or is there anything else that explains the rebel success?
*  I think the main reason is this really unlikely alliance that has formed between the kids from the cities who have come to the jungles and this array of ethnic militias.
*  Some of these ethnic militias, in a complicated way, don't like each other.
*  And so not only are they fighting the junta, but they're also fighting themselves.
*  And what has changed for the first time since the coup is that these ethnic militias that had these kind of internecine problems have decided to unify for a common goal,
*  which is to fight the junta, and they're beginning to train and help the young people who are coming from the cities.
*  And that's really something that's never happened before.
*  Most of these young people from the cities may have played video games.
*  That was their experience of war beforehand.
*  And then they're coming into the jungle and they don't know how to fight.
*  I mean, they shouldn't know how to fight.
*  But they were given training and weapons and kind of military know-how, how to throw a grenade, how to protect yourself, basic first aid.
*  All of these things were being taught to them.
*  And these city kids have been fighting and dying alongside members of these ethnic militias.
*  And I think this trust that has developed between them has really changed the tenor of the war.
*  So, you know, given that they're gaining territory, given that this alliance for the first time seems to be holding, is there a chance that they actually win?
*  That's a very good question.
*  As difficult as what has happened has been for the resistance, I think it's the easy part.
*  Capturing remote areas is a lot easier than moving into the heartland of the country where the big cities are.
*  And that's going to be a really difficult thing for the resistance to be able to push into and claim.
*  So what lies ahead is the really tough part?
*  Oh, yes.
*  Let's say somehow the resistance is able to push in and put the junta on its back heels in the heartland and kick them out of some big cities.
*  At a certain point, I think members of their alliance are going to realize that they have fundamentally different goals.
*  Some of the ethnic militias want to become independent of a country called Myanmar.
*  Some of them want to control the gains of an illicit economy.
*  Myanmar is one of the biggest producers of methamphetamine, of fentanyl, of opium.
*  And then there are also some people who really want democracy.
*  And so it's very hard to imagine, even if they succeed militarily, for these groups to be able to agree on what they envision Myanmar to look like.
*  So does that mean the idea of some future united democracy is not actually realistic?
*  Across these different groups, everybody agrees the idea of federal democracy is a good thing.
*  I don't know when it comes down to actually forming a new government, should the resistance be able to do so,
*  whether the temptation of power will prove to be a more potent force than this gauzy idea of federal democracy.
*  And I think the reality right now, and even should the resistance win, is a Myanmar that is fractured and splintered.
*  So what does that mean for the young people fighting in the jungle?
*  Are they talking about this? Are they conscious of the risks of their country being fractured and splintered?
*  And are they prepared for such an outcome?
*  It's very easy for political theorists to talk about, is this a fractured state or is this a splintered state or is this a functioning democracy?
*  But I think for the people who are actually on the ground, they are fighting for very specific things,
*  which is a resumption of their lives as they were before the coup.
*  And that was a life in which things were slowly getting better and they had certain freedoms and they were able to vote.
*  And they were able to participate in a, yes, flawed democracy, but a democracy nonetheless.
*  And that is what they're fighting for.
*  And revolutions fail and they fail and they fail until they succeed.
*  And I think for the young people who are in Myanmar, they are willing to give their lives for what maybe to me seems a slim chance.
*  But for them, it's what keeps them going day after day in the jungles to fight for a better future for young people and for all the people in Myanmar.
*  Hannah, thank you.
*  Thank you, Catherine.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Sunday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the United States for the second time in a week.
*  Netanyahu accused the Biden administration of withholding weapons for the war in Gaza.
*  His comments came as Israel's Minister of Defense arrived in Washington for meetings with senior U.S. officials.
*  Tensions over Israel's conduct during its war in Gaza have been rising between Netanyahu and Biden in recent weeks.
*  A day before Netanyahu's latest complaints, Israeli soldiers tied a wounded Palestinian to the top of a military vehicle in the West Bank.
*  The scene was captured on video and quickly went viral, causing outrage.
*  The Israeli military said the act violated military procedure and that there would be an investigation.
