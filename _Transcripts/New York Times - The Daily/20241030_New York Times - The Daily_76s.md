**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOnYSw5jXhE)
*  Speaking of Election Day, there have been some really worrying incidents involving ballots over the past couple of days.
*  But three ballot boxes in three states were lit on fire.
*  How much should we be worried about that?
*  Do you think?
*  I mean, one thing that struck me throughout this whole race is how much concerns of violence have been present, particularly among voters.
*  It's more than anxiety.
*  It's fear. It's menace.
*  I think it is definitely out there and I think people are worried about it.
*  I don't see a universe for the result as believed.
*  Oh.
*  Trusted.
*  Like, what is that universe?

*  I would love for a universe where the results are believed.
*  I believe that is a bad thing for our future and a worrying thing for Trump.
*  You're throwing us over the cliff.
*  But I say it is my expectation that the result is not believed.
*  Does that mean we have the conditions for some of the most scary stuff we've seen?
*  I'm not saying that.
*  But I think we are now working from a baseline of distrust.
