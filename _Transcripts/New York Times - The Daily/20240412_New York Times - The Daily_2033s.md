# How One Family Lost $900,000 in a Timeshare Scam
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3biituRAiVg)
*  Hello, James?
*  Hello?
*  Hey, how's it going?
*  Yeah, I'm not having much luck.
*  So the problem is funding.
*  And all of my money is in Mexico.
*  All of it.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benholt.
*  This is The Daily.
*  A massive scam targeting elderly Americans who own timeshare properties has resulted
*  in hundreds of millions of dollars sent to Mexico.
*  Once you move forward and make your payment, if anything were to happen, he will directly
*  pay you the full amount of what you're entitled to, including the gains.
*  He will pay you the full amount.
*  You've got all my money.
*  It's been spent.
*  I sold a freaking house.
*  Listen to this.
*  I sold a house that I grew up in so that I could come up with funds to send to Mexico.
*  I don't even have anything from the sale.
*  Nothing.
*  My colleague Maria Abia Bip, on one victim who lost everything, and the people on the
*  other side of the phone.
*  That's it.
*  That's it.
*  You know what?
*  That's what has been said every freaking time.
*  Every time.
*  Just pay this.
*  That releases the funds.
*  That's why we won't allow it to happen again.
*  This is the last time, James.
*  It's Friday, April 12th.
*  Maria, you've been looking into the scam that's targeting Americans.
*  Where did your investigation start?
*  Several weeks ago, I received a phone call from a lawyer based in St. Petersburg, Florida,
*  who had been contacted by a family who was very concerned that the father, this man named
*  James, was in the middle of being scammed.
*  He'd sent hundreds of thousand dollars to Mexico.
*  He was considering sending another $157,000 when his daughter decided to call up this
*  law firm and try to get her father to stop sending money to Mexico.
*  I called him a few weeks ago as I was trying to understand what was going on.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, James.
*  How are you?
*  Good.
*  Thank you.
*  Good.
*  James may be withheld for privacy concerns because he's quite embarrassed about the story
*  that I'm about to tell you.
*  You're retired now, but what were you doing for work?
*  If your wife was working, what was her job?
*  I was with the highway patrol.
*  James is a retired state trooper from California, and his wife, Nikki, is a former school nurse.
*  She was born in 51, so 71-ish.
*  Okay.
*  James is reminded to be 72.
*  They're both in their early 70s, and they own this timeshare that is in Lake Tahoe,
*  California.
*  They bought it in the 1990s for about $8,000.
*  For someone who did not grow up vacationing in a timeshare, remind me how exactly timeshares
*  work.
*  Timeshares are essentially vacation properties, and they tend to be beach resorts.
*  People can buy into this property.
*  The ownership is a shared ownership.
*  This gives you the right to use the timeshare for one to two weeks out of every year.
*  James and Nikki use their timeshare every other year with their daughters, but as they
*  hit retirement age and their daughters are growing up and starting their own families,
*  they're just not really using it that much anymore.
*  Timeshares require the owners to pay off yearly maintenance fees, and so they're starting
*  to think about maybe letting go of their timeshare and selling it.
*  Then one day in late 2022, James gets a phone call from a company that is purporting to
*  be based out of Atlanta, Georgia called Worry Free Vacations.
*  Worry Free Vacations.
*  Yeah.
*  Sonsenticing.
*  Yeah.
*  They start off with a simple question, which is, do you want to buy a timeshare?
*  James says, I already have a timeshare.
*  Then they say, great.
*  What about selling the timeshare?
*  Do you want to sell?
*  There's this Mexican businessman, and he's interested in your timeshare, and he's willing
*  to buy it for about $20,000.
*  And James jumps at the opportunity.
*  And did he do anything to try and verify that this was real?
*  Yeah.
*  So remember, James is former law enforcement, and he feels very confident in his abilities
*  to kind of sniff out untrustworthy people.
*  So he goes online, and he Googles this Mexican businessman and sees that, yeah, he is a real
*  person.
*  He's a very well respected individual in Mexico, very well off.
*  And this makes James feel at ease that he's selling to a legitimate person, that Worry
*  Free Vacations are who they claim to be, and that he's going to double his money overnight,
*  essentially.
*  And what happens next?
*  Well, a couple of weeks after he makes the agreement with the buyer, he's told that he
*  needs to send a couple of thousand dollars to facilitate the purchase.
*  What does that mean, facilitate?
*  I can't remember specifically what it was supposed to be, cross-border registration.
*  So he's being told that there are these fees that are paid directly to the Mexican government.
*  Or SPID, or some other fee that was Mexican government required or not.
*  A lot of these fees are the same types of fees that you would pay in the United States
*  for a real estate transaction.
*  So he begins wiring money to an account in Mexico.
*  After that, but a few days later, we get a notification, well, everything went well,
*  except that we have to pay an additional fee.
*  Every time that he sends one fee, he's being told that he's got to send another fee right afterwards.
*  Does he get suspicious at any point?
*  His wife is suspicious.
*  After the first couple of payments, she starts saying, this does not feel right.
*  But James is the former law enforcement officer, right?
*  And he's the one that basically handles the family finances.
*  And he's confident that all of this is going to work out because he's being told that the
*  buyer of the timeshare will reimburse James for all of these fees once the sale goes through.
*  Michael from the Worry Free Vacations was constantly reassuring the monies in that account,
*  check with the commercial escrow account.
*  It's there.
*  It's just these fees have to be paid and you're being reimbursed for all of this.
*  They're sending James documents that show all of the reimbursements that he's owed and
*  how much money he's going to get.
*  And this just makes him feel like, you know, all of this is kosher.
*  We have this commercial escrow company that was involved out of New York.
*  So there was an air of legitimacy that I was comfortable with.
*  You know, maybe, okay, these guys just need one more fee and everything is going to finally
*  be cleared.
*  But about a year in, James starts to get suspicious.
*  He begins asking questions because he wants his money.
*  And every time I asked, hey, is there a way I can get a partial release of these funds,
*  there was always no, these funds have to be paid from your account before they're released.
*  But Worry Free Vacations, they pivot.
*  And they tell him that, listen, you know, there are all these complications.
*  It's going to be really hard to get your money out from this transaction.
*  Instead, we've got this other investment opportunity in Mexico.
*  And that is going to make you a huge return.
*  And more money than you had thought that you were going to make, much more than the $20,000.
*  I'm supposed to have like 54 million pesos in a Mexican bank account.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So this is now no longer just about his timeshare.
*  They are now partners in a real estate investment.
*  Right.
*  And there's this whole new round of fees and fines associated with that.
*  So how many payments would you say?
*  Oh, geez.
*  Quite a few.
*  A couple dozen at least.
*  Maybe more.
*  When was your last payment?
*  It would have been 17 January.
*  And what was that for?
*  That's a good question.
*  And all along, he believed it was necessary to pay these costs just to get the money that
*  he's owed.
*  You know, the amount of money that I've sent to Mexico is just freaking exorbitant.
*  And I mean, it is approaching $900,000 or more.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  At this point, he sent about $900,000 to Mexico over about a year and a half.
*  Nearly a million dollars.
*  That was almost all the money that he and his wife had saved for their retirement.
*  Wow.
*  It also included money from the sale of James's childhood home and money that he had borrowed
*  from his daughter and son-in-law, about $150,000 from them.
*  It's awful.
*  So they were completely cleaned out by these guys.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is when his daughter asks a law firm to look into this, which is the point in the
*  story when I meet James.
*  And when we start talking, it was clear to me that he just did not know what to think
*  even after losing this much money.
*  So this started in 2022.
*  When did it end?
*  We're still in it.
*  Oh, jeez.
*  And he's still talking to the scammers.
*  As a matter of fact, presently, there was a request for $157,000 in change to clear
*  up this whole thing.
*  It would clear the entire issue out.
*  And James is even considering putting a second mortgage on his house to send that money that
*  he'd been promised would finally clear all this up.
*  One final payment of $157,000.
*  It really sounds like he still wanted to believe that this was somehow legit.
*  Yeah.
*  It was pretty clear to me that he was being scammed, but I didn't definitively know what
*  was going on.
*  So I asked him if he could start recording his phone calls with the scammers.
*  Would you be so kind as to do me a favor?
*  Yes.
*  Would you be willing to give them a call and record them?
*  I'll let you in on a little secret.
*  I've been recording them.
*  And it turns out he already had been.
*  Were you free for vacation?
*  So he shared the recordings of these calls that he'd had with these scammers over the
*  last year or so.
*  And it was just remarkable.
*  It gave me huge insight into how the scam worked and the way that it sounded over the
*  phone.
*  Is Michael in?
*  I think he's trying to call me.
*  I couldn't get through to pick up.
*  Yes, I believe he did try to call you, sir.
*  Give me a second.
*  I think he's only going to be in for a couple of minutes.
*  One second.
*  There are two main takeaways for me listening to these calls.
*  Good afternoon.
*  Michael McCarthy.
*  Michael, I missed your call.
*  I was trying to pick up.
*  Yeah, don't worry.
*  Yeah, I figured something was wrong with your phone.
*  Everything okay?
*  The first is that these scammers had really gotten to know James so well.
*  And they really made James believe that Worry Free was a company that was working for him.
*  That's why we need to hurry up and get this money over to you because, hey, I'm losing
*  my mind too.
*  I'm not even here to convince you, James.
*  I'm not, you know, I'm your broker.
*  One of the things they continuously say is, trust me.
*  Look, I'm doing everything I can in my power and will on my end.
*  So James, just look, like I told you from the get go, I'm going to resolve this and
*  we are doing it.
*  I just need you to, you know, focus on the goal.
*  They would refocus the conversation on what James needed to do to get his money back.
*  Look, if you make your payment as a security deposit, right away they will release the
*  funds to you.
*  And the other thing...
*  Hello?
*  I've been having so much trouble trying to reach you and I have not been successful.
*  ...is that the scammers had created this elaborate cast of characters.
*  Why don't you answer my calls?
*  And some of them are really aggressive.
*  James shared a recording of this one man who claimed to be an agent for the Mexican government.
*  And he basically started yelling at James.
*  I don't care if your wife is at the hospital.
*  To be honest with you, I don't give a damn.
*  But you know what I do give a damn?
*  It's your money and my name is really not over it.
*  Do you understand?
*  Yes.
*  And he even threatened James.
*  If James didn't pay off these fines, then he would lose all the money that he'd sent
*  to Mexico already.
*  You could get the best lawyer you want.
*  You could get whoever you want.
*  And this is not a threat.
*  This is facts.
*  But anyway, who am I to convince you?
*  Right?
*  Right.
*  Well, thank you for the information.
*  And are you still there?
*  Hello?
*  Wow.
*  So these scammers were basically doing a good cop, bad cop routine to stop James from walking
*  away and to squeeze every last penny out of him.
*  Exactly.
*  If you provide me your email contact information, I will certainly be happy to forward all of
*  the wire transfer information from my bank account to you so that you can see where those
*  funds went.
*  Yeah, that would be great.
*  I have your email.
*  James asks me, a reporter who's based in Mexico, who speaks the language, if I could help him
*  figure out where his money had gone to.
*  Thank you very much.
*  I really appreciate your assistance.
*  I'm just doing my job.
*  Thanks again.
*  And we'll talk soon.
*  And the only way that I could figure that out was to understand who was on the other
*  side of the phone.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Maria, who was on the other side of that phone line?
*  So by the time that I'd met James, I'd already gotten a tip from US law enforcement agencies
*  that they were seeing a new trend.
*  Mexican drug cartels were getting involved in the timeshare scam industry.
*  Drug cartels?
*  Yeah.
*  Not just any drug cartel.
*  This is one of the most notorious violent, bloody drug cartels that exists in Mexico
*  and Latin America, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
*  And when I looked at James's bank records, guess what?
*  All the money that he was sending was going to various bank accounts that were all located
*  in Jalisco State in Mexico.
*  Wow.
*  So why would the drug cartels get into the timeshare scamming business?
*  It is a huge business.
*  The FBI told me that it's about $300 million in profits over the last five years.
*  But the thing is that the potential for it to actually be multitudes more is huge because
*  the FBI estimates that most of the scams are actually not even reported.
*  In fact, only about 20% are.
*  So that means the total timeshare scam business could actually be much larger than the $300
*  million that they have knowledge of over the last five years.
*  But wait, I thought the drug business was a pretty lucrative business in itself.
*  So why get into the scamming of elderly people for their properties in Lake Tahoe?
*  Well, you have to remember that these drug cartels, they're not just doing one thing,
*  they're doing multiple things.
*  They're essentially conglomerates because it's really expensive to run a cartel.
*  You need to pay off officials, both Mexican and American.
*  You need to maintain basically an army in order to secure your routes up to the United
*  States, ports of entry into Mexico from Colombia.
*  And like any big business, you need to diversify your income to make sure that you keep the
*  money flowing because you never know when one business is going to be shut down by authorities
*  or taken over by your rivals.
*  We've reported that they're now in the avocado business and the construction business.
*  And timeshare fraud is basically no different than any of those.
*  So we're seeing that the cartels have their fingers in many pies, the legitimate and the
*  illegitimate economy here in Mexico.
*  It's kind of fascinating to think of these drug cartels as sprawling, diversified business
*  empires.
*  But when did the cartels first get into the scamming business?
*  So Jalisco New Generation started about 15 years ago.
*  And when they started to consolidate their empire in Jalisco State, they found that there
*  were all these scammed timeshare call centers all over the state that were being run by
*  various players and that this was a huge, huge moneymaker because essentially all you
*  have to do is call up retired senior citizens in the U.S. and Canada.
*  It doesn't take that much money to run that kind of a scheme.
*  There's no products you're making.
*  So essentially, they conducted a hostile takeover of these call centers.
*  They went in, they kicked down doors and dragged out the people who were managing these call
*  centers by their hair and threatened to kill them unless they gave up the call centers
*  or started handing over a cut of what they made.
*  And slowly, slowly, Jalisco New Generation Cartel took over the entire timeshare fraud
*  industry.
*  Interesting.
*  Were you able to find any of these call centers?
*  These call centers are pretty hard to find.
*  They look like any other storefront.
*  But I was able to visit two that were located in an upscale neighborhood in Guadalajara,
*  which is the capital of Jalisco State.
*  And it was just really perturbing because it was just so normal.
*  Two villas about a mile away from each other outside of one villa.
*  The parents were walking by holding their children's hands as they, you know, did drop
*  off at school.
*  It was right next to a park where people taking their morning exercise or their dogs for a
*  walk.
*  There was no real sign that the cartel was doing business there.
*  But a few months before, Mexican law enforcement had found the bodies of eight young people
*  who had used to work at one of these call centers and said that the Jalisco Cartel had
*  killed them.
*  Wow.
*  What happened?
*  So I wasn't able to talk directly to any of the victims' families.
*  They're just too scared.
*  But in general, this is usually how it starts.
*  The cartel seeks out English speakers to work for their call centers.
*  Sometimes they don't even tell them what exactly they're doing.
*  They would tell the recruits that the job was adjacent to the hotel industry.
*  You have to remember Jalisco is a huge, huge tourism magnet for Americans and Canadians
*  and others.
*  And the cartel would get their call lists from bribing hotel employees to give them
*  the names of people who stayed at these hotels and also at the timeshare resorts.
*  And the people who would work at the call centers are provided the names and a manual
*  of what you need to do when you call, kind of like a loose script of how to try to suck
*  as much money as you can out of these people up north in Canada and the States.
*  So we don't know for sure what exactly happened with the eight young Mexicans who were killed
*  last year.
*  But through an intermediary, one sibling told us that when their family member knew what
*  their job actually was, they became extremely uncomfortable and tried to leave the call
*  center, find another job maybe.
*  The Jalisco New Generation Cartel is known for being extremely brutal.
*  They chop off heads and they'll put them on the gates of a playground, for instance, so
*  that everybody in the neighborhood knows what went down.
*  And in this case, it's possible that they wanted to send a warning that there's no
*  defection from their timeshare call centers.
*  So basically making a very scary example of these guys in case anyone else is thinking
*  about quitting one of the call centers.
*  Exactly.
*  And one man who runs an organization who advocates for missing people and actually organizes
*  search parties to comb the forests of Jalisco State looking for the missing says that he
*  knows of about 30 people who have disappeared from the call centers in Jalisco State since 2017.
*  Hmm.
*  So while Americans and Canadians might be losing much of their life savings in Mexico,
*  this is actually deadly.
*  Are the authorities doing anything about this?
*  Not really.
*  Other than the fact that these two call centers were shut down, the authorities haven't arrested
*  others.
*  They're not putting pressure on Mexican banks, for instance, to look into these payments
*  coming from senior citizens in the US or Canada.
*  And you have to remember that people are really afraid.
*  But you also have to remember that in Mexico, things are not that clear.
*  There is a lot of corruption and government collusion with organized crime and cartels.
*  The tourism industry, it is huge in Mexico and particularly in Jalisco State.
*  This is a multi-billion dollar industry.
*  They don't want Americans or Canadians or Europeans who are coming to Jalisco for its
*  beautiful beaches and its mountains to hear about these stories regarding the cartels
*  being involved in the tourism industry and think, you know, I'm not going to send my
*  family there for that beach vacation.
*  It's just simply too dangerous.
*  So everybody has an incentive to have the scam continue, whether because they're too
*  afraid and don't want to speak out or because they're in on it.
*  So in a way, local authorities have an interest in sweeping it under the carpet in order to
*  just maintain this idea of a tourist destination.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, the spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office was very responsive to me until I told
*  her what I wanted to ask her questions about.
*  And then she just simply never answered any of my texts or phone calls.
*  So Maria, based on everything you know, all the information you have, would you say that
*  you're confident that the cartels were the ones who scammed James?
*  Yes, 100 percent.
*  I think I've seen points in that direction.
*  What did James say when you told him this?
*  So it took him quite a while to really allow himself to believe it.
*  On the advice of his lawyers, he stopped picking up the phone calls.
*  And about a week ago, they stopped after the scammers kept trying to call him.
*  But you said he was in it for over a year.
*  Why do you think it took him so long?
*  Can you tell me after all of that that had been presented to you, why do you think you
*  weren't willing to be entirely convinced?
*  Well, I actually asked him that question.
*  That's a very good question.
*  Why wasn't I able to pick up on that right away?
*  And I think in the back of my mind, I'm finding out that I'm a little more stubborn than I
*  thought I was.
*  And for him, it was pretty complicated.
*  And I think that I didn't want to believe that I had fallen for this.
*  I didn't feel I was that foolish and stupid when it came to this.
*  You know, I guess I didn't want to believe that I could be fooled.
*  To come to terms with the fact that he had lost so much money was to come to terms with
*  the fact that he wasn't the person that he thought that he was.
*  That he wasn't this kind of, you know, clever, former law enforcement officer who was used
*  to fighting the bad guys and winning.
*  You know, I'm disappointed in myself.
*  There's a huge level of anger towards the perpetrators.
*  And yeah, all of those things wrapped into one.
*  And part of that, I think, contributes to not wanting to actually believe that I was wrong.
*  Yeah, I hear you.
*  I'm sorry I can hear the pain in your voice.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Some of it's based on shame, right?
*  That he lost all this money, everything that he's worked for.
*  And the fact that this was all supposed to be money that his children and his grandchildren
*  were going to inherit.
*  And now it's gone.
*  And have you told your daughter that you think you've kind of come to terms with the fact
*  that this might have been a scam?
*  Oh, she's been involved.
*  Yeah, they know.
*  My daughter does.
*  I'm sorry.
*  This is a tough time.
*  Yeah.
*  So I've got to make some sort of arrangements to compensate them for this on top of our
*  regular debt.
*  So yeah, it's been a swell experience.
*  All of it brought on by my, evidently, my stubbornness to believe that I couldn't possibly
*  be a victim.
*  How's your wife doing throughout this whole process with this new knowledge?
*  She's not real happy, obviously, at all.
*  I hear a lot of, I told you so.
*  And at this point, I've got no defense.
*  She's absolutely right.
*  No question about it.
*  Do you worry this is going to affect your marriage?
*  Yes.
*  There has been an effect.
*  And do you think that at this point, there's any way for James and his family to get some
*  kind of justice or at least find some kind of closure?
*  Justice unlikely.
*  At this point, I'm not necessarily expecting much in the way of restitution.
*  And as for closure, it's a little bit too soon to tell.
*  In a way, James has gone through several stages of acceptance for what happened.
*  There's fear, there's shame, there's resignation.
*  And now he's talking to me, partly because he feels like it's a public service, that
*  he needs to be vocal so that other people don't go through what he's gone through and
*  fall for the scam.
*  And I think it also kind of helps him feel a little bit empowered in a situation for
*  over the last year and a half.
*  He was kind of at the mercy of these people who were calling him multiple times a week.
*  I want to try to get as much information to as many of these official organizations as
*  possible.
*  I have a streak of anger through me now that I've developed to the point where I'm not
*  this go.
*  Well, Maria, thank you.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  O.J. Simpson, the football star who was accused and later acquitted of murdering his former
*  wife and her friend, died of cancer at his home in Las Vegas, his family said Thursday.
*  He was 76.
