# The Fight Over the Next Pandemic
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbWnEK7aTRA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, at the height of the COVID pandemic, nearly 200 countries started negotiating a
*  plan to ensure they did better when the next pandemic inevitably arrives.
*  Their deadline for that plan was last week.
*  My colleague, Apoorva Mondavili, explains why so far those negotiations have failed.
*  It's Thursday, June 6th.
*  So Apoorva, something that was supposed to happen and happen right now that I think most
*  of us didn't even know was ever in the works hasn't happened.
*  And that's a global plan for the next pandemic.
*  So tell us this entire story.
*  Think back to 2021, the very worst days of COVID when we had thousands of people dying
*  in the US and in the rest of the world.
*  There was just so much confusion about whether to wear masks or not, whether to close schools.
*  And it was very difficult to think what any country should do.
*  Right.
*  And so in the middle of that chaos and confusion, the eagle has landed.
*  Carrying the hopes of the country, the first shipment of coronavirus vaccines reach Australian
*  skies.
*  We did get the vaccines.
*  You're watching right now history being made.
*  We're one of the first people in the entire country right here to get dose number two
*  of the Pfizer vaccine.
*  All of a sudden, there was this hope.
*  But the thing is that those vaccines were really mostly available in the richer countries.
*  Parts of Asia and Latin America have recorded a spike in COVID fatalities amid medical supply
*  and vaccine shortages.
*  Few people in Africa have been vaccinated.
*  Some countries don't have any vaccines at all.
*  So we in the United States and a lot of countries in the European Union and some of the other
*  high and middle income countries had the vaccines.
*  Rich countries have enough doses to vaccinate everyone nearly three times over, whilst poor
*  countries don't have enough to even reach health workers and people at risk.
*  But elsewhere in the world, there were no vaccines, really.
*  It became obvious to some low and middle income countries that they were not going to do very
*  well in this pandemic.
*  There were all these advanced purchase orders from the richer countries and they were having
*  some very tough negotiations with pharma companies that were charging them more than they were
*  charging the rich countries.
*  And by the end of that horrible, horrible year, more than 90% of people in the richer
*  countries had had two doses of vaccine.
*  But 2% of people in low income countries had had any vaccines.
*  So that really just striking inequity made people realise this was just a mess.
*  We did not know how to deal with the pandemic.
*  The time to act is now.
*  So in December 2021, by the end of this year of inequity,
*  We must not allow the memories of this crisis to fade and go back to business as usual.
*  The World Health Organization brought together all the countries.
*  The impacts on our societies, economies and health, especially for the poor and the most
*  vulnerable are too significant.
*  And launched this process to come up with a playbook to really think about how all the
*  countries of the world need to prevent and respond to the next pandemic and do it in
*  a way that would protect everybody, rich and poor across the world.
*  And the WHO decided that this discussion could not be just an informal conversation between
*  health ministers, that this needed to be an international treaty, a legally binding treaty,
*  so that every country has to take this very seriously and everybody agrees on how to do
*  this next time.
*  Hmm.
*  So at the very height of COVID's awfulness, these countries in the WHO are saying, we
*  know you all are very, very busy fighting this pandemic.
*  It is taking up all your time and energy, but we need you to now start to think about
*  how badly this is going and not just fight the current pandemic, but start planning on
*  a better way to fight the next one.
*  That's kind of a big ask.
*  It is a big ask, but what is the alternative that we come to the next pandemic and have
*  a repeat of all of the chaos and confusion we saw during COVID?
*  So I think it was an acknowledgement that we needed it.
*  We needed to come up with a plan.
*  And it became obvious that part of that plan needed to be a way to repair the mistrust
*  that had formed between low income countries and high income countries, and that without
*  repairing that, we just did not really stand a good chance of fighting the next pandemic.
*  Right.
*  And of course, the thing about a global pandemic is that any weak link, any country that's
*  not doing its part or getting what it needs becomes a problem for every other country.
*  That's the nature of a pandemic.
*  We need, we talked about this with you, we talked about this with our colleagues throughout
*  the pandemic, a system where there's a strong program and plan in every country so that
*  the virus can be stamped out.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, in the United States, more people died because of variants than they did because
*  of the original virus.
*  And a lot of those variants started in countries that did not have access to vaccines.
*  Okay, so what do these talks start to actually look like?
*  And just how many countries end up being involved in them?
*  So all of the countries that are member states of the World Health Organization were involved
*  in this.
*  It's 194 countries.
*  Wow.
*  And they all sent delegates to meet, to draft something, and then to discuss every aspect
*  of it and try to come to a consensus.
*  The goal was to get that to a point where all the countries were ready to sign off
*  on it by May 2024.
*  They had meetings over a period of two and a half years to talk through this.
*  Some sections they all agreed on pretty easily.
*  You can imagine the general goals, like, yes, we should have a good plan to fight a pandemic,
*  or yes, we should have good research on vaccines and drugs, things like that, the general sort
*  of philosophical goals everybody agrees on.
*  Principles are always the easiest thing to negotiate.
*  Easiest thing to negotiate.
*  But then you start getting into how this happens, right?
*  And it's actually kind of interesting in the draft.
*  If you look at the drafts, they have areas that are green, which means everybody sort
*  of agreed, and yellow, which means they're starting to come to an agreement.
*  There's sort of general consensus.
*  And then white, which means it's like really no agreement.
*  They're just not even on the same page.
*  And when you look at what's green across all of these drafts, the philosophical goals,
*  green from the start, no problem.
*  The yellow started to come slowly, these areas of consensus, things like, for example, safety
*  measures in the labs that work with dangerous viruses.
*  And that's not just because one of the theories about COVID is that the virus leaked from
*  a lab.
*  We know from long before COVID that lab safety is very important for making sure that those
*  dangerous viruses don't get out into the world.
*  There's also agreement around how countries should do surveillance to see what outbreaks
*  might be emerging.
*  And some of that stuff is tricky.
*  Why is it tricky?
*  I mean, isn't there a pretty standard playbook for trying to detect a virus and what to do
*  once you detect it?
*  Sure.
*  But there are some things that are big sticking points, like money.
*  Not all countries have the resources to do the kind of surveillance that they need to
*  do.
*  And so who funds that?
*  You know, some countries have vested interests like Argentina wouldn't want any rules that
*  forbid export of certain kinds of meat products, because that's a big part of their economy.
*  There are countries where live animal markets are a thing.
*  And not just in China, which we're all familiar with as another origin theory for COVID.
*  Lots of other countries rely on these markets.
*  And they don't want to have very strict rules about which animals can be held together and
*  how densely packed they can or can't be.
*  So when you start to get into the details, it is actually difficult to reach consensus
*  on some of these things.
*  But they have made a lot of progress and they have come to yellow and green on some important
*  things like that every country should have a health care workforce trained to respond
*  to a pandemic, that they should make best efforts to have local production of things
*  like vaccines and drugs, and that they should provide all of these resources to their own
*  citizens.
*  Things like that, those are all under agreement.
*  They're all green now.
*  So what exactly is holding these negotiations back?
*  What ends up being the biggest remaining conflict?
*  It won't surprise you to hear, Michael, that the biggest conflict is exactly what all of
*  this began with, which is the lack of access that low income countries have to things like
*  vaccines.
*  There have been interesting proposals in the drafts and one in particular that would solve
*  at least some of this issue, but it's been very difficult to convince rich countries,
*  middle income countries and low income countries that that proposal would be of great benefit
*  to everybody involved.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Apoorva, tell us about this particular proposal that could do a lot of work to solve
*  the inequities at the center of these negotiations and why that proposal has created so much
*  conflict.
*  The heart of the section that has really created the most conflict is whether low income countries
*  get access to vaccines in a timely manner and at a cost that is affordable to them.
*  And all the low income countries recognize that they don't have a lot of bargaining power.
*  They were treated pretty poorly by pharma companies during this past pandemic.
*  And so they've been thinking about setting things up so that that does not happen again,
*  that the next time around they are not left behind.
*  Right.
*  But like you said, they don't have a lot of power to bargain.
*  They don't.
*  There have been times when poor countries have come up with a way to make everybody
*  else realize that they're essential to this whole process.
*  So let me give you an example of this that really, I think, illustrates how much everybody
*  else needs the low income nations during an outbreak.
*  So in 2006, Indonesia was battling a bird flu outbreak.
*  And they had been very dutifully sending samples of the virus that they had in their
*  country to the World Health Organization labs to analyze.
*  That information helps pharma companies develop things like vaccines.
*  Or tests, right.
*  Or tests.
*  And in this particular case, the Indonesian Health Ministry approached the World Health
*  Organization to say, look, we've given you these samples.
*  We have people dying in our country and we need access to vaccines and drugs.
*  And the WHO told them, sorry, we don't directly distribute any of that.
*  You have to talk to the manufacturers.
*  And this is where that leverage becomes really important, right.
*  Because Indonesia did not actually have leverage with these pharma companies.
*  And so the vaccine manufacturer told them that they would sell them vaccines, but at
*  commercial prices that that country cannot afford.
*  And then a drug manufacturer told them that they did not have enough drugs to give Indonesia
*  because richer countries had placed enough purchase orders that there was a delay of
*  two years.
*  So Indonesia was so angry about all of this that they declined to share any more samples
*  with the WHO.
*  So Indonesia basically says we will never again make the mistake of promptly sharing
*  information about a potentially deadly pathogen because we learn that we get nothing in
*  return. Right.
*  And that understanding, that realization also has driven a lot of the conversation in the
*  drafting of this treaty, where low income countries have essentially said, we recognize that
*  you need us to share these samples, but we are not going to do that unless you can promise to us
*  that we will get some access to vaccines and drugs that you make based on the samples we
*  give you. So we want something in return for the information we provide to you.
*  What is the specific proposal that comes from this realization?
*  Yeah, this proposal has created a lot of controversy.
*  So there are versions of it.
*  But the most recent one says essentially that if the low income countries share their
*  samples with the WHO, that pharma companies have to give the WHO 10 percent of the vaccines
*  they make as a donation and then 10 percent either at a nonprofit cost or just a deeply
*  discounted rate also to the WHO.
*  And then the WHO would distribute that 20 percent of vaccines that they get from the pharma
*  companies to the countries that are in most need.
*  So this proposal, which feels very innovative, is the ultimate manifestation of poor
*  countries' power in this dynamic.
*  If they don't get vaccines, then the big countries will never get the information about a
*  virus that's necessary for there to have ever been a vaccine.
*  It's really interesting.
*  It isn't. And this is the biggest chip that low income countries have.
*  So they are not willing to budge on this.
*  But guess who doesn't like this?
*  Pharmaceutical companies and the countries that really support the interests of the
*  pharmaceutical companies. And that includes the United States, Germany, Switzerland, some of the
*  big players, places where these companies are a big presence and a very powerful lobby.
*  What specifically have these pharmaceutical companies and the countries like the U.S.
*  that have so many of them said about this proposal?
*  So the countries, they are willing to give in principle and say that the pharmaceutical
*  companies will voluntarily give some of the vaccines to the WHO, but they don't want it
*  mandated. Whereas the low income countries, they want it to be.
*  Really codified so that there is no loophole.
*  And the conversations have gone round and round on that one word voluntary.
*  Apoorva, is it safe to assume that a country like the U.S., which of course has a booming and very
*  profitable pharmaceutical industry, won't sign on to these proposals unless that word
*  voluntary is in the deal, that they cannot abide by one where it's mandatory that these big
*  pharmaceutical companies have to give up so much of their vaccine to poor countries?
*  They are not going to say that in so many words, but yes, and the United States actually has come up
*  with some very nice plans to help some of these low income countries set up infrastructure and be
*  prepared for pandemics. But I think crossing pharmaceutical companies is not a place they will go.
*  So is that really the only big obstacle left in these negotiations or is there anything else?
*  Oh, there's lots more. There has been so much misinformation and disinformation around this
*  whole issue, just like there has been about every aspect of COVID. And a lot of it centers around
*  the hesitation and the opposition that many populist leaders have expressed. In the U.S.,
*  for example, there are Republican senators and governors who have come out against the treaty.
*  And they say that this is a power grab by the WHO, that it is going to allow the director general
*  of the WHO to tell the U.S. what to do, whether to have mask mandates, whether to have vaccine
*  mandates, none of which is true, by the way. And in a bid to counter some of that misinformation,
*  there is actually an explicit line in the treaty saying that the treaty respects the sovereignty
*  of all the individual nations. They've tried to address that head on, but it hasn't really
*  made all of that chatter go away. How much does this practically matter, the fact that a handful
*  or perhaps more than a handful of Republicans in the U.S. are skeptical of this and think,
*  ideologically speaking, that it oversteps the bounds of what a treaty should do? I mean,
*  ultimately, do they have any power over whether the U.S. signs this treaty?
*  They do, because delegates can agree to this treaty at the WHO, but everybody has to bring
*  it back to their home countries. And in the U.S., the treaty then has to be approved for
*  ratification by the Senate. You have to have a two-thirds majority in the Senate saying,
*  yes, we agree to this treaty. So if you have a number of Republican senators who are absolutely
*  opposed to it, it may not pass. So it very much feels like so many of the issues that made everyone
*  think this treaty was necessary, inequities between rich countries and poor countries,
*  and misinformation and ideological skepticism of how to handle a pandemic to begin with,
*  that really defined COVID for us, that those forces are now making it very hard for this
*  treaty to actually be reached. They never really went away.
*  They never went away. It felt like there was about five seconds when everyone was united in thinking
*  that we needed something different and there was a lot of goodwill. But a lot of that has
*  evaporated. And we're getting very quickly to a point where people have forgotten what COVID
*  looked like and felt like and what the devastation was like, and have gone back to old positions on,
*  you know, we don't want to share, we don't want to give anything away, everything for us first,
*  all of the thinking that led to the problems during COVID.
*  So what realistically happens now? And do you, based on your reporting, think that this treaty
*  has any real chance of being completed and passed by the 194 countries involved in it?
*  D.P. Well, the draft was supposed to be finalized at the meeting last week of the World Health
*  Assembly, and that didn't happen. But they did set a deadline to say that the negotiations will
*  continue and then they'll hope to have something done by next year's meeting. But there's just so
*  much in flux right now. You know, there are elections all over the world. Who knows what
*  Donald Trump will do if he gets elected? We know that he withdrew from the WHO the last time around.
*  And he has even said that he may shut down the pandemic preparedness office in the White House.
*  So he's not particularly invested in this whole topic, this whole issue.
*  And in the meantime, we already have so many threats that are really picking up, you know,
*  for global health experts and for reporters like myself who watch all this stuff. It's a bit
*  alarming that we now have bird flu right here in the United States.
*  And the next pandemic, pretty much every expert I talk to agrees, it's not a question of if but when.
*  And if we had had this treaty ready, if we can ever have this treaty ready, we would be so much
*  better prepared for something like that to happen. But it just doesn't seem all that likely right now.
*  Well, LaPurva, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In a last minute about face, New York Governor Kathy
*  Hogle said she would block a long awaited tolling plan known as congestion pricing
*  that was set to begin at the end of the month. The program, the first of its kind in the U.S.,
*  would have charged as much as $15 for cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan.
*  The goal was to alleviate traffic, reduce pollution, and raise money for the city's
*  aging subway system. But Hogle argued that the tolls
*  threatened the city's fragile economic recovery after the pandemic.
*  And on Thursday, former romantic partners of Hunter Biden, the president's son,
*  testified in a Delaware courtroom about the depths of his drug addiction and the toll that it took on
*  them. The testimony, including how much Hunter Biden spent on drugs and the type of drugs he
*  used, was designed to establish that he was a chronic drug abuser who lied when he claimed to
*  be sober on an application for a handgun in 2018. Today's episode was produced by Alex Stern,
