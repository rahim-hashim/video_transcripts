# Trump Picks His Running Mate — and Political Heir
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ_P22FQPLo)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, on the first day of the Republican National Convention, Donald Trump makes his
*  choice of a running mate.
*  We watched it unfold in real time from Milwaukee.
*  This Tuesday, July 16th.
*  Are you okay?
*  I'm getting phone interference.
*  Oh no, maybe that's from your phone.
*  There's like 16 phones in this car.
*  No, not the most part of it.
*  Okay.
*  It is 9.35 a.m. on Monday morning, and we are driving into downtown Milwaukee to the
*  headquarters of the Republican National Convention.
*  It's day one, the opening hours of what will be the Republican Party's crowning of their
*  nominee, former President Donald Trump.
*  The singular event that hangs over this entire convention is the one that none of us expected,
*  which is the attempted assassination of the presumptive Republican nominee.
*  The news is just flying at us this morning.
*  We just got word that he's going to be announcing his running mate today.
*  His choice of a VP.
*  So this is pretty extraordinary day already, before 10 a.m.
*  And we're going to try to make sense of it all.
*  We just went through the first round of Secret Service asking to see our badges.
*  We are now stopped at a giant metal pop-up wall.
*  And in front of us, cars are being slowly and very thoroughly inspected by bomb-sniffing
*  dogs and security teams.
*  Hi.
*  Hi, you guys are good?
*  You just have to get the screen through the checkpoint.
*  Perfect.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Secret Service.
*  Turn the engine off.
*  Pop the hood for me, please.
*  Oh, the front hood.
*  How do I do that?
*  We're in a rental car.
*  Here we go.
*  She's got it.
*  Look at her.
*  And also, don't run into my barricade.
*  People keep doing that even though it says stop on it.
*  You know?
*  Keep your eyes open.
*  All righty?
*  Be safe everybody.
*  Thank you so much.
*  So we're headed in deeper security.
*  You got your sunglasses?
*  Can you back up for me real quick?
*  Michael?
*  Yeah.
*  Good.
*  Carlos?
*  Good to go.
*  And Rachel?
*  Yes.
*  Good to go.
*  Thank you.
*  There wasn't a single package inside that bag that they didn't search.
*  Hi.
*  Check in over here.
*  Thank you guys for coming.
*  I can take over snacks.
*  Once we made it through all that security, we walked into the first official event of
*  the day, a briefing for reporters from the Trump campaign about what this first day of
*  the convention would look like.
*  So we're inside a very big ballroom that has a podium and two flags set up next to it.
*  Wisconsin, United States.
*  There's about 200 journalists in here filling a quarter of the room and a lot of red-shirted
*  RNC staffers and volunteers who are kind of corralling us.
*  Now we're going to wait and see what they have to say.
*  But just as this briefing was about to begin, we were told that it was for planning purposes
*  only and that we couldn't use any of the audio from it.
*  I just want to summarize what we heard in this news conference.
*  Essentially what senior advisors to the Trump campaign just told us is that this day is
*  going to be very action-packed.
*  It is going to begin in the early afternoon with the official technical nomination by
*  delegates of Trump as the Republican nominee.
*  And then in the early afternoon, around 3 o'clock or so, the nomination of a vice presidential
*  candidate will occur.
*  What that means is that sometime between now, 10.30 a.m. or so, and 3 p.m., we will know
*  the identity of who Trump's running mate will be.
*  And finally, we are going to lay eyes on Donald Trump himself at around 9 p.m. in the evening
*  and the crowd is going to go wild because it's the first time many of them, many of
*  us will have seen him since the assassination attempt.
*  So it's a really packed schedule filled with a giant piece of news in the middle, which
*  is who Trump picked as his running mate.
*  Mike Bender.
*  Hello.
*  To get inside Trump's decision-making, we turn to our colleague Mike Bender, a politics
*  reporter at the Times who's been on the VP beat for the past few months.
*  OK, we just want to bug you for a minute about what is the status of the VP choice.
*  Last time we talked to you, you told us there were three top contenders, Doug Burgum, Governor
*  of North Dakota, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Ohio Senator JD Vass.
*  So like where do things sit here at 11 at noon on Monday?
*  Just hours before he's actually supposed to make the announcement and nominate the
*  running mate.
*  I mean, I literally ran into a couple of sources who are with other VP contenders who are telling
*  me that they haven't received word one way or the other yet.
*  I don't think he's told the person yet.
*  I mean, we're three hours from a nomination.
*  I seriously do not think that Trump has actually made the formal offer yet.
*  We have to like, I think we have to just like explain that to people.
*  We're three hours from the necessary public disclosure of this information, and it's not
*  clear that the decision has been made.
*  Yeah, no, it's amazing.
*  I mean, Trump is known to vacillate over big decisions.
*  He did almost the same thing back in 2016 when he picked Mike Pence.
*  He decided to pick Mike Pence and then spent the night before their first news conference
*  together, complaining to aides that he had made the wrong choice, wondering if he could
*  pick someone differently.
*  My reporting over the last week has been that he's been going through similar iterations
*  on this decision.
*  So we're going to lightly stalk you until we get the news, and hopefully when we get
*  the news, you can break it to us, or it will be broken over our heads and then we'll talk
*  about it.
*  It will make sense.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  I am also hoping to be the first to know, and if I'm the first to know, you guys will
*  be the second to know.
*  Okay, thank you, Michael.
*  Just as we finished talking to Mike, he made a phone call.
*  Hey, you don't think, why don't you think it's Marco?
*  He called?
*  Like just now?
*  Okay, I just saw some folks outside who, for another contender, who haven't heard anything
*  yet.
*  So, I mean, that was 30 minutes ago, so I'm wondering if it's happening now.
*  No, I didn't see that.
*  Okay.
*  Okay, okay.
*  Thanks, bye.
*  So can you just tell us about that phone call you had?
*  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
*  This was someone who is very close with one of the VP contenders, one of the final three.
*  This contender just received a call from Trump's team saying he's not the pick.
*  Soon enough, Mike confirmed that Marco Rubio had been crossed off the VP list and that
*  Rubio wasn't the only VP contender to receive that call.
*  So it's 1.30 p.m. and this is a little unorthodox, but I'm peeking over the shoulder of my colleague
*  Mike Bender and I can see that he's writing the following.
*  Both Doug Burgum and Marco Rubio have been told that they are not Trump's VP choice,
*  so in real time, assuming that this is right, we're left thinking that the choice is either
*  JD Vance or some wild card person who we haven't even thought of.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to begin a very important part of our program.
*  I would like to ask that the aisles be cleared and the delegates please take their seats.
*  Thank you.
*  In the meantime, the official business of this convention began.
*  The nomination of Trump as the Republican nominee.
*  Michael tell me what's happening.
*  So at this point, 2 p.m., the roll call of delegates is underway on the floor of the
*  convention hall.
*  West Virginia, 32 delegates.
*  So what's happening right now is that the delegates from each state are publicly pledging
*  their support to Donald Trump and the delegates from each state represent the outcome of the
*  primary vote that happened many, many months ago.
*  So like right now, West Virginia's designated speaker with a red hard hat on is saying
*  from the great state of West Virginia.
*  And to cast those 32 votes for our former and future president, Donald J. Trump.
*  We are pledging our 32 delegates to Donald Trump and on and on and on it will go.
*  And so this is a formality, adding up all the delegates from all the states, but it's
*  actually a technically required component of Donald Trump becoming and accepting his
*  party's nomination.
*  And Trump will become the official nominee when 1215 delegates in this room have pledged
*  their support to him, which will probably be in about like 30 minutes.
*  I stand before you today on behalf of the great state of New Hampshire.
*  And after Trump is nominated, this entire exercise happens all over again for his running
*  mate whose identity we still don't know.
*  So that's where a lot of the suspense of this moment is, not in the obvious fact that
*  Donald Trump's about to be nominated, but that everyone in this room is about to nominate
*  a running mate that they don't know the identity of, that we don't know the identity of.
*  And we have to know the identity of it before it happens.
*  And all of a sudden, after not knowing how or when we would learn Trump's choice, we
*  finally do.
*  And it's delivered in classic Trump fashion.
*  So I've just seen on True Social that Trump has announced his VP pick and it is JD Vance
*  of Ohio.
*  Daily editor Rachel Quester breaking the news that it's Vance, which we kind of thought
*  it would be.
*  But now we know.
*  After the break, Vance's nomination and why Trump picked him.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so we're walking to the convention hall.
*  It's a bit of a trek.
*  It's very hot outside and blazingly bright.
*  And we are now entering the media doorway.
*  How are you?
*  Thank you.
*  Where are we going?
*  We're out trying to get.
*  To the floor.
*  To the floor.
*  Okay, just right out there and then somebody on the direct G.
*  Okay.
*  Around 3.30 or so, we walked out onto the convention floor just as Vance was being nominated
*  as Trump's running mate.
*  All right, time for a little convention business here.
*  The question is on the motion that Senator JD Vance be nominated by acclamation.
*  This room is about to complete the nomination of Vance as VP.
*  All those opposed signify by saying no.
*  In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it and the motion is adopted.
*  Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
*  And just to give you a little bit of a sense of the feel of the room, JD Vance is smiling
*  really widely.
*  He's leaning back.
*  He's laughing.
*  The crowd is chanting JD JD and he seems a little in awe of the moment.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to announce that Senator JD Vance has the overwhelming
*  support of this convention to be the next vice president of the United States.
*  And that's that JD Vance vice presidential nominee.
*  We got to get out of here.
*  When that was over, we headed back to where Mike Bender was working to talk to him about
*  Trump's choice.
*  Welcome to the Daily Studio here in Milwaukee.
*  Awesome.
*  Can we close this door?
*  You can shut that.
*  Yeah.
*  Mike, you ready?
*  Yep.
*  So if you believe that Donald Trump made this decision, as we think he did, kind of last
*  minute, even if you've been thinking about it for a long time, what's your understanding
*  of why he chose JD Vance?
*  I think Trump is making this pick on who he thinks gives him the best chance to win in
*  November.
*  He announced this decision in a Truth Social Post and mentioned a couple of key states
*  in that statement, essentially saying that he thinks Vance can help him win in Pennsylvania,
*  in Michigan, Wisconsin.
*  These are essential states for victory in November, both for Trump and President Biden.
*  Trump won them in 2016, but lost to Biden in those same states in 2020.
*  He's very openly saying, I have made a strategic choice.
*  What's interesting about that, Mike, is that in our conversation a couple of weeks ago,
*  when we talked about who Trump was looking at closely, you had said that he wasn't thinking
*  about these traditional questions of does my VP win me X state, Y state?
*  He was engaging in questions of personal rapport, and he got along really well with Doug Burgum.
*  So clearly the strategic question became front of mind for Trump.
*  And I just want to understand, was there something in the race that changed that made him suddenly
*  think about this or what?
*  Well, well, well, look at the daily fact checking its reporters here on air.
*  Well, you're not wrong either, Michael.
*  There has been a shift in the last few weeks with Trump.
*  He's gone from talking about finding a running mate who could help him govern to finding
*  a running mate who can help him govern and someone who can help him win.
*  And when he ran the analysis here, when he looked at the different set of candidates
*  he has, his ultimate decision was that JD Vance is the one who can do that.
*  Vance will take him deeper into the states where he needs to win in the Midwest and appeal
*  directly to the working class blue collar voters.
*  He needs to capture these battlegrounds.
*  Explain exactly why he thinks JD Vance helps him win those three or so key states.
*  What is it about Vance's story that maps onto that strategy?
*  The answer is both biographical and rooted in policy.
*  Vance is a child of Appalachia.
*  I grew up in a poor working class neighborhood in Ohio.
*  I served in the military.
*  And when he decided to run for his first elected office in 2022, he was very far right on a
*  lot of issues.
*  He is one of the most staunch anti-abortion voices in the Senate right now.
*  He's an economic populist, a sort of anti-trade isolationist.
*  He was one of the first voices urging the Senate to vote against aid for Ukraine at
*  a time where his party leaders were supporting that.
*  So for Trump, when it comes to selling the idea of Trumpism and MAGAism, JD Vance is
*  a very effective communicator for him, particularly in a crucial area of the country, that if
*  Trump wins some of these Midwestern states could mean the end of Biden as president.
*  So we should see this decision as Trump picking someone who is ideologically extremely aligned
*  with him, perhaps even a little further to the right than Trump, an issue like abortion,
*  from and of the place in the country that Trump needs to win the Midwest, Appalachia.
*  And that combination means for Trump, Vance.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I think it's also helpful to kind of put this in the context of the other contenders.
*  Vance is not bringing a new piece of the puzzle to Trumpism.
*  Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida, would have been a Spanish speaking advocate who
*  may appeal more to Latinos.
*  Governor Doug Burgum from North Dakota could have helped settle down that pro-business
*  Republicans who are nervous about Trump's unpredictability.
*  Trump is sort of signaling here that he's not interested in adding to the party.
*  He doesn't want to make the tent bigger.
*  He's doubling down on this sort of white working class, pro-MAGA piece of the party that he
*  sees not just as a way to win in November, but very clearly the path for the party in
*  the future.
*  Of all the candidates Trump was thinking about for VP, and we've talked about this with you,
*  they went on a journey, right, from Trump skeptic to Trump supporter.
*  But JD Vance's journey stood out because he was so unstinting in his criticism of Trump
*  when Trump first entered the political scene back in 2016.
*  I remember interviewing Vance and talking about this stuff.
*  He compared Trump to Hitler.
*  He called Trump the opioid of the masses.
*  He suggested Trump was a con man.
*  That's a lot to overcome, but he did.
*  But he did.
*  This is the most stunning 180 degree political flip-flop of our time.
*  To go from saying the sort of things that you just brought up to now being chosen as
*  his most trusted advisor, a running mate, a number two who will serve as president if
*  something should happen to him is extraordinary.
*  You may have to go back to post-revolutionary times when we used to pick vice presidents
*  by who came in second place to find a vice president who has said such searing criticisms
*  of a president.
*  Fascinating.
*  And ultimately, what's your understanding of why Trump could get past that?
*  Somebody who's not very good at accepting criticism.
*  No, that's true.
*  But as much as Trump hates criticism for his own actions and deeds, he loves the redemption
*  narrative and he loves being asked for forgiveness.
*  And JD Vance has spent several years seeking Trump's approval by going on television,
*  making nice with all of the right-wing websites and media in order to show how much he has
*  changed his mind on Trump.
*  And maybe most effectively, blame the media.
*  That point has been proven by Vance himself, who has explained his new thinking, his evolution
*  on Trump by saying he was lied to by a media narrative about Trump.
*  And now that he's gotten to know Trump, now that he's seen him Trump in action as president,
*  he has changed his mind.
*  Right.
*  And it sounds like he never really needed to change his mind about some of the fundamental
*  ideas of Trumpism.
*  He had to change his mind about Trump.
*  He seems always to have been fundamentally aligned with the ideas that Trump embraces,
*  economic populism, some pretty far-right social positions.
*  He needed to change his mind on the man, not the message.
*  Yeah, it was very personal, I think, for both Trump and Vance in this instance.
*  Vance is someone who grew up in rural Ohio, whose family is from Appalachia, saw some
*  of the things that Trump has railed against when it comes to manufacturing jobs that are
*  being shipped overseas, these sort of pillars and institutions of society that have failed
*  to uphold their end of the bargain when it comes to working class, blue collar, small-town
*  Americans like Vance's.
*  If you are the Democrats right now, Mike, and you're absorbing this news, where do
*  you see the greatest vulnerabilities are going to lie for Trump now picking Vance?
*  Democrats are definitely going to use Vance's old words against him, this sort of library
*  of video clips and audio interviews of Vance going after Trump.
*  But Democrats will also seize on Vance as an extremist, whether that's his ardent abortion
*  view and support for a national ban and his willingness to do what his predecessor, Mike
*  Pence, wouldn't.
*  Vance has been on record already saying that he would have blocked the certification of
*  the 2020 results and that would have helped overturn that election.
*  Right.
*  So you're saying one simple way that the Biden ticket can go after Vance is by saying that
*  you will enable Trump to break the law, overturn the election.
*  We should affect that.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  I mean, looking back on what happened after 2020, the system worked because there was
*  a lot of people around Trump who maybe they weren't guardrails, but maybe more speed bumps.
*  There's no indication that Vance has any willingness to play that role in the next Trump administration.
*  In that vein, it was pretty widely noted that in the hours after the attempted assassination
*  of Donald Trump, we saw J.D. Vance come out with a statement.
*  It was the most strongly worded of anyone seeking to be his VP.
*  And it has some factual problems.
*  Here's what he said.
*  He said, today, the attempted assassination is not just some isolated incident.
*  The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian
*  fascist who must be stopped at all costs.
*  That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.
*  We should say there's no evidence that that's true.
*  We don't know the motivations of the shooter.
*  We don't know that he consumed any of that rhetoric or that Vance is even characterizing
*  it correctly.
*  So what should we make of the fact that Trump chose that running mate who made that statement
*  in this moment?
*  I think Vance, in a lot of ways, embodies the id of Trump and that instinct to fight.
*  And even though these sort of manufactured statements from the campaign are calling for
*  unity and calling for peace, what Trump really wants...
*  Since the attempted assassination, right?
*  That's right.
*  What Trump really wants is someone who is going to keep fighting, be it factual or not.
*  I think this shows the passion and the energy Trump was looking at in running mate, valuing
*  that interest in fighting more than...
*  Interest in unity and peace.
*  Yeah, or facts on the ground.
*  Right.
*  I want to end, Mike, with something you hinted at earlier, which is when you said that Trump
*  is looking to Vance to set a path for the future of the Republican Party.
*  What is that path with Vance as number two?
*  Vance is only 39 years old.
*  He's barely old enough to be president.
*  Right, 35 is the requirement.
*  Exactly.
*  So he's obviously going to be viewed very much as the heir parent for Trumpism.
*  Trump knows this.
*  And the signal it's sending to everyone, not just in the party, but the rest of the country,
*  is that any remnants of a debate about whether this party snaps back to its sort of pro-business
*  establishment culture, pre-Trump era, the pre-Trump era is exactly that.
*  It's a pre-Trump era.
*  It's over for Republicans.
*  And when it's not Trump, it's going to be JD Vance or someone exactly like him.
*  Right.
*  In other words, Trumpism is here to stay.
*  It is the Republican Party now that I've chosen JD Vance.
*  There's no going back anymore, Michael.
*  Thank you, Mike.
*  This is really helpful.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  Back at the convention hall.
*  We wanted to ask folks from all the big swing states about the selection of JD Vance about
*  an hour ago and why and what you make of that decision and if you think it's going to help
*  Trump win this state.
*  Absolutely.
*  Look, I think the key thing in the platform is that it is dedicated to the forgotten men
*  and women and that is the blue collar workers in the flyover states.
*  JD Vance gets that.
*  It was clear that Republican delegates saw JD Vance as helping Trump win those key Midwestern
*  states that will be essential to Trump winning in November.
*  So if Donald Trump wins Pennsylvania, which we're going to make damn sure he does, we're
*  going to work our asses off.
*  You think that Vance helps him do that?
*  Yes.
*  And just make sure, I want to understand why.
*  Because JD Vance is like the common man.
*  He's like the common guy.
*  And that like Trump, they do see Vance as the future of Trumpism.
*  And the other thing is, he's young.
*  He's 39 years old.
*  So what's the matter?
*  It's good to have somebody young with somebody that's old in case, God forbid, something
*  ever happens to Trump.
*  In other words, you already see him as the successor, the inheritor of Trump's message
*  and the party in MAGA.
*  Yeah, he's going to have to carry the mantle.
*  That's probably what's going to end up happening.
*  Trump's only there for four years.
*  You need somebody afterwards for the next eight.
*  You need somebody for the next eight after that.
*  And you're from Wisconsin.
*  You're a delegate from Wisconsin.
*  This is important.
*  Trump mentioned Wisconsin in announcing Vance.
*  Why was Vance your number one choice?
*  I think he brings youth to the field, to the vice president.
*  And I looked at the upcoming years in 28, what will happen.
*  And I think he was the man that can do it in 28 for the Republican Party.
*  You're already looking forward to the next race?
*  Yes, very much so.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerdy.
*  In a stunning decision, the judge overseeing Trump's classified documents case threw out
*  all the charges against him.
*  In the process, she rejected what was widely seen as the strongest federal charges against
*  the former president.
*  Judge Eileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, ruled that the special counsel who filed the charges
*  had been given his job in violation of the Constitution.
*  That finding flew in the face of previous court decisions reaching back decades.
*  In response, the Department of Justice said that it plans to appeal Cannon's ruling.
