# Should You Rent or Buy? The New Math.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVVW0symuu8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, for many millennials, purchasing a home has become almost entirely out of reach.
*  So much so that we asked our colleague David Leonhard whether it's time to change, once
*  and for all, how we think about the wisdom of buying versus renting.
*  It's Friday, December 1st.
*  David, on yesterday's Daily, we talked to our colleague Gina Smilak about why this economy
*  has been so frustrating for younger Americans in particular.
*  And a big reason for that, as Gina mentioned, is the cost of housing.
*  In particular, the cost of home ownership, which feels almost entirely out of reach for
*  so many millennials because interest rates are so high right now and so are home prices.
*  And I'll be transparent with you, our team here at The Daily is made up of a lot of said
*  millennials who live in big cities, spend a lot of time on Zillow, and have gotten very
*  frustrated and they really want to know, will they ever be able to afford to buy a home?
*  So that caught us thinking, can we help listeners think about whether buying a home really makes
*  sense right now?
*  And naturally, David, we thought of you.
*  You've been writing about economics and housing for a very long time.
*  You once helped create a calculator for people to use to determine if home ownership is right
*  for them.
*  And you just wrote an entire book about the American dream of which home ownership is
*  so central.
*  I did.
*  So if you're somebody thinking about buying a home right now, should you just pretty much
*  give up on the idea, give up on the idea that has been seen as a ticket to adulthood and
*  a reliable path to creating wealth and just accept that you're going to be a renter?
*  Yes.
*  For most people, the answer is yes.
*  You should give up on the idea.
*  You shouldn't feel bad about it.
*  Renting has this unfair stigma in this country.
*  It kind of does, doesn't it?
*  It does.
*  But giving up on it now doesn't mean you're giving up on it forever.
*  Hmm.
*  Well, just very quickly, can you just give us, David, your shortest but most illuminating
*  explanation for why these prices are so stubbornly high?
*  Because for everything I know about economics, when the cost of buying a house goes up and
*  up and up because of interest rates, then demand for those houses should go down and
*  Therefore, people selling houses should have to lower the price.
*  Therefore prices should start falling.
*  But that hasn't happened.
*  You're absolutely right about that, Michael.
*  When interest rates go up, prices should come down.
*  But housing isn't a normal market and it doesn't adjust very quickly because people get in
*  their heads, we're not willing to sell our house for less than this amount.
*  So imagine a family that bought a house for $600,000 and put $100,000 into a new kitchen.
*  They're just not willing to sell their house for less than $700,000.
*  Right.
*  And that's basically what has happened now.
*  Sales have gone way down, the number of sales, but prices haven't adjusted that much.
*  And so for any individual, you're really in a tricky spot because interest rates have
*  gone way up in the last few years and house prices have not come down.
*  And you put that combination together and the cost of buying a house for families in
*  almost every market in the country is vastly higher than it was just a few years ago.
*  Right.
*  So for millennials, it's basically like lethally high.
*  Yes, because millennials are by definition younger than baby boomers or Generation X.
*  So millennials have not had decades to build up savings that can go toward a down payment.
*  And younger people tend to make less money on average than older people in the job market.
*  And so millennials just don't have the resources on average to buy homes that older people
*  can.
*  Okay.
*  So let's return to the case that you started to make that renting is okay.
*  Maybe better than okay.
*  It's good.
*  And that we can collectively let go of home ownership as our gold standard for a life
*  well lived.
*  I am happy to.
*  The rap on renting is that you're throwing money away because you're writing a check
*  to a landlord each month that doesn't build any equity in your home.
*  And that's absolutely true.
*  You are doing that when you rent.
*  But it's important to think about all of the ways that when you buy a home, you are also
*  throwing away money.
*  In fact, you're throwing away more money when you buy a home more quickly than when you
*  rent.
*  So I think there are four different ways to keep in mind that you're throwing money away
*  when you buy a home.
*  The first is the broker's fee, which is also known as the commission.
*  And in a typical transaction, this fee is about 6% of the house price.
*  On a $500,000 house, 6% equals $30,000.
*  On a $1 million house, and a lot of homes, including modest homes in the Northeast and
*  California cost a million dollars, that 6% fee equals $60,000.
*  Now technically, the seller and not the buyer pays this fee.
*  But in reality, that difference doesn't matter.
*  The fee comes out of the money that the buyer is paying and the fee inflates the home's
*  cost.
*  A broker's fee often amounts to tens of thousands of dollars that a buyer has to spend and never
*  gets back.
*  The second thing is you are paying interest on a mortgage when you buy a home.
*  And many people say, yes, but there's a tax deduction that reduces that interest.
*  And it's true, there is, but it only reduces that interest.
*  You're still paying the cost of interest that you never have to pay if you rent.
*  And it's a really significant amount of money.
*  Not only that, but in the first few years of paying a mortgage, the way mortgages are
*  structured, you pay almost entirely interest.
*  So what you really should think about is that in your first several years of living in a
*  house, you are going to pay many tens of thousands of dollars to a combination of real estate
*  agents and banks, almost none of which is actually home equity for you.
*  Right.
*  The case you're making is that you may in fact be throwing away significantly more money
*  than you would be if you rented during those years.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Okay.
*  That's meaningful.
*  What are the other two ways in which you end up kind of throwing money away even when you're
*  buying a house, not renting?
*  Things go wrong in houses all the time.
*  Sometimes it's little repairs, like maybe a toilet breaks and you have to spend several
*  hundred dollars on it.
*  Sometimes it's really big repairs that just completely sneak up on you, like your roof
*  needs to be repaired or else you're going to have rain coming in the roof that can be
*  thousands of dollars.
*  When you rent, you don't pay that.
*  When you own, you do pay that.
*  And over time, it ends up being a really significant amount of money.
*  When we created this rent versus buy calculator for the New York Times years ago, we made
*  specific factor, which was the amount of money a typical homeowner spends each year just
*  on repairs.
*  And what is that number?
*  For a typical homeowner, it's often 1% of the purchase price of the house.
*  So if you have a $500,000 home, it's often $5,000 a year when you add up everything.
*  And so that's the third thing.
*  Okay.
*  What's the fourth?
*  The fourth is when you buy a home, you make a down payment.
*  It's often about 20% of the house price.
*  So it's a significant amount of money.
*  Just to do the arithmetic here, a 20% down payment on a $500,000 home is $100,000.
*  On a million dollar home, it's $200,000.
*  It's an enormous amount of money.
*  If you rent a home, you don't stick that money underneath your mattress.
*  You can invest it.
*  And while all investments bring risk, over time, most investments do just fine.
*  They make a positive return.
*  And so the comparison when you buy a house should not be to zero.
*  It should be in part to what would happen to your down payment money if you invested
*  it in the stock market or in bonds or in a basic index fund that over time tends to grow.
*  And so people should think not only about these direct costs of homeownership, but of
*  the opportunity cost of not being able to invest your down payment in another way that
*  it could make a return.
*  Right, you're saying on top of all the costs associated with buying a house that may not
*  ever represent a real return on the use of that money, you have to tie up the biggest
*  chunk of cash you probably have in your life in a home when that money could be used in
*  a Fidelity or a Vanguard or a TIA account that pretty reliably will, unless it's a giant
*  stock market crash, yield returns and make you profits.
*  That's right.
*  And let's put a fine point on this.
*  Over time, the stock market has risen substantially faster than house prices.
*  That seems important.
*  It is important.
*  And it's a point that many people miss.
*  The stock market is not guaranteed to go up.
*  And I don't want to suggest it is.
*  But over history, the stock market has risen more quickly than housing prices have.
*  So David, you are somewhat successfully crumbling the myth that homeownership is so great, renting
*  is so problematic.
*  But I want to be very skeptical.
*  And here I have some ego, some skin in the game.
*  I am a homeowner and I'm a New Yorker.
*  And in a place like New York, you tend to think of housing as a long-term investment
*  and kind of, if we're being honest, a can't lose investment, right?
*  You buy a home in a place like New York or Boston or Washington or San Francisco.
*  And the argument has always been that prices creep up.
*  Maybe it's slowly, but by the time you're ready to sell, you're going to make some real
*  money.
*  And the long-term value of that investment is so meaningful that it tilts all the scales
*  away from renting toward owning.
*  So what would you say to that?
*  The first thing I would say is I'm old enough to remember the housing bubble.
*  It was less than 20 years ago.
*  Prices fell in essentially every market in the country, including New York, including
*  San Francisco, including all these markets.
*  Nationwide, as an average, prices peaked in 2006 and did not return to that peak until
*  2017.
*  And so prices really can fall in the housing market.
*  They fell quite rapidly in that post-2006 period.
*  And sure, then they started rising.
*  But if you bought in 2006, it took a really long time to get your money back.
*  So that's the first thing I would say.
*  Prices really can fall.
*  The second thing here is I think inflation plays a lot of tricks on our minds because
*  inflation can be really significant.
*  And so the idea that a house price goes up over time is both true and less important
*  than it sounds.
*  The price of almost everything goes up over time.
*  The price of lettuce at the grocery store goes up.
*  And we tend to miss this with housing because we buy a house and then often don't sell it
*  for many years.
*  And we think, oh my goodness, it went up so much in price.
*  But we get tricked into thinking it goes up a lot.
*  The thing I would compare it to is most items in our lives are like children that you live
*  with and they're growing every day.
*  And so you don't really notice it.
*  But a house is like that distant cousin that you see at a wedding once every seven or
*  ten years.
*  And they have soared.
*  You think, oh my goodness, she's so much taller than she used to be.
*  And she is, but so are all the other children who are her age.
*  And we shouldn't think that somehow she has some phenomenal qualities of growth that other
*  human beings do not have.
*  I never thought of my kids in those inflationary terms.
*  David, given all of this, I think we have to accept the strength of the argument you're
*  making here on behalf of renting.
*  But I know something about you that leads me to question everything that you're saying.
*  You own a home, true or false?
*  True.
*  You know me well, Michael.
*  I own a home.
*  Right.
*  So is this a case of, you know, do as I say, not as I do?
*  That's a fair question, but I don't think it is.
*  I would say there still are times when buying can make sense.
*  But the question for each person out there is, is this one of those times for you?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, help us understand why even in this moment, when renting clearly makes so much
*  sense, buying still might feel like the right decision.
*  I think you just used an important word there, Michael, which is feel.
*  I think often buying feels like the right decision to people, even when it's not.
*  And I'm going to use myself as an example here.
*  I'm a New York Times reporter who spent years writing about renting and buying, and specifically
*  spent years writing articles saying people should not feel bad about renting.
*  And about 15 years ago, when my wife and I were in our mid-30s, we looked around and
*  we said, we're in our mid-30s, we're married, we have kids, we were moving from New York
*  to Washington, D.C. for the New York Times.
*  And we really wanted to own.
*  We wanted to have that feeling of owning for the first time.
*  But we couldn't afford the house that we wanted to live in.
*  So we actually allowed that deep desire to own to guide us.
*  And we bought a perfectly nice house, but it wasn't a house that we wanted to live in
*  for a very long time.
*  And that was a mistake.
*  It was not a ruinous decision.
*  But in terms of the strict finances, we lived in that first house that we owned for four
*  years.
*  And if we had rented for those four years in the same neighborhood, it absolutely would
*  have been a better financial decision for us.
*  Because of all the fees you just talked about and the interest you were paying the banks,
*  basically it was a bit of a losing proposition for you, sounds like.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So I really get the idea that people feel this deep pull toward owning.
*  I felt it myself.
*  And I think the number one question that people should ask themselves when they're trying
*  to decide whether to rent or buy is how long am I going to live in this house?
*  And then how confident am I that I'm really going to live there that long?
*  And if the answer is only a few years, renting almost always makes sense for all of the reasons
*  that we've been talking about so far.
*  OK, so the flip side of that would seem to be if you know you're going to be in a place
*  for a long time, then buying makes more sense.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So one of the reasons is that a big cost of buying is that upfront realtors fee.
*  And so if you're buying a five hundred thousand dollar home and thirty thousand dollars of
*  it goes to realtors fees, but you're going to go live in that house for twenty years,
*  that's just not that big a deal.
*  If you're going to live in a house for only four years, the way my wife and I were back
*  when we first bought, it's actually a lot of money.
*  If we had instead taken the money we used on a down payment for that first house and
*  invested it in other ways, it would have kept growing and we wouldn't have had to pay all
*  those realtor fees and the mortgage interest and the repairs we put into that house.
*  And we actually would have had more money for a down payment several years later than
*  we did.
*  Right.
*  And I think you should be commended as a financial reporter for admitting to making financial
*  mistakes.
*  Thank you.
*  Everyone makes mistakes.
*  The only question is whether you admit them and learn from them.
*  Right.
*  And admit them to millions of people.
*  OK, so David, what are the other factors that might tip people into buying versus renting,
*  even right now when prices are high and interest rates are high?
*  Well one's a little technical, but stick with me here.
*  When you buy a house, you are buying it with leverage, as people say, because you're getting
*  you don't have to pay for the entire house.
*  Let's use an example here.
*  You buy a $500,000 house and you put down the $100,000 down payment.
*  And for the sake of this, let's just ignore all the fees and costs.
*  Right.
*  You have a $400,000 loan.
*  $400,000 loan.
*  Let's imagine a few years later you go to sell that house and its price has gone down
*  to $400,000.
*  You've lost all your money because your down payment was just $100,000.
*  But the flip side of that is that if the house price goes up to just $600,000, you've doubled
*  your money.
*  Right.
*  Because your down payment was just $100,000 and you pay off your mortgage and you get
*  $200,000.
*  Now, by now you know this.
*  You don't actually double your money because you spent a ton of it on fees and on interest
*  and on house repairs.
*  And you could have instead invested that money in the stock market.
*  So in that example, actually, there's a decent chance if you lived in that house for a few
*  years that buying was a bad decision.
*  The math holds no matter what, which is you're buying a house with leverage.
*  And so it is the case that since there are government subsidies for mortgages, so it's
*  easier to borrow money to buy a house than borrow money to invest in the stock market.
*  That leverage does tend to help people over time who buy homes.
*  Put very simply, when things go well, the fact that you're buying a house with other
*  people's money tends to make the good outcome even better.
*  Exactly.
*  And so far we've just been talking about finances, Michael, and life is about more than money.
*  And I actually think the biggest case for buying is not the financial case.
*  Owning a home feels really good.
*  You don't have to worry about things like the landlord raising the rent.
*  And it's your space when you own a home.
*  You can renovate the kitchen and make it the kitchen of your dreams.
*  You can paint every wall in the house.
*  Right.
*  Economists sometimes talk about the difference between investment and consumption.
*  And I don't think people should feel bad about the fact that spending money to buy a house
*  is a really good form of consumption in many cases.
*  Right.
*  It's not just an investment.
*  If it was just an investment, then owning a home would be like owning a stock.
*  And they're different.
*  They're really different.
*  I mean, if you own a stock for 20 years and you lost some money on it, there's really
*  no benefit.
*  If you own a home for 20 years and you raised your children there and you met friends that
*  you're going to have for your whole life, all that stuff matters more than whether you
*  made a little bit of money or lost a little bit of money on it.
*  Right.
*  Stocks don't create memories.
*  Not most of them.
*  No, exactly.
*  So here's a way I would think about it.
*  If you found the place you want to live for 15 or 20 years, in that case, it is often
*  the right decision to buy.
*  And speaking of living in a home for 15 or 20 years or even longer, there's another
*  point we haven't talked about, which is the reality that a home for many families is a
*  place where multiple generations end up living.
*  Parent buys, a child grows up in the house, raises their kids in the house, and that house
*  becomes a kind of intergenerational creator of wealth.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I'm curious when you think that the kind of market that favors home ownership might ever
*  return, when interest rates might fall, when prices might fall, so that people aren't feeling
*  so locked out of buying if they want to.
*  Yeah.
*  I can't predict the future, but I can offer people a benchmark to think about this so
*  they can figure out when might be a good time to buy.
*  There's this concept we've used in the times that I really like called the rent ratio,
*  which we've run by a lot of experts, and it's just a simple index, but what it tries to
*  do is capture the relative cost of buying and the relative cost of renting.
*  It's actually quite simple.
*  Take the price of a house that you're interested in buying and then find a somewhat similar
*  house to rent and calculate the annual price of renting that house.
*  For most houses, the obvious price is a monthly rent, so just multiply it by 12.
*  You've got the annual cost of renting and you've got the price of buying that home forever.
*  You divide the home price by the annual cost of renting.
*  So, that's like a divide the home price by the annual cost of renting.
*  Okay.
*  Exactly.
*  So, you've got, again, a $500,000 house you're buying and you've found a similar place to
*  rent that would have cost $25,000 to rent for one year.
*  You divide $500,000, the price of the home, by $25,000.
*  Okay.
*  I'm literally doing that with a calculator.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  So, what'd you get?
*  I got 20.
*  Yes.
*  20 is the rent ratio there.
*  When you get a rent ratio that high, it means that it's going to be very hard for you to
*  a decent return on buying a house in anything less than a decade or more.
*  I was interviewing Mark Zandi, who's an economist who's been looking at housing for many, many
*  years and he said, right now, with current interest rates, he thinks the break-even point
*  is about 18.
*  If you can find a rent ratio of 18 or lower, it will often make sense to buy.
*  Now, spoiler alert, you're not going to find a rent ratio of 18 in just about any housing
*  market in the country because housing is so expensive right now.
*  That's part of the reason why for so many people, it really does make sense to rent
*  right now.
*  Right.
*  But I think the service you have really done here, David, beyond telling us whether to
*  rent or buy, is you have effectively liberated, I suspect, a lot of us from this paradigm
*  where renting is somehow not enough and represents any kind of shortcoming.
*  It just feels like we need to let go of that.
*  Maybe we should have let go of it a long time ago and this housing market has really helped
*  us understand why it's okay to do that.
*  I think that's exactly right, Michael.
*  Don't beat yourself up if you're renting.
*  Don't think you're making a bad financial choice.
*  In many cases, you're making a really smart financial choice and you're not wasting tens
*  of thousands of dollars, particularly in a housing market like this.
*  The first thing I would say is you should feel fine about renting, particularly right
*  now.
*  Better than fine.
*  I think I would have rented for my entire 20s and 30s.
*  I think it would have been a better financial decision to do so.
*  It really wasn't until I was almost 40 that my wife and I found a house that we really
*  wanted to live in and could afford and thought we would be there for many years.
*  In fact, we have.
*  We've lived in that house for more than a decade.
*  It's where I'm sitting right now talking to you.
*  We love it.
*  Buying that house was the right decision.
*  I completely understand why most people want to own.
*  And just because you don't buy right now or don't buy for the next few years doesn't mean
*  that you're never going to own a home.
*  And in fact, one of the ways to take a step toward owning a home in the future is to avoid
*  making a bad financial decision in buying a house now and instead building up the down
*  payment so that in the future you can in fact be the homeowner that you want to be.
*  Well, David, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Israel has agreed to a plan to minimize civilian deaths when it's ceasefire with Hamas comes
*  to an end, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who pushed for the plan
*  during a trip to Israel.
*  We made clear the imperative that before any operations go forward in southern Gaza, that
*  there be a clear plan in place that puts a premium on protecting civilians.
*  And the Israeli government agreed with that approach.
*  During a news conference on Thursday, Blinken did not specify Israel's plan to protect
*  civilians, but said he had pushed Israel for safe zones for Palestinians to gather
*  in Gaza and had asked Israel to spare critical Gaza infrastructure such as hospitals.
*  There are concrete steps that we know and we heard can ensure to the best of anyone's
*  ability that that happens.
*  The ceasefire, which involved the release of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas and the
*  release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, has lasted for a week but is scheduled to
*  expire today.
