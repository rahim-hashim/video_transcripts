# The Lifesaving Power of … Paperwork?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBiYmGv8F8M)
*  Hi, my name is Janine Interlandi and I'm a staff writer for the New York Times Magazine.
*  Imagine that you're born in a country and you're a citizen of that country and you've
*  lived there your whole life, but you can't prove that you were born there.
*  You can't prove how old you are or who your family is because you don't have a record
*  of your birth.
*  You're essentially undocumented in your own country, which is another way of saying that
*  you statistically and bureaucratically do not exist.
*  So all the rights and protections and liberties of citizenship, you have no guarantee that
*  you're going to be able to access any of that.
*  It turns out this describes a startlingly high proportion of the world's population.
*  There's an estimated 2 billion people on the planet right now that do not have birth
*  certificates.
*  Not only that, roughly half of the 60 million deaths that occur each year are not actually
*  recorded in any meaningful way, meaning the death is either not logged anywhere at all
*  or if it is, the cause of death is not determined, which means we have no idea what killed the
*  person.
*  This kind of paperwork might seem like esoteric, bureaucratic stuff, but it lies at the root
*  of all kinds of global health policies and human rights protections.
*  It's boring, it's wonky, but it can also be a matter of life and death.
*  On a community level, it's difficult for officials to allocate resources if they don't know how
*  big their population is, because you don't know who's living, who's dying, what they're
*  dying of, or in what proportion.
*  And then on a global scale, how can we conquer hunger or malaria or tuberculosis if we don't
*  have baseline data on how prevalent these conditions are?
*  How can we possibly figure out whether any given initiative is working or not?
*  Without good birth and death counts, we're just flying blind.
*  When my editor and I first decided to pursue the story, there were several countries on
*  the table.
*  Bangladesh was one, Rwanda was another, but we settled on Colombia for a couple of reasons.
*  The first reason is that Colombia is a country of dichotomies.
*  In its two biggest cities, Bogota and Medellin, you have pretty good birth and death registration
*  actually about on par with what you would see in the United States or Europe.
*  But in the rural parts of the country, which geographically speaking is actually the vast
*  majority of the country, you have very poor registration.
*  The other reason we chose Colombia is that I was actually born there in Medellin, and
*  I myself do not have a birth certificate.
*  So I have some personal experience with the issue.
*  I was adopted.
*  My parents brought me, my twin brother, and my older sister here from Colombia as infants,
*  and they did not get us naturalized, which is a whole other story.
*  I only discovered this when I turned 16, and like any American kid, tried to get my learner's
*  permit so I could get a driver's license.
*  It turns out you need a birth certificate to do that.
*  And not having one created all sorts of problems that it took my siblings and I years to sort
*  through.
*  So that was one of the very first things that actually sparked my interest in this story.
*  This story is about the global quest to improve birth and death registrations.
*  But it's also about this one family in particular, the Nosquiu family.
*  They're pineapple farmers, they're part of the Nassau indigenous community, and they
*  live in a very remote part of southern Colombia.
*  Because they live in this rural place, their baby was born at home.
*  And because the baby was born at home, he didn't have a birth certificate.
*  Their story was really moving to me for reasons that I hope will be apparent.
*  So here's my article, The Life-Saving Power of Paperwork, read by Almarie Guerra de Wilson.
*  The roads surrounding the Jerusalén San Luis Alto Picurito Indigenous Reservation in Putomayo,
*  Colombia, are treacherous on a good day.
*  Made mostly of gravel and mud, they narrow to barely the width of a small truck in some
*  places.
*  And in others, especially after a storm, they yield almost completely to the many rivers
*  with which they intersect.
*  They also twist and turn and bump without stop.
*  So in the most difficult months of her pregnancy, when everything tasted like cardboard and
*  it hurt even to sit or stand, Marleny Mesa avoided traveling altogether.
*  This meant skipping checkups at the clinic in Villa Garzón, which could take two hours
*  or more to get to.
*  But Marleny wasn't overly worried.
*  A nurse had assured her early in her pregnancy that her blood work was good and that everything
*  looked fine.
*  As a midwife herself, Marleny knew that making the trip would be riskier than missing a few
*  doctor's visits.
*  But now, in the final days of her pregnancy, she could not shake the feeling that something
*  was wrong.
*  She could barely breathe, for one thing.
*  For another, her anxiety and physical discomfort were approaching what felt like an unbearable
*  peak.
*  Her husband, Andrés Nóscue, called for an ambulance.
*  Hours passed, and none came.
*  He tried to find a car to take her to the hospital.
*  He'd also summoned Marleny's sister, Omaida, a prophet of their church, to come pray over
*  her belly.
*  But that seemed to do the trick.
*  Marleny's breathing evened out, and a week or so later, she delivered a tiny, squirming
*  boy with jet black hair and soft, curious eyes.
*  The couple named him Eliad.
*  Marleny thought he was perfect.
*  But her mother, a retired midwife, insisted that the placenta contained a hint of trouble.
*  It was far too big, she said, and Eliad was too small,
*  probably because he did not have enough room in her womb to grow.
*  His grandmother thought he might need an incubator.
*  Marleny thought he was fine.
*  But when the baby was a few days old, she and
*  Andrés took him to Villagrson for a checkup, just to be safe.
*  This proved harder than they expected.
*  The baby could not be seen at the hospital there until he had a civil identification
*  or registration number, which he could not get without a birth certificate,
*  which the hospital could not provide, because the baby was born at home.
*  Go to the registrar's office, the nurses told Marleny and Andrés.
*  But the registrar's office only sent Andrés back to the hospital where a different
*  nurse told them to try the notary's office instead.
*  By then it was almost noon.
*  The only bus of the day would be heading back to San Luis soon.
*  If Andrés and his family missed it, they would have to cough up more money for
*  room and board in town than they normally spent in a week.
*  So they went home.
*  The couple returned a few days later, but
*  the registrar's instructions were different and more complicated this time.
*  They would need two witnesses from their reservation, he said, and
*  several documents, including one with the baby's blood type and
*  another showing the medical care Marleny received during her pregnancy.
*  In order to prove that he was born inside the nation's borders and
*  that he was, in fact, their child.
*  The man seemed suspicious, Andrés said, and
*  asked many questions that he did not ask the first time.
*  There was nothing we could do.
*  Andrés told me one sweltering July afternoon as we sat in the shade of
*  his family's covered wooden porch.
*  They didn't believe the child was ours, so we went home again.
*  The couple planned to return to Villa Garzon as soon as they were able to stay
*  overnight so they could sort everything out once and for all.
*  But before they got the chance, Eliad developed a terrifying rash
*  with blisters on his head and face and began gasping for breath.
*  The family returned to Villa Garzon for the third time.
*  Marleny waited at the hospital while Andrés went to the notary.
*  This time, he was in luck.
*  A clerk there put him in touch with Lady Rodriguez,
*  a community health worker who works with a program known as Columbia Rural Vital.
*  One of several initiatives begun by the nonprofits Vital Strategies and
*  Bloomberg Philanthropies as part of a broader effort to improve birth and
*  death registries around the world.
*  By the organization's estimate,
*  some two billion people do not have birth certificates.
*  And only half of the 60 million or so deaths that occur each year
*  are recorded in any meaningful way.
*  The consequences of this failure are manifold and frequently dire.
*  Families like the Nosquis struggle to access the rights and
*  benefits of citizenship.
*  Government officials struggle to allocate resources and
*  formulate evidence-based health policies.
*  And a roster of identity-based crimes,
*  from election chicanery to child trafficking, are allowed to proliferate.
*  The problem of inadequate registries is most pressing in the low-income
*  nations of Africa and Southeast Asia, but it is not confined to those regions.
*  In Colombia, birth and death registration is especially spotty in indigenous and
*  Afro-descendant communities, where the national government tends to have
*  little presence, and registrars and notaries tend to apply the rules arbitrarily.
*  Columbia Rural Vital was created to simplify and democratize this process.
*  Rodriguez, a petite woman in her mid-30s who exudes an earnest pluck,
*  rushed to the notary's office soon after the clerk called her.
*  She asked Andres a series of questions about Eliad, entered his answers into
*  an app on her tablet, and certified the baby's birth and
*  parentage all in less than an hour.
*  Andres would need to complete a few more forms, she explained.
*  But Eliad had a birth certificate now and could see the doctor right away.
*  Andres took the certificate to the hospital.
*  The news there was far less comforting.
*  Eliad had a serious bladder infection and several possible birth defects.
*  The child was very sick, the doctor told them.
*  The couple should have brought him in sooner.
*  The world's wealthiest nations are awash in so much personal data,
*  that data theft has become a lucrative business and its protection a common concern.
*  From such a vantage point, it can be difficult to even fathom the opposite.
*  A lack of any identifying information at all,
*  let alone grapple with its implications.
*  But the undercounting of human lives is pervasive, data scientists say.
*  The resulting ills are numerous and consequential.
*  And recent history is littered with missed opportunities to solve the problem.
*  More than two decades ago, 147 nations rallied around the Millennium Development Goals,
*  the United Nations bold new plan for halving extreme poverty,
*  curbing childhood mortality, and conquering infectious diseases like malaria and HIV.
*  The health goals became the subject of countless international summits and
*  steady news coverage, and the world's most important health goal was to
*  ultimately spurring billions of dollars in investment from the world's wealthiest
*  nations, including the United States.
*  But a fierce debate quickly ensued.
*  Critics said that health officials at the United Nations and
*  elsewhere had almost no idea what the baseline conditions were in
*  many of the countries they were trying to help.
*  They could not say whether maternal mortality was increasing or decreasing,
*  or how many people were being infected with malaria, or
*  how fast tuberculosis was spreading.
*  In a 2004 paper, the World Health Organization's former director of evidence,
*  Chris Murray, and other researchers described the agency's estimates as
*  serial guessing.
*  Without that baseline data, progress toward any given goal,
*  to have hunger, for example, could not be measured.
*  There were many barriers to obtaining those baselines, but
*  the underlying problem was clear.
*  Because many low and middle income nations did not have functioning systems for
*  civil registries and vital statistics, about one third of all births and
*  a vast majority of deaths were not being counted in the first place.
*  Rather than develop those systems, health officials had come to rely on a mess of
*  surveys, censuses, and computer models that provided only crude
*  estimates of specific illnesses.
*  Effective birth and
*  death registries would help paint a far more accurate picture, critics argued.
*  But the surveys and censuses were faster and cheaper.
*  And with a roster of disease specific programs now competing for
*  resources, whole system reforms took a backseat.
*  It's a bit of a catch 22, says Prabhat Jha,
*  a professor of global health at the University of Toronto.
*  When you don't have good data, you turn to clever mathematical models.
*  They can be really quite wrong at the country level, but global funders and
*  politicians think, oh, we've got data.
*  Which then undermines the case for investing in more robust fixes.
*  In 2015, the United Nations set out to correct this problem
*  with yet another bold initiative.
*  This one aimed at ensuring that all births and
*  at least 80% of deaths would be routinely registered by 2030.
*  But more than seven years in, that effort is falling far short of its goals.
*  It's probably the single most critical failure of development in the past 30 years,
*  says Philip Settle, a medical and demographic anthropologist
*  who directs the civil registration initiative at vital strategies.
*  Not only because of how pervasive or underappreciated the problem is,
*  but because of how broad its impacts are.
*  Bangladeshi widows can't secure land rights or
*  survivor benefits without the means to register their spouse's deaths.
*  Rwandan street children can't attend school or
*  access the legal economy because they lack valid birth certificates.
*  And young girls across Southeast Asia can't extract themselves from forced
*  marriages without a way to prove their own ages or identities.
*  It's disastrous, says Stephen McFeely,
*  director of data and analytics at the World Health Organization.
*  Especially when you consider this is a really basic fundamental metric.
*  These are the two bookends of life, and we still don't have a good handle on either.
*  The pandemic made these shortfalls difficult to ignore.
*  From the earliest days of the first outbreaks,
*  as scientists struggled to grasp how deadly the coronavirus actually was,
*  or to guess how long any given wave might last, elected officials and
*  their constituents found themselves transfixed by maps and
*  graphs and striking exponential growth curves.
*  But if those emblems of the crisis created a feeling of understanding and
*  control, the facts remained elusive.
*  As with the millennium development goals,
*  at least part of the problem came down to a question of baselines.
*  You can't contact trace people that you don't know exist in the first place,
*  McFeely says.
*  You can't allocate vaccines properly or
*  tell how severe a given variant is if you don't know how many people it's killing.
*  Three years into the pandemic, COVID's true death toll remains impossible
*  to determine.
*  In May 2022, the World Health Organization concluded that it was likely
*  2.5 times as high as previously reported, 15 million, as opposed to 6 million.
*  By then, scientists were estimating that India's death toll from COVID was
*  probably six times as high as officials there initially said.
*  A 2021 report in the journal eLife also noted large gaps between
*  the figures government officials gave and what impartial analysis suggested.
*  In Belarus, Egypt, Nicaragua, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and elsewhere.
*  Some of that undercounting was deliberate and political.
*  The lower the death toll in a territory,
*  the better any given leader's pandemic response looks.
*  But not all of it was.
*  Death counts have remained low throughout sub-Saharan Africa for
*  most of the pandemic.
*  But death registries are especially weak in that part of the world.
*  And scientists say it remains unclear whether those countries were truly spared,
*  or if hundreds of thousands of COVID deaths were simply never reported.
*  I think eventually we'll find out, says Chris Murray,
*  now the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and
*  Evaluation at the University of Washington School of Medicine.
*  But it is remarkable how much uncertainty there is on a subject that's actually quite important.
*  It's clear, meanwhile, that when it comes to fortifying our data systems,
*  time is not on our side.
*  As the pandemic wanes, a number of other pathogens,
*  Mpox, measles, influenza, are wreaking fresh havoc.
*  With the planet warming, scientists say that
*  scientists say that we may soon find ourselves confronting several pandemics at once.
*  The only way to protect ourselves from these assaults will be to protect everyone else,
*  says Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
*  Especially those who are most vulnerable or least able to protect themselves.
*  The first step to doing that, to understanding who they are,
*  how they live, and what they are most likely to die of, will be to count them.
*  Marlini comes from a long line of midwives and had already born four children herself.
*  But she could not remember ever taking an infant to a hospital.
*  She was bewildered when the doctors in Villa Garzon told her that Eliad needed to be transferred
*  to a bigger facility in Puerto Aziz, a city two hours in the opposite direction.
*  And she became angry when the nurses in Puerto Aziz took the baby from her arms and,
*  without preamble, whisked him off to intensive care.
*  How could it help to separate a newborn from his mother?
*  Why could she not go to the ICU with him?
*  One nurse suggested that she return to a reservation because the baby would be there for a while.
*  Another told her that she could come back during visiting hours to nurse him if she wanted.
*  The following morning, she says, she found Eliad in the ICU, cold and wet,
*  covered in vomit and turning purple.
*  He was wailing.
*  Marlini wanted to take him home immediately.
*  If he was going to die, she thought,
*  better it be there where she could care for him herself.
*  Eventually, a doctor explained to Marlini why the baby had to stay.
*  He needed an incubator and antibiotics and at least a few weeks to heal.
*  The couple spent those weeks in Puerto Aziz, staying with relatives and using the bulk of
*  their savings to cover personal expenses as well as the hospital fees for diapers and other supplies.
*  Marlini, who was allowed to see her baby only during visiting hours,
*  could not help thinking he might have been spared all the suffering
*  if the doctors in Villagarrson had not turned him away in his first few weeks of life.
*  The Nosque family's experience did not surprise Edna Margarita Valle,
*  the lead coordinator at Colombia's National Statistics Department, Dane.
*  Valle is based in Bogota, but spends the better part of her year visiting communities that can be
*  reached only by river or airplane. She has met people in their 60s and 70s who have never had
*  any legal identity. She has also encountered scores of families whose experiences mirror
*  those of the Nosque. When I visited her office in July, she showed me one video in which a family
*  in La Guajira, across the country from San Luis, described traveling four hours by motorcycle with
*  their newborn in tow, only to be sent away by the registrar. It's the norm, she said.
*  The registrars have been working in these places forever, and they treat it like their own store
*  or their own private business. Families are often forced to pay for their birth certificates,
*  a document that is really a basic human right.
*  National civil registries are relatively new in Colombia. For much of the country's long history,
*  births and deaths were logged primarily by the Catholic Church, and the best way to obtain a
*  birth certificate was to have a baby baptized. But in the early 1990s, a new constitution
*  strengthened the separation of church and state. A law guaranteeing health care to all citizens
*  created new incentives for parents to register their children with the national government,
*  and a new agency began collecting that data and producing statistics from it.
*  But if those advances improved the government's ability to count and analyze its population,
*  they also created a yawning disparity between wealthy urban centers like Bogotá and Medellin,
*  and the impoverished rural regions that claim most of the nation's physical space.
*  Nationally, we have about 85 to 90 percent coverage now. Victor Hugo Álvarez Castaño,
*  former director of epidemiology at Colombia's Ministry of Health, told me.
*  But that last 15 percent makes up the poorest, most disenfranchised segment of the population.
*  You're talking about five or six million people. And because they aren't registered,
*  it's as if they don't exist. As a result, health officials still struggle to identify and respond
*  to health crises in those communities. In the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia,
*  a recent whooping cough outbreak was allowed to fester for weeks.
*  In La Guajira, public health agencies are still trying to map a childhood malnutrition crisis
*  that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found amounted to a human rights violation on
*  the part of the Colombian government. And in Puto Mayo, where many births and deaths
*  still happen far from hospitals and clinics, families like the Nosquilas,
*  families like the Nosquis, are routinely thwarted by bureaucracies that they can neither grasp
*  nor navigate. In principle, at least, Colombia Rural Vitals' approach to this problem is simple.
*  When a baby is born, or someone dies outside a hospital, the people connected to that event—
*  family members, funeral directors, community leaders—send a text message to a toll-free number.
*  The text is routed through a telephone and computer network that enables health workers
*  like Lady Rodriguez to see it. An investigation is begun, the vital event is verified,
*  and a birth or death certificate is issued. But if those steps are clear, so are the hurdles.
*  Individuals and institutions must still be persuaded to report their births and deaths
*  in this way. And because many villages don't have reliable cell phone service,
*  it's tough to say what portion of sent texts reach the platform.
*  The program is operational in just 25 of the nation's 317 highly rural municipalities.
*  Proponents are eager to see it expand. But in the wake of COVID, with the economy convulsed
*  and resources thin, expansion has been difficult. Most rural hospitals don't have the resources to
*  hire and train sufficient staff members, and at those that do, officials don't always see the point.
*  Only seven of the 13 municipalities in Putumayo, where the Nosquist live, have bothered to join
*  the pilot project. We are waiting for the strategy to become a law, so that the municipalities are
*  obliged to have at least one person who is fully trained and devoted to this work.
*  Frankie Moreno, a doctor in the epidemiology department of Putumayo, told me.
*  In the meantime, he said, success hinges almost entirely on the tenacity of community health
*  workers like Rodriguez, who are underpaid and tend to work on contracts that are subject to
*  cancellation by municipal leaders. Despite those difficulties, Rodriguez, and others like her,
*  often do triple duty, promoting the program to the communities they work in, a task they refer to as
*  socializing the program, following up on the reports that make it to the platform,
*  and employing their own on-the-ground strategies to capture the births and deaths
*  that are still slipping through the cracks. The work can be both tedious and risky.
*  Armed groups control many of the territory's Rodriguez frequents, and the motorbike she relies
*  on to get her from one outlying village to the next is old and prone to breakdowns.
*  Still, she loves her job. We are uncounted, too, she told me as we drove through Putumayo.
*  We know what it is to be overlooked by our government, and it's our job to stop that from happening to others.
*  Counting initiatives can be a tough sell. Uncovering problems like preventable illnesses or
*  poor nutrition can increase the pressure on officials to address them.
*  And overcoming individual apathy can be difficult in places where the benefits of citizenship,
*  education, health care, social services, are paltry, and the barriers to civil registration are high.
*  In many low- and middle-income countries, a substantial portion of births and deaths
*  still occur away from institutional eyes. Families who want to register those events
*  must not only gather documents, a tall order for people who cannot read or write,
*  but also summon witnesses and often make arduous journeys to the nearest registrar.
*  A key to resolving these difficulties, says Anushka Mangaram, a former technical advisor
*  for Vital Strategies, is to take the registrar to the people. That's an easy enough proposition
*  when it comes to births. Parents who want health care or education for their children
*  have obvious incentives to welcome such intrusions. But when it comes to death,
*  the benefits can be harder to discern. And revisiting a painful loss often exacts a
*  heavy emotional toll. To encourage people to register the deaths of loved ones,
*  health workers use a technique called verbal autopsy, which is exactly what its name suggests.
*  A standardized interview with the family of the deceased, in which a set series of questions is
*  posed and the answers entered into an app on a tablet or cell phone. That information is then
*  analyzed by algorithms and health officials to determine the most likely cause of death.
*  Critics say that the algorithms are far from perfect, and that it's especially difficult
*  to distinguish among conditions with similar symptoms, like lung cancer and respiratory
*  infections. But proponents say that even with those shortcomings, verbal autopsies can still
*  give health officials a much clearer picture of where and how people are dying. For one thing,
*  they enable health workers to count more deaths. For another, they help standardize a process that
*  often gets short shrift. In many parts of the world, doctors aren't adequately trained to
*  assess the cause of death or to accurately fill out death certificates. In communities with
*  significant shortages of trained health professionals, these forms are often completed by people with no
*  medical experience at all. Verbal autopsies make it possible for those with even minimal training
*  to collect the necessary information. Early trials of the approach have been eye-opening.
*  In Sierra Leone, maternal mortality was found to be much lower than expected.
*  In Bangladesh, drowning was found to be a leading cause of death among children.
*  And construction site accidents were a more common killer of adults than previously realized.
*  In India, the Million Death Study, a seminal trial of verbal autopsies designed by JAA and
*  conducted in 1.3 million households beginning in 2001, upended the nation's understanding of
*  sickness and death. Malaria was far more common among adults than anticipated. HIV was rarer and
*  snake bites were claiming tens of thousands more lives than officials had assumed.
*  In Colombia, health officials have been promoting verbal autopsy as a means of shoring up death
*  registration in rural regions like Putumayo. In my second week there, I traveled to Orito,
*  another rural municipality just 100 miles or so from where the Nosques live, to observe these
*  efforts up close. I was planning to spend the day with Dora Urbano, then a nurse at Orito General
*  Hospital, who tracked and verified deaths for Colombia Rural Vital, the Vital Strategies Program.
*  A new armed group, which seemed to be an offshoot of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
*  FARC, had just blanketed the city with flyers claiming possession of the territory and issuing
*  several new restrictions, including a 5pm curfew. As we discussed whether to modify those plans,
*  we received news that a funeral director the team worked with had been shot and killed that morning.
*  The circumstances of his death were unclear. The only thing anyone could say for certain was that
*  he had been stopped at a checkpoint on his way to one of the remote villages. But Urbano's employers
*  decided that it was too risky for health workers to travel. The verbal autopsies would have to be
*  done at the hospital, or at some halfway point. Urbano, a 44-year-old single mother of two who
*  grew up in Orito and followed in her mother's footsteps by becoming a nurse at the local
*  hospital, remained calm in the face of these developments. As a young girl, she watched as
*  her own mother was summoned by armed men to tend to their wounded and, on at least one occasion,
*  to prepare a corpse for burial. In the year or so since Colombia Rural Vital introduced its initiative
*  in Orito, she had become a medical detective of sorts, traveling from village to village,
*  cultivating sources and ferreting out unreported deaths. At the time of my visit, she was keeping
*  tabs on several that had yet to be certified. They included a 14-year-old girl who either
*  hanged herself or was killed by her father and then hanged to make it look like a suicide,
*  a man who was crushed to death by a falling tree, and several grandparents whose existence may never
*  have been registered in any way, but whose deaths now needed to be counted. Our first case that
*  morning involved a man named Rodolfo, whose wife and daughter had recently died. His wife's death
*  had been registered, it occurred in the hospital, but his daughters had not because she died at home.
*  Rodolfo was obstinate when Urbano first contacted him. He saw no reason to discuss such a painful
*  event with strangers, he said. He would rather his family be left in peace. But Urbano met his
*  resistance with so much empathy and calm persistence that when the plan changed and he was asked to
*  travel to the hospital rather than receive her at his home, he went willingly. Now he was seated
*  across from her in an empty conference room. He stared into the middle distance as she explained
*  the verbal autopsy process and then began with her questions. Did the baby have sudden convulsive
*  seizures? No, he replied. Did she lose consciousness, have a stiff neck or get a faraway look?
*  No. Did she have any rash on her body? No. Did her stomach seem bigger than normal,
*  here, as if it was swollen? No. By now, Rodolfo's eyes were tearing.
*  He shifted in his seat and began tapping his left heel rapidly enough to make both knees shake.
*  He seemed poised to stand up and leave. Urbano had learned from experience when to offer condolences,
*  when to pat a shoulder or take a hand, and when to give a wider berth. She paused now,
*  tilted her head slightly and regarded her client with solemnity and warmth.
*  When his knees stopped shaking and he was able to meet her gaze, she resumed her questioning.
*  Fifteen or so minutes later, they were finished.
*  The Intensive Care Unit in Puerto Asís was like another world between life and death.
*  Eliad spent several weeks there before his bladder infection cleared. The doctors said he would need
*  to see several specialists. But it would take weeks to schedule those appointments, so in the
*  meantime, his parents were free to take him home. The Nascuejón, a spacious but only partially
*  enclosed wooden structure, lacked the hospital's amenities. Electricity was too erratic to power
*  a refrigerator. The rains and the humidity brought a dampness that was often impossible to escape.
*  But to Marleny's mind, the things that home could provide more than compensated for those deficits.
*  Quiet so that the baby could rest. The constant presence of loved ones and an abundance of plants
*  that would enable her to treat at least some of her son's ailments herself. Andrés wanted to make
*  several improvements to the house, but those plans were delayed, owing partly to the low price of
*  pineapples. He farmed them, and the market was saturated. Like most families on the reservation,
*  and some 40% of families in the country, the Nascues hovered near the World Bank's poverty line
*  of $8.60 per day for a family of four. In Putumayo, the surest way to rise above that line
*  was to switch from pineapples to coca. The Colombian and United States governments have
*  spent decades trying to disrupt that calculus. Their interventions include aerial fumigation
*  campaigns, the creation of a palm oil industry, and a steady persecution of farmers like the Nascues.
*  But a majority of the world's cocaine still comes from Colombia, and Putumayo remains one of the
*  nation's leading producers. The 2016 peace accord between FARC and the Colombian government
*  was supposed to curb the appeal of coca growing, in part by bringing the trappings of government,
*  not just roads and clinics, but plumbing and electricity, schools and shops, economic
*  opportunities, to departments like Putumayo. But progress has been glacial, and armed groups
*  still hold far greater sway over many communities than the national government.
*  Colombia is one of the most unequal nations in Latin America, a fact that neither the ceasefire
*  nor the economic gains of recent decades have done much to alter. And as a result of the pandemic,
*  indigenous communities, like the Inasa people to which Marleni and Andrés belong,
*  have only fallen further behind. Nowhere are the disparities more apparent than in health care.
*  Technically, it has long been available to all, thanks to the universal health care law passed
*  when Andrés and Marleni were children. But in practice, the barriers to access are often
*  insurmountable. A lack of reliable transportation, clinics that are understaffed and often difficult
*  to reach. Doctors and nurses who can be hostile to the black and indigenous communities they serve,
*  and a bureaucratic thicket of referrals and authorizations that exacerbates all those things.
*  Eliade spent nearly a month in intensive care in Puerto Aziz, but it was not until his follow-up
*  appointments, at three different hospitals in three different cities, that the nature and extent
*  of his condition became clear. Pasto was the most difficult of those cities to get to.
*  The family had to travel from San Luis to Villa Garzón, stay overnight, and then take a six-hour
*  bus ride to Pasto early the next morning. The distance between Villa Garzón and Pasto is less
*  than 100 miles, but a stretch of road linking the two cities is widely regarded as the worst
*  in all of Colombia. Known as the Trampoline of Death, and said to be teeming with ghosts,
*  it snakes along hairpin-thin mountain ridges that give way to 100-foot drops on one side
*  and steep mudslide-prone cliffs on the other. Marleni was already uncomfortable, having recently
*  injured her hip in a fall, but Eliade was not a fussy baby. He slept peacefully in Andrés's arms
*  for most of the ride. The doctor in Pasto was kind. She saw Eliade right away and made careful study
*  of the notes Marleni brought from the other hospitals. But she was also firm. The baby had
*  several serious birth defects, including a heart murmur for which she would need surgery and
*  pulmonary stenosis, which meant that a valve connecting his heart to his lungs was narrowing
*  as he grew. He would have to grow a little more before any operations could be performed,
*  and in the meantime, Marleni and Andrés would have to be vigilant about doctor's appointments
*  and follow-up care. They would also have to keep their hopes in check. Some children, like their
*  son, recovered with surgery and survived to adulthood, but many did not. Back home, Eliade
*  gave no sign that he sensed these long odds. He suckled readily, smiled and cooed, charmed his
*  mother. Marleni took scores of pictures and videos of him on her cell phone, hushing Andrés whenever
*  he reminded her to conserve battery power for emergencies. Their son was feisty and spirited,
*  she thought, and he seemed to be getting stronger. As they waited for him to grow into his first
*  operation, she could not help but nurture a small blossom of hope. For decades, the burden of fixing
*  birth and death registries, of counting the uncounted, has rested mostly on health officials.
*  When MacFeeley joined the World Health Organization in 2021, he was surprised to discover how
*  intractable the problem seemed. I wrote a blog post about it and people were reaching out saying,
*  oh, we made the same arguments 30 years ago, he told me recently. I'm like, how the hell is this
*  still a problem in this day and age? But in the years since, he has come to see the challenge
*  of accurate birth and death counts as much bigger than the health ministries charged with addressing
*  them. It's not just that health officials don't control the registries or the purse strings.
*  It's that the registries implicate and are implicated in every aspect of the state,
*  public health, local governance, basic human rights. MacFeeley has come to think of the issue
*  as a tragedy of the commons. Birth and death counts are like the environment or the ocean,
*  he says, because nobody quite owns them. No one takes responsibility for fixing them.
*  Progress is nonetheless being made. In Rwanda, officials have amended laws to make registration
*  easier and have vastly expanded the number of registration offices throughout the country.
*  In Bangladesh, the national government has created a cabinet-level office devoted to building a
*  modern civil registration and vital statistics program. And in Colombia, a new central computerized
*  system will soon make it far easier to turn vital event data into the kind of statistics that can
*  be used to guide health policy. Verbal autopsy initiatives are taking root, and mobile technology
*  is being employed in all those countries and elsewhere. It's not a pipe dream anymore to say
*  that we can count all births and deaths everywhere, says Settle, the vital strategies anthropologist.
*  We have the technology to do that. It doesn't even necessarily need to be super expensive.
*  But for the scores of individual pilot programs that are emerging now to morph into strong national
*  institutions, leaders in every sphere of government will have to step up. We have to stop thinking of
*  this as a health problem and start looking at it as a whole-of-government issue, McFeely says.
*  Health ministries will not be enough. Heads of state will have to get involved, and they will
*  have to do more than just establish or strengthen registries. They will have to scale up social
*  services in ways that pay more than lip service to the marginalized. Citizenship is only as valuable
*  as the rights and protections it provides, and the problem of birth and death registration
*  is inextricably bound to the problem of social safety nets. In this regard, the NOSCUE story
*  offers a parable of sorts. In principle, at least, every Colombian citizen has access to the nation's
*  health care system. But without reliable roads or accessible clinics, Marlene was forced to carry
*  and deliver her baby without the benefits of that resource. As a result, her enlarged placenta went
*  undiagnosed, and her baby was caught in a vicious cycle, born at home because his parents could not
*  access the health care system, and then unable to access the health care system because he was born
*  at home. As they waited to see how he would fare, Eliade's family did all they could to spoil him.
*  Whenever he woke from a nap or began cooing, they would stop what they were doing and flock to him.
*  Andres encouraged Marlene to set aside her other responsibilities and spend every moment she could
*  with the baby, partly to make sure he was okay, but also to savor him as much as possible.
*  So when he began spitting up excessively one Friday, nearly two weeks after their visit to
*  the pasto, his parents noticed immediately. He didn't have a fever or other symptoms,
*  but he could not seem to keep anything down. Marlene gathered plants and prepared an anti-nausea
*  brew, which appeared to settle his stomach. But the couple agreed that if the sickness returned,
*  they would take him to the hospital. The weekend passed, and Eliade once again seemed to push
*  through his difficulties. By Saturday, he was cooing and smiling again, well enough to join
*  the family at church that evening. But on Sunday, when Marlene woke, he was short of breath.
*  We should leave, she said, waking Andres. It was still dark out. The bus would not come for hours.
*  Andres called for an ambulance without much hope, and then went out to look for transportation
*  while Marlene alternated between readying Eliade for the hospital and trying to soothe him as best
*  she could. She yelled for her father to bring a blanket. One does not know what to do in that
*  desperation, she told me later. But before she could wrap him up, the baby fell asleep.
*  And then, after a few short breaths, his heart stopped beating.
*  His funeral was a blur. Marlene remembers only that the viewing and mass took a full day,
*  and that their church honored him with a formal street procession en route to the graveyard.
*  She remembers leaving home with the baby in her arms and returning several hours later,
*  completely empty. Weeks later, when spring had yielded to summer and she and Andres had
*  settled deep into their grief, Rodriguez, the health worker, and several nurses visited the
*  family to perform a verbal autopsy and provide a death certificate. They spent a full hour
*  questioning Marlene and Andres about Eliade's illness and the circumstances of his death.
*  The information they collected would be fed into a computer and sent to a national repository,
*  where it would join a mountain of similar data. That data would be churned into statistics on who
*  was dying in Colombia and how, and eventually, those statistics would be used to shape policies
*  and guide resources. But nothing in that long process would alter the basic facts.
*  Eliade Nosquemesa lived for 87 days and died in the same house where he was born.
*  His life was infinitesimally short and packed with far more than its share of suffering.
*  But he had still known joy. He had known his family's love, and his time here had mattered to
*  them. Marlene and Andres took some comfort in knowing that, at the very least, his life had now
*  been counted.
