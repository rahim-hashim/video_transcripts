# Biden Puts Netanyahu On the Spot
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1VFuu2gC6I)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Before we start today, we wanted to invite you to something really special.
*  The legendary Tribeca Festival is starting a brand new annual gala to celebrate excellence
*  in audio, and for this, the inaugural year, they've chosen to celebrate the daily.
*  We know that you, our incredible audience, are all over the world, but we'd like you
*  to join us.
*  The gala is in New York on June 9th at 5pm.
*  You can get all the details and buy tickets at tribecafilm.com slash the daily.
*  That's tribecafilm.com slash the daily.
*  I'm going to be there, so is Sabrina, along with a bunch of us from the show.
*  Mo Rocca is going to host it.
*  So if you're in the area or visiting, we'd love to see you there.
*  Okay, on with today's show.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is the Daily.
*  In an unexpected speech last week, President Biden revealed the details of a secret proposal
*  intended to end the war in Gaza.
*  Most surprising was where that proposal had come from.
*  Today, my colleague, Isabel Kirchner, explains Biden's gambit and the difficult choice it
*  presents for Israel's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  It's Wednesday, June 5th.
*  Isabel, tell us about this speech from President Biden last Friday at the White House.
*  So last Friday, President Biden made a speech, and it came at a pivotal moment in the war
*  because for weeks beforehand, the whole world had been focused on Israel's long-delayed
*  invasion of the city of Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza Strip, and also the city
*  that about a million displaced Palestinians had fled to, to find refuge from fighting
*  in other areas of the Gaza Strip.
*  So understandably, there was huge concern internationally, and particularly a lot of
*  pressure coming from the White House for Israel not to go into Rafah.
*  It was just considered way too risky.
*  But for the Israelis, you know, they were saying the last battalions of Hamas are there,
*  many hostages are there, and without taking control of that area, the Israelis felt they
*  wouldn't have accomplished anything.
*  So in the end, they did begin to move into the eastern part of Rafah.
*  Then as the Israelis were operating in eastern Rafah with their tanks and ground troops,
*  the Israelis on May the 26th carried out a strike, an air strike.
*  This was an attack meant to target two Hamas operatives, and they did in fact strike those
*  two operatives and kill them with what they said were the smallest missiles that their
*  jets could carry.
*  Unfortunately, that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire, because where
*  the area the strike took place in is right by a camp of makeshift shacks and tents where
*  hundreds or thousands of Palestinians were sheltering.
*  This fire ripped through the tents and ended up killing 45 civilians, according to the
*  Garzine Health authorities.
*  And it was exactly the kind of disaster that everybody had feared if Israel were to operate
*  in this crowded southern dusty border town.
*  Which presumably put a lot more pressure on the Biden White House to do something about
*  this war.
*  That's right.
*  Now, we know that the White House, the Biden administration would very much like to see
*  this war come to an end as soon as possible.
*  And then on Friday, President Biden gives a speech.
*  And surprisingly, this speech, when it turns to the Israel-Hamas war, was not about Rafah.
*  In fact, it was something totally different and much bigger.
*  Israel has now offered, Israel has offered a conference of new proposals.
*  It's a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages.
*  What President Biden described as the outline of an Israeli proposal for a ceasefire, truce
*  and hostage release deal with Hamas that would end the war.
*  This proposal has been transmitted by Qatar to Hamas.
*  Today, I want to lay out its terms for the American citizens and for the world.
*  And Isabel, what did he mean exactly by the Israeli proposal?
*  Well, there's been a lot of smoke and mirrors around this whole process of talks and negotiations
*  between Israel and Hamas.
*  And in fact, the last time we saw a negotiation actually result in a temporary ceasefire and
*  a partial hostage release was at the end of last November.
*  But in fact, there had been this on again, off again attempt at getting negotiations
*  back on track over the last few weeks.
*  And it soon came to light that this was the latest Israeli proposal that was apparently
*  presented.
*  And this proposal, it turns out, was unanimously approved as a basis for the negotiation by
*  Israel's war cabinet.
*  And here is an American president spelling out this previously undisclosed Israeli position
*  on television.
*  Absolutely.
*  And the Israeli public knew nothing about this.
*  So what does Biden actually say?
*  What does he say is in this proposal?
*  Okay, well, what he says.
*  This new proposal has three phases.
*  Three.
*  He presents it as a deal in three phases, which is generally in line with all the previous
*  plans of the last few months.
*  And the first phase would involve a six-week temporary ceasefire, during which a certain
*  number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, the most vulnerable ones,
*  there are American hostages who would be released at this stage, and we want them home,
*  would be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
*  And Israeli forces would be withdrawing from population centers within the Gaza Strip,
*  with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day.
*  Humanitarian aid would be flowing at a much greater level and generally the beginning of a change
*  in atmosphere and climate.
*  So this seems in some ways like the temporary ceasefire in November, right?
*  Women and children, vulnerable hostages, a cease in hostilities for six weeks.
*  What about phase two?
*  Well, here we get to the crucial part, because during phase one, the sides are supposed to
*  start negotiating phase two.
*  Now, I'll be straight with you.
*  There are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two.
*  And phase two is supposed to culminate in all remaining living hostages released and
*  exchanged again for many more Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
*  This would involve also the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip.
*  And in his speech, President Biden does say that as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments,
*  the temporary ceasefire would become, in the words of the Israeli proposal,
*  the cessation of hostilities permanently, essentially meaning the end of the war.
*  So Biden is actually talking about the end of the war.
*  Like he's saying that out loud, which is not something we've been hearing from Israel at all,
*  at least publicly.
*  On the contrary, in fact, our colleagues wrote a story at the end of last week when one senior
*  Israeli official said the war would last until at least the end of the year.
*  So this is something very new.
*  Absolutely.
*  And then we get to phase three, because there's a third phase to this plan.
*  And that is moving ahead already to the day after the war,
*  which has been kept very vague by the Israelis up to now.
*  And the phase that President Biden outlined was essentially just for a major
*  reconstruction plan for Gaza.
*  That's the offer that's now on the table.
*  And what we've been asking for is what we need.
*  So the president is saying that this is a deal that should be accepted,
*  that meets the requirements of both sides, that can point to a path forward.
*  And he makes a couple of points to bolster that.
*  The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to
*  their own security because they've devastated Hamas forces.
*  One of which is that in his view, Hamas has already been sufficiently degraded and
*  devastated to the point where, as President Biden puts it, Hamas is no longer capable
*  of carrying out another October the 7th.
*  In other words, that goal of total victory that Netanyahu talks about,
*  Biden is actually saying they've accomplished it.
*  The Israelis have accomplished it.
*  Not really, actually.
*  He takes on Netanyahu on the total victory slogan.
*  Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring Israel,
*  will not bring down, bogged out, will only bog down Israel and Gaza,
*  draining the economic, military, and human resources,
*  and furthering Israel's isolation in the world.
*  And says that total victory is a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal
*  that would basically mean indefinite war.
*  Because what does total victory mean?
*  You can't kill every last Hamas operative.
*  And even if you did, presumably there would be many more Palestinians
*  who would come to replace them.
*  And in a way, he's using this speech to go over the head of Netanyahu
*  and go straight to the Israeli people and present them with these terms,
*  to in a way corner Netanyahu, but also to put down the gauntlet to Hamas
*  and say, here are the terms.
*  They sound very like the terms Hamas was asking for.
*  And putting Hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table,
*  even though Israel is still fighting in Rafah.
*  It's time to begin this new stage.
*  For the hostages to come home, for Israel to be secure,
*  for the suffering to stop.
*  It's time for this war to end.
*  For the day after to begin.
*  Thank you very much.
*  So Biden is essentially saying here, listen, Israel, you have won the war effectively.
*  Like Hamas is degraded.
*  Now it's time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have designed.
*  What was the reaction inside Israel?
*  The initial reaction, it took a while to come because President Biden made his speech
*  and it landed at about 830 in the evening on Friday, Israel time.
*  This is the time where many, many families are sitting around their Sabbath dinner table,
*  as I was with my family and friends, not watching the news,
*  not looking at phones for the most part.
*  Observant Jews have actually switched off for the Sabbath
*  and aren't going to hear any news until Saturday night.
*  And as the news did begin to trickle out, it really shook Israel up.
*  And this leaves Netanyahu in a great bind because for months he's really been playing for time
*  and juggling competing interests and really not having to make a decision
*  one way or the other on what comes next.
*  We've been hearing that Rafah is really the last stronghold of Hamas
*  and this is something the military has to do.
*  But after that, there was just a kind of void
*  and no news on the hostages or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon.
*  And so when this speech was made, suddenly it shook up everything.
*  And Netanyahu is suddenly facing a very crucial choice.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Isabel, you said that this is a very important moment for Netanyahu,
*  that now he really is facing a choice.
*  What does he do? What does he come out and say?
*  So his office actually put out a statement.
*  And his first response was that Israel is sticking to its objectives of
*  the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities.
*  And he said the actual proposal put forward by Israel
*  would allow Israel to uphold these principles.
*  Now, this was a slightly ambiguous response that you could pass in different ways.
*  He wasn't exactly denying that this was an Israeli proposal.
*  And indeed, we quickly learned that, in fact, Israel's war cabinet
*  had unanimously voted on the general outlines of what President Biden had presented.
*  He wasn't denying it.
*  But the one thing missing from that statement was this declaration
*  we'd been hearing for months on end that the war wouldn't end
*  until there was total victory. That had gone.
*  So total victory had gone, which is a difference,
*  which means potentially the war goals have shifted a little bit.
*  Well, the way he articulated it is talking about the degradation
*  or dismantling of Hamas's capabilities, as opposed to talking about
*  the total elimination of Hamas as a movement.
*  And then he followed up.
*  His office put out another statement on Saturday, also still during the Sabbath,
*  which was a little stronger.
*  He said under the proposal, Israel would insist on its conditions being met,
*  these same war objectives, before a permanent ceasefire is put in place.
*  And that any suggestion that Israel would agree to that permanent ceasefire
*  before the conditions are met would be a non-starter.
*  But again, it was kind of conditional and could be interpreted in different ways.
*  At what point does one declare that the capabilities have been dismantled
*  or sufficiently degraded? So it left a lot of room for maneuver.
*  And so what is Netanyahu up to here, Isabel?
*  I think he's trying to balance all these competing sides.
*  He seems to be trying not to torpedo the chances of this deal,
*  but at the same time to be able to hang on politically when he has a very serious
*  challenge looming within his government should this deal go ahead.
*  So tell me about that challenge.
*  Israel's government is formed of a coalition of parties.
*  Netanyahu's Likud is the main party, but it totally relies for its majority in Parliament
*  on its partners in the coalition. And they include two ultra-orthodox parties
*  and two far-right parties. And the far-right parties have both come out explicitly saying
*  that should this deal, as outlined by President Biden, go ahead, they will not be party to it.
*  So Netanyahu faces this real political danger on his right.
*  That's right. So there are the leaders of these two right-wing parties who he relies on for his
*  coalition government. He relies on them for his majority in Parliament.
*  And the leaders of those parties are Itamar Benkvir, who's the national security minister,
*  and Bitzalel Smotrich, who is currently the finance minister.
*  Now, neither of these parties nor their leaders are sitting in the much more
*  tight and small war cabinet that actually oversees and directs and makes the decisions
*  on the course of the war in Gaza. They were seen as way too extreme to be part of that forum.
*  That forum is much more reflective of the national consensus.
*  But these parties are part of the broader government. And they have threatened not only
*  to oppose the deal, as outlined by President Biden, should it go ahead, but they have actually vowed
*  if it does go ahead, they would withdraw their support to Netanyahu and bring his government
*  down. And if his government were to collapse as a result, he would then be facing a new election.
*  Now, he has been trying to stave off the end of the war and the prospect of new elections
*  ever since October the 7th, because then he's in danger of facing that public reckoning
*  for the perceived failures, the government's policy failures, the military's failures,
*  the intelligence failures leading up to the Hamas-led attack of October the 7th.
*  But we really might be getting to crunch time when it comes to his political lifeline here.
*  So this is a pretty dramatic moment for Netanyahu then, right? I mean, he's under tremendous pressure
*  from Biden, his biggest ally. Biden's basically asking him to choose between this deal, which
*  means the end of the war, something his coalition partners, these hard right guys, really don't want,
*  and his own power, essentially, right? Staying alive politically or the end of the war and the
*  hostages coming home. That is a very stark choice. Absolutely. And then there are other choices that
*  he has to weigh because Israel has been increasingly isolated and under international
*  censure for his prosecution of the war in Gaza. Netanyahu himself is facing the prospect of
*  possible arrest warrants being put out against him from the International Criminal Court in the Hague.
*  Israel is in the dock on a genocide case in the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
*  So should he go ahead with this deal, he has been offered sweeteners like an invitation
*  to address Congress. And this would, in a way, be a way of bringing him back into the fold.
*  So Isabel, say Netanyahu approves this proposal, how likely is it that the right wing,
*  you know, Smotrich and Ben-Gavir actually do leave the government? I mean, they would be giving up
*  power too, no? They would. And if we look at all the opinion polls being done in Israel in the
*  last few months, but Salel Smotrich and his religious Zionism party, for one, would barely
*  scrape back into parliament in another election. And therefore there's a lot at stake for him too.
*  And for Itamar Ben-Gavir, because if the next government that's formed is not going to be a
*  right wing and far right government, he would find himself out of power too. But Isabel, let's
*  say they do leave. What happens in that scenario? Well, the assumption is that the government would
*  collapse, it would lose its majority. And naturally, the Knesset would vote to dissolve itself and set
*  a date for a new election, which would have to come within five months. And during that period,
*  this government would turn into a caretaker government. Now, usually a caretaker government
*  that's a transitional one in that period before elections isn't supposed to make dramatic
*  decisions for the country. But you know, being a caretaker government during wartime, this puts
*  Israel in uncharted political territory. Then theoretically, if we were to ask, could such a
*  government even approve a deal once it had been negotiated, even without the support of those far
*  right parties? Apparently, there would still be enough in favor to see it through. Interesting. So
*  it seems like there are a lot of possibilities for how this could go. But it does in a way rely
*  on Netanyahu deciding what Israel's course will be. And it seems like he probably needs to land on
*  one of these options. What do you think he's going to do? Well, it might not end up being black and
*  white, take the deal or not take the deal, we might end up seeing something in between. Because
*  you know, I think Netanyahu, who is facing huge public pressure to bring back those hostages who
*  still are alive, would definitely want to move ahead with at least that first part of the deal
*  that would see a six week temporary ceasefire in return for the most vulnerable hostages.
*  And then you get into the much trickier part of that negotiation for the next stage,
*  which would involve essentially ending the war. And it could be that, you know, we might see
*  Netanyahu wanting to proceed with this deal, but only partially and then get to a point where
*  it can't go further. And Netanyahu is probably very keenly aware of the American political
*  timetable. There are skeptics here who say that by Labor Day, all the American attention is going
*  to be focused on America's own internal politics running up to the November elections. And that
*  Netanyahu basically just has to survive another 90 days to get to that point, at which point
*  the pressure subsides. So this is a scenario in which he just basically runs out the clock,
*  he keeps on that tightrope. That's a possibility, absolutely. And one that he would be very adept
*  at doing if the past is anything to go by. Okay, so there are a number of ways Netanyahu could
*  actually handle this. How should we think about what Biden has really accomplished here?
*  Well, I think it's hard to say that one speech is going to change the course or the outcome
*  of this war. But it certainly has crystallized the issues and brought them out into the light
*  after months and months of murkiness that Netanyahu was able to, in a way, hide behind
*  and operate within. And I think now he's in the spotlight. And assuming that Hamas is willing to
*  accept and go along with this negotiation for this proposal. The Israeli public's expectations
*  have certainly been risen now toward a deal. And all eyes are now on Netanyahu to see which way
*  he will go. Isabel, thank you. Thank you so much.
*  In an interview with Time magazine published on Tuesday, Biden was asked whether Netanyahu
*  was prolonging the war in Gaza in an effort to hold onto office. Biden said,
*  there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in Arizona
*  voted to put a ballot measure before voters in November that would make unlawfully crossing
*  the border from Mexico a crime in the state. The move would put the border crisis directly onto
*  the ballot in a key swing state, potentially firing up anti-immigration conservative voters.
*  It is similar to a law passed in Texas earlier this year, currently held up in court after it
*  was challenged by the Biden administration. And the results of a major election in India have
*  been tallied and they are deeply disappointing for India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. Modi
*  appeared to have secured a third consecutive term in office. However, his BJP party did not
*  deliver the landslide victory it had promised and even lost its majority in parliament. Now Modi
*  and the BJP must come to an agreement with other parties in order to form a coalition government
*  in India's parliamentary system. Today's episode was produced by Will Reed,
*  Eric Krupke and Sydney Harper. It was edited by Brendan Klingenberg and Michael Benoit,
*  contains original music by Marian Lozano, Diane Wong, Dan Powell and Roman Mimisto,
*  and was engineered by Chris Wood. Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the daily. I'm Sabrina Tavernisi. See you tomorrow.
