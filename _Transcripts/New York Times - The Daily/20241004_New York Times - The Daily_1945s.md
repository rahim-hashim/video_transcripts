# Four Weeks to Go
**New York Times - The Daily:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  Voting is officially underway in Minnesota, Virginia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=5.0600000000000005s)]
*  There are just four weeks left until Election Day, and polls show that the race between [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=8.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is the closest in a generation. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=12.96s)]
*  It is so good to be back in Wisconsin. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=17.12s)]
*  Michigan we're going to bring back your car industry. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=21.84s)]
*  So I gathered three of my colleagues who are covering the campaign, Shane Goldmacher, Maggie [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=25.64s)]
*  Haberman and Nate Cohn, to make sense of the major events of the past week that could change [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=30.64s)]
*  that math. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=36.72s)]
*  Thousands of dock workers are on strike. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=37.72s)]
*  Israeli missiles striking near the heart of Beirut. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=39.84s)]
*  Ever-before-seen evidence in special prosecutor Jack Smith's election case against former [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  President Donald Trump. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  We're going to explore the last minute strategies that both campaigns are hoping might tip the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=49.64s)]
*  scales. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=55.56s)]
*  It's Friday, October 4th. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=59.44s)]
*  So welcome back to the three of you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=65.44s)]
*  The same cast as our last roundtable, which as you remember was the first historic roundtable [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=67.76s)]
*  inaugural. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=74.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=75.32s)]
*  So this is the second historical unprecedented inaugural. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=76.32s)]
*  Shane Goldmacher, Nate Cohn, Maggie Haberman. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=80.48s)]
*  Appreciate you guys being here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=83.76s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=84.76s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=85.76s)]
*  So let's jump in. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=86.76s)]
*  This has been a very eventful week. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=87.76s)]
*  We have a widening war in the Middle East. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=90.72s)]
*  We have a strike by longshoremen threatening the supply chain up and down the eastern seaboard. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=93.7s)]
*  Finally, we have a court filing from the special counsel Jack Smith that might be our first [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=99.76s)]
*  true October surprise. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=106.04s)]
*  So where do you want to start? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=108.68s)]
*  I think of the various things that you just described, the longshoremen strike. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  That's one that actually impacts people's lives, that impacts their daily existence. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=114.06s)]
*  This involves supply chain. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  It involves working people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=119.74000000000001s)]
*  The fight over working class voters is key for this race right now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=121.58000000000001s)]
*  So if everything we've just said, I think that's high up on the list. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  Well, just explain why this strike matters and how both campaigns are or aren't seizing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=129.94s)]
*  an opportunity with it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=134.52s)]
*  We saw what supply chains having trouble did for the economy before. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=137.0s)]
*  And I think for Harris, it's actually just a reminder of a big vulnerability she has, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=140.76s)]
*  which is she's tied to the current administration. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=145.08s)]
*  You look at her candidacy and she is trying to ride above the fray. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=147.8s)]
*  She is hope. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=151.2s)]
*  She is joy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=152.2s)]
*  She is the future. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=153.2s)]
*  And this is very much the present. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=154.2s)]
*  This is a problem. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=156.1s)]
*  This is an issue that has not been solved by Joe Biden. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=157.1s)]
*  And so in that way, it just pulls her back into the fray and doesn't let her ride above [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=160.78s)]
*  the clouds. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=165.72s)]
*  And it's worth remembering that the promise of the Biden administration was we were going [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=167.44s)]
*  to get a return to normalcy, that once the pandemic was over, we would all go back to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  our pre-pandemic, pre-Trump lives and forget about politics. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  And the Biden administration hasn't made good on that promise. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=179.3s)]
*  All this adds up to a sense that America isn't necessarily under competent leadership. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=181.88s)]
*  Maybe we should be going in a different direction. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=188.36s)]
*  And I think that the specifics of it are undoubtedly important, especially if they end up affecting [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=190.8s)]
*  the economy and people's lives. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  But more chaos in the news, I think, is just good news for Trump. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=196.76s)]
*  So at a very basic level, this is a problem primarily for Vice President Harris because [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=200.76s)]
*  it kind of reattaches her to a not especially popular incumbent president when she very [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=204.82s)]
*  much wants to be liberated from transcending the very idea of Joe Biden and his presidency. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I would lump them all together as Nate just did. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=215.84s)]
*  It's not just the longshoreman strike. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=217.88s)]
*  It's all of these things adding up to the sense that things aren't home and stable. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=219.48s)]
*  And this is in fact something that Trump himself is saying on the campaign trail. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=225.56s)]
*  And it's something we saw at the debate this week between the two vice presidential candidates. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=229.04s)]
*  I want to know why neither campaign so far has used and used as a tricky word because [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  it sounds so callous, but sees the opportunity to portray a strike by working class people. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=240.64s)]
*  And made this about what is wrong with America, what is perhaps wrong with income inequality [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=250.08s)]
*  and champion the workers on strike and not necessarily just treat it like a nuisance, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=255.28s)]
*  something that might increase prices, but as something that could reinforce the heart [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=261.04s)]
*  of what these campaigns are about. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=263.92s)]
*  You sound like an irritated Trump advisor trying to remind him to focus on the economy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=265.72s)]
*  No, but in all seriousness, the Trump campaign has talked about it a bit, but it has not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=270.04s)]
*  punched through all the other things he's talking about, which is namely defending himself [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=275.6s)]
*  against an indictment in the January 6th federal case and whatever else is on his mind at any [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=279.16s)]
*  given moment. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=285.2s)]
*  And so getting Trump to stick to a purely economic focused message, economy is still [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=286.2s)]
*  the top issue for voters, has been very, very challenging for the Trump team. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=291.08s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=295.4s)]
*  This actually presents a real opportunity. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=296.4s)]
*  It's just not one that he has delivered on effectively. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=297.96s)]
*  Why hasn't Harris delivered on it? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=300.08s)]
*  I think this is a risky proposition for both candidates. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=301.36s)]
*  We just talked about how this strike could spiral to affect millions of Americans. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=304.32s)]
*  We don't want to get on the wrong side of it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=308.08s)]
*  It's a dangerous game to side with a group of strikers who might disrupt the economy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=309.4s)]
*  Certainly the overall narrative is potentially convincing to a lot of voters, but if it ends [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=315.32s)]
*  up disrupting their lives and either candidate was on the picket line with them, there are [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=319.88s)]
*  real risks involved in that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  Let's turn to the war. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  The growing conflict between Israel, Hezbollah, Iran, Yemen is now in the mix as well. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=331.08s)]
*  And what kind of a challenge that presents to both campaigns. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=339.64s)]
*  You have already all suggested that in a pretty clear way, it reminds people that Harris is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  vice president in an administration that hasn't ended this conflict. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=348.36s)]
*  How does Donald Trump handle this? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=353.44s)]
*  Does he talk about it? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=355.4s)]
*  And does it matter, Nate, to voters very much? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=356.4s)]
*  I think that it clearly matters to a specific group of voters, Muslim and Arab voters, who [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=359.88s)]
*  are overrepresented in the state of Michigan. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=363.4s)]
*  And I think it also affects the overall national mood, the sense that the world is unsafe, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=366.96s)]
*  that the current administration is ineffective and not up to the task of solving problems [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=372.24s)]
*  at home or abroad. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=376.36s)]
*  And that back when Donald Trump was president, the world was more stable. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  It was at peace. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=380.8s)]
*  And I think it helps Donald Trump in that respect, even if it's not narrowly about whether [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=381.8s)]
*  anyone has any view of whether Israel should send tanks into Lebanon or not. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=385.96s)]
*  Is there a way in which the new developments in this conflict moves it away from that framework [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=389.8s)]
*  of simply Israel versus the Palestinians and towards a larger kind of geopolitical set [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=396.68s)]
*  of issues that perhaps is of value to a vice president who's still kind of very much searching [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=403.48s)]
*  for an identity on the world stage? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=409.16s)]
*  I don't see a world where this is helpful to the vice president. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=412.04s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=414.68s)]
*  It's a conflict that is evolving out of an already existing conflict that's been going [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=415.68s)]
*  on for a year now that the president, the current president, has struggled to contain, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=420.56s)]
*  has struggled to have the Israeli leader listen to him on various points that he's made. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=426.36s)]
*  And to your point, she is establishing herself on the world stage. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=431.8s)]
*  This is a very risky area in which to suddenly reveal yourself as to where you are and who [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=434.24s)]
*  you are. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=439.88s)]
*  It's also an issue that Trump has staked out real ground. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=441.0s)]
*  We have seen him do this since long before he was president, but certainly since he was [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=443.84s)]
*  president. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=447.32s)]
*  To never really be critical of Israel. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=448.32s)]
*  Well, he was very critical of Benjamin Netanyahu for congratulating President Biden for winning [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=449.32s)]
*  the election. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=453.24s)]
*  And then that caused this years long rift. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=454.24s)]
*  And Trump was initially somewhat callous in responding to the attack on Israel on October [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=457.32s)]
*  7th of last year. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=464.52s)]
*  And that was, again, a product of this personal animus that he had toward Netanyahu that has [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=466.28s)]
*  since been cleared up. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=470.68s)]
*  Trump has a history of making anti-Semitic comments, but that has not cost him with Republican [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=472.48s)]
*  leaning Jews and a lot of single issue Israel Jews in the U.S. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  So this is a much easier issue for him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  It's much harder for Harris to find ground on. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, during the vice presidential debate, I take notes on the computer and then I have [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=487.92s)]
*  like a side of paper where I circle something that feels particularly important. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=491.92s)]
*  And one of the first things I circled was JD Vance saying Donald Trump is the candidate [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=495.84000000000003s)]
*  of stability. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=501.12s)]
*  And this was, I think, a pretty audacious thing. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=502.12s)]
*  Democrats, Nikki Haley in the primary, they have called him the chaos candidate since [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=505.36s)]
*  Jeb Bush. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=509.20000000000005s)]
*  And here's his running mate say he is the stability candidate. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  And I think that it's worth thinking that this is an intentional frame that they're [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=514.2s)]
*  setting up for a story I worked on this week. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=517.16s)]
*  I talked to Matt Gaetz, congressman from Florida, really a close Trump ally, and he was very [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=519.96s)]
*  explicit about this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=524.48s)]
*  They are trying to say it was peaceful when he was president. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=525.84s)]
*  Yes, there was covid. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=529.3199999999999s)]
*  Maybe you don't remember all those specifics, but there was general economic prosperity [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=530.12s)]
*  in the first three years. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=534.0s)]
*  And they're trying to tap back into that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=535.0s)]
*  And I think you could take the totality of this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=536.88s)]
*  And that line from JD Vance, the candidate of stability was really striking. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=538.72s)]
*  OK, there was a development this week, though, that does not embody Trump's stability. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=541.92s)]
*  And that was the special counsel, Jack Smith, drawing us back into what may be one of the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  most unstable moments of the Trump presidency, which was the events before and on January [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=551.4s)]
*  6th. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=558.24s)]
*  So I want to know why Jack Smith did what he did just now. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=559.04s)]
*  We all understand that he was not able to bring his prosecution before the election. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=563.32s)]
*  Obviously, he and his staff wish they could. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=567.12s)]
*  Suddenly we get this big filing that contains a lot of new information. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=568.88s)]
*  Is that strategic? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=572.88s)]
*  And does it matter? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=574.12s)]
*  So Jack Smith brought this filing because Jack Smith has had to file a new indictment. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=576.0s)]
*  I shouldn't say he had to, but he did file a new indictment after the Supreme Court ruling [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=579.88s)]
*  on Trump and immunity that basically said essentially everything Trump had done in the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=584.28s)]
*  capacity as president in the context of this lead up to January 6th was in his capacity [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=589.48s)]
*  as president, an official act. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=594.48s)]
*  And so there's this whole issue of what constitutes an official act versus not official [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=595.88s)]
*  act. Jack Smith tailored this filing to explain essentially why the case should move [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=599.88s)]
*  forward. I'm condensing this, but it nicely. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=604.92s)]
*  Thank you. I'm trying. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=608.48s)]
*  If you read it and I would encourage people to read it because it's a really important [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=610.04s)]
*  historical read, this does potentially remind voters of a very damning fact set for [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=613.6s)]
*  Donald Trump. There was one particularly striking new piece of information, which is [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=620.76s)]
*  that when Trump was told of this chaos happening at the Capitol on January 6th, 2021, he's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=625.32s)]
*  at the White House. He's getting these updates. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=629.4s)]
*  Yeah. And Mike Pence, the vice president, is under threat, as are others. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=630.64s)]
*  Trump's response was allegedly so what? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=634.44s)]
*  Now, what's striking about this document is not that there are hugely surprising new [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=636.9200000000001s)]
*  damning details. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=642.52s)]
*  We always understood his approach to all that violence that day was basically to shrug. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=643.52s)]
*  It's a compilation of a really, really disquieting and disturbing series of reactions [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=647.24s)]
*  that he allegedly had and that his aides allegedly took and that a lot of people around [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=654.8s)]
*  him took with his desired impact being to overturn the election. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=658.12s)]
*  And it just it brings it all back with a month left until Election Day. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=662.1999999999999s)]
*  January 6th came up as a key moment in the vice presidential debate when Governor Waltz [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=667.24s)]
*  talked about it and pushed back on JD Vance. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=672.96s)]
*  You have Vice President Harris campaigning with Liz Cheney this week. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=675.9200000000001s)]
*  So there is just sort of this cumulative effect of reminding voters of what took place at [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=680.4000000000001s)]
*  the end. Right. Liz Cheney, of course, being the leader of the congressional committee [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=685.12s)]
*  that investigates January 6th and really makes America aware of the depth of the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=688.6800000000001s)]
*  president's disregard for the rule of law that day, but also his embrace of some of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  the violence. And a conservative Republican who would not normally be a Republican. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=699.44s)]
*  Ideologically aligned with Kamala Harris. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=702.96s)]
*  It's worth noting, too, that the Harris campaign has really struggled to make this [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  election about January 6th and democracy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=708.0s)]
*  The Biden campaign took for granted that in the end, voters would cast their ballots [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=709.64s)]
*  based on what happened that day. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=714.32s)]
*  And that was in part because in the midterm election, that seemed to have happened. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=716.08s)]
*  But there is no January 6th commission this time driving the news down the stretch. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=719.6s)]
*  And there isn't a way to stop the steel candidates campaigning on overturning the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=724.1600000000001s)]
*  election, the key battleground states as there was in the midterms. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=727.76s)]
*  I think it's a big deal that we have a series of news events this week that have put [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=730.88s)]
*  this issue back because it's a really good issue for Harris and one of the few issues [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=735.1600000000001s)]
*  that's really good for Harris. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=739.28s)]
*  It's the kind of issue that if it's what voters are thinking about, that her chances of [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=740.72s)]
*  winning go way up compared to a world where the swing voter looks at the news and sees [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=744.44s)]
*  chaos in the Middle East and strikes along the eastern seaboard. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=749.52s)]
*  I mean, this is like a central defining thing of the Biden campaign is they thought that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=753.12s)]
*  this was going to be the background music of 2024, just as it was in 2022. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=757.92s)]
*  And they were loud. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=762.4s)]
*  And it wasn't that loud. And when Harris has taken over, she's moved away from it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=763.12s)]
*  Right. The Biden campaign began with the word freedom and they were applying it to [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=766.36s)]
*  democracy and they're applying it to abortion. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=770.4s)]
*  Harris has applied it heavily to abortion and has not focused on this issue as much. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=772.68s)]
*  It's not a core part of her stump speech. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=776.76s)]
*  And so for her, it's good to have us out there without her having to talk about it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  She's going to talk about the economy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=782.56s)]
*  She's talking about the kitchen table issues. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=783.56s)]
*  That's what they think is going to win them this election. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=785.28s)]
*  But they want this to be part of the factors that people are thinking about, especially [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  those undecided voters. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=791.0s)]
*  But we shouldn't expect Vice President Harris to lean into this moment and try to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=791.64s)]
*  reorient the race back around to the issue of democracy to January 6th, to his efforts [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=795.52s)]
*  to overturn. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  They want to motivate their base on that issue. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=801.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=803.68s)]
*  And they did it right after the debate moment. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=804.04s)]
*  The first thing they said, they cut an ad. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=806.1999999999999s)]
*  The only ad they cut immediately after this debate was the collision between Tim [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=807.8399999999999s)]
*  Walls and JD Vance, where JD Vance would not say that Donald Trump lost the last [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=812.4s)]
*  election. That's the only ad the Harris campaign announced the next day that they [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=817.08s)]
*  had cut from the debate. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=819.88s)]
*  It wasn't the abortion answer, which was powerful. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=821.0400000000001s)]
*  It was this issue. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=823.5200000000001s)]
*  Last question on this. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=824.6s)]
*  Is there a world where January 6th re-emerging into the ecosystem of the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=825.36s)]
*  campaign is perhaps to Trump's advantage, maybe because he gets to re-up the [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=828.96s)]
*  argument that a witch hunt is going on. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=836.24s)]
*  That an election was stolen from him. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=838.64s)]
*  No, no. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=840.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=840.32s)]
*  I mean, he's, that's a uniform note. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=840.6s)]
*  He's maxed out on the voters of his who care about this and are going to get [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=842.2s)]
*  behind him on it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  There's a final thing that happened this week and Maggie, it's a line of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=846.44s)]
*  reporting that you pursued into Donald Trump's health. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=849.08s)]
*  What did you find? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=853.64s)]
*  Why did you do this? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=854.32s)]
*  And is what you found important? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=855.48s)]
*  So one of our colleagues and I worked on a story about where things stand with [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=858.64s)]
*  Trump health wise, because after the assassination attempt against him in [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=862.12s)]
*  Butler, Pennsylvania, he told a CBS reporter that he had taken a cognitive [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=866.6s)]
*  test and had to check up and he would gladly release the records and we asked [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=870.72s)]
*  for the records and after the shooting, he took a test. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=874.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=876.8800000000001s)]
*  So he says, and they won't release them. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=877.2800000000001s)]
*  They never did a medical briefing after the shooting in Butler. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=878.8800000000001s)]
*  He just went to the hospital, left the hospital. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=883.2s)]
*  They issued a statement saying he was fine. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  He took a CAT scan, but we don't know the results. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=887.0s)]
*  We know that he was sicker with COVID at the end of his presidency in [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=889.1600000000001s)]
*  2020 than they ever said. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  We know that his father had dementia. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=893.72s)]
*  We don't know much else about his family background. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=895.32s)]
*  We know that he was obese at clinically at points in the White House. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=897.72s)]
*  We know that he has high cholesterol. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=901.96s)]
*  Very high cholesterol according to what you found. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=904.36s)]
*  Some history of cardiac disease. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=905.88s)]
*  And so all of these are risk factors, especially when we were talking about [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=908.12s)]
*  someone who would be the oldest president at the end of his term, if he wins. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=912.28s)]
*  And these are valid questions. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=916.88s)]
*  They were valid questions about president Biden as well. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=918.36s)]
*  They are valid questions about Donald Trump. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=920.64s)]
*  Now we've also sought records for vice president Harris too. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=923.0s)]
*  It's important to understand the health of a sitting US president. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=926.16s)]
*  The former president is very secretive about a lot of personal matters, but [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=930.48s)]
*  particularly his health. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=933.48s)]
*  And he was very key to have his personal doctor released in an exuberant letter [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=934.44s)]
*  in 2016 saying, you know, he was the fittest person ever in the universe to [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=940.6s)]
*  president, incredible strength and stamina. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=946.24s)]
*  The files in that doctor's office, according to the doctor who's now passed [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  away, were later absconded with by people working for Trump. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=951.9200000000001s)]
*  So we don't really have a full picture of his health. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=956.52s)]
*  These are real questions. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=959.28s)]
*  Why do we think that the kind of collective political camera has never really [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=960.16s)]
*  swiveled around in a focused way, two questions around Donald Trump's health, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=964.44s)]
*  especially given his age, all the things you just said in the way that they did [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=969.52s)]
*  so forcefully around Joe Biden. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=973.04s)]
*  I mean, I think for the most part it's because he was running against Joe Biden [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=974.6s)]
*  and the physical diminishment of Joe Biden was there for everyone to see in a [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=977.76s)]
*  way that it has not been as apparent for Donald Trump. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=983.72s)]
*  You could just see the aging of Joe Biden before your eyes. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=986.6800000000001s)]
*  But it is true that Donald Trump, should he win, would be older at every stage of [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  his presidency because he's older when he would take the oath of office than Biden [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=994.52s)]
*  was. And these are really legitimate questions. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  You saw what aging happened at that age in a president. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1001.1600000000001s)]
*  You saw what an 80 year old president looks like and you would see that again if [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1004.76s)]
*  Donald Trump were to win. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1008.84s)]
*  And so I think these questions about his health and that secrecy is really a point [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1009.72s)]
*  of tension and something of interest to voters. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1013.76s)]
*  We saw how much voters cared about the mental state of the president. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1015.52s)]
*  And I think it's a really good question in a line of reporting for Trump. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1019.88s)]
*  Where is the line between whether someone is too old and not fit to be president [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1023.08s)]
*  versus just young enough? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1027.52s)]
*  And at some point, Joe Biden crossed that line and the electorate reacted [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1028.72s)]
*  decisively. They went from saying he was fit to be president by a three to one [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1031.84s)]
*  margin to saying he wasn't by a three to one margin. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1035.08s)]
*  For whatever reason, Donald Trump hasn't crossed that line. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1037.68s)]
*  He may be very close to it and we don't know. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1039.8s)]
*  We didn't know when Joe Biden took office, how close he was and where that line [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1041.4s)]
*  would be. But Donald Trump hasn't crossed this invisible threshold. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1044.56s)]
*  All right, with that, we're going to take a break and Maggie, I'd like you to have [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1050.9199999999998s)]
*  the honors again. We'll be right back. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1053.76s)]
*  Wow. Wow. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1055.9199999999998s)]
*  She's like nailed it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  So you made a claim over the past week that I want to explain and then I want to [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1075.56s)]
*  kind of fact check it based on everything that we just talked about. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1083.44s)]
*  You had said that we've entered a stretch of the race that is placid, where there [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1087.32s)]
*  hasn't been too much going on and where as a result, there's a kind of clearer [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1093.44s)]
*  than ever understanding of the race. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1098.1599999999999s)]
*  So I want you to justify that and especially given how much news there was [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1100.64s)]
*  over the past few days. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1106.24s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I mean, stepping back for a second, the last two months have been full [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1106.8400000000001s)]
*  of big political events. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1110.8400000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden dropped out of the race. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1113.1200000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris introduced herself to the nation. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1114.88s)]
*  She selected a vice president. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1116.68s)]
*  There was a Democratic convention and there was a presidential debate in a six [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1117.8000000000002s)]
*  week period. Each of those events. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1123.0s)]
*  You didn't even mention the two assassination attempts. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1124.8400000000001s)]
*  I didn't even mention the assassination attempts or before that, that Donald [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1126.36s)]
*  Trump was convicted of crimes. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1131.04s)]
*  In any case, each of these events raised a big question about would there be a big [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1132.9199999999998s)]
*  effect on the race? Would voters react to Harris's debate victory? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1137.6s)]
*  Would the convention make a splash? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1142.8799999999999s)]
*  And similarly, the polls taken after each of those events were clouded by these [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1145.2s)]
*  same questions. Is this just a reflection of a post debate balance or a post [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1150.24s)]
*  convention bounce or a post VP pick bounce? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1154.0s)]
*  And I don't think we have those same questions today. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1157.2s)]
*  There is still plenty of news going on. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1159.88s)]
*  We've talked about that news, but I don't think that there are any of the sort of [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1161.68s)]
*  classic events that have the potential to distort public opinion. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1166.2s)]
*  And it's also noteworthy that the polls have been relatively stable the last two [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1170.04s)]
*  weeks. We've seen almost no change in the polling averages that we publish here at [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1173.76s)]
*  The New York Times. They show a really close race and between the relative [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1177.44s)]
*  stability of the news and the stability of the numbers, I think we can say this is [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1182.44s)]
*  the race we have right now with far fewer questions than with far fewer questions [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1185.8400000000001s)]
*  than we've had to this point. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1190.16s)]
*  OK, and within that framework, briefly, what is this resting stable state stasis [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1191.28s)]
*  exactly? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1199.3200000000002s)]
*  The resting stable stasis appears to be something like a more or less exact tie [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1200.48s)]
*  with Harris. It is a stunning statement and it's not something that we've seen in [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1205.8400000000001s)]
*  the time. At least I've been covering polls and I think if you look back [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1211.08s)]
*  historically, you'll find that it's very rare or maybe even unprecedented. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1213.56s)]
*  No longer term, no discernible real favorite in the polls. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1216.6799999999998s)]
*  If you had to squint, you would say, well, I guess the average of polls is Harris [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1220.6799999999998s)]
*  ahead by like seven tenths of a point in Pennsylvania. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1224.0s)]
*  And therefore, if the polls were absolutely perfect, which they're not, she'd win by [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1226.8s)]
*  one state. But it can't be any closer. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1230.76s)]
*  Do the campaigns embrace that understanding? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1233.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, very much. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  I think I think both campaigns embrace that understanding and they know that there [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1237.24s)]
*  are seven states that are being competed in and that speaking of those polling and [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1240.6s)]
*  polling averages and polling misses, that if the polls are off by a little chunk, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1245.96s)]
*  that all seven states could still move, right? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1251.6s)]
*  That these are these are states that are in play, that places like Arizona, which [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1254.4s)]
*  appears like more of a reach state for Kamala Harris, is not out of play. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1258.64s)]
*  And you look where they're spending their money and it's in all of these places. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1262.4s)]
*  The places you see more money going lately, they tell you that they're competitive, like [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1266.0s)]
*  North Carolina. The Trump team has moved more money there when he was running against [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1269.4s)]
*  Joe Biden. They thought this was a state they had more or less in the bag on those [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  lists of seven. They no longer feel that way. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1277.52s)]
*  And you see the Harris campaign putting money, putting time in time is the most [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1279.96s)]
*  valuable resource at this point. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1284.8400000000001s)]
*  They have one month left. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1286.2s)]
*  Watch where the candidates go. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1287.92s)]
*  Watch where they spend their money. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1289.8s)]
*  That's the answer to where they think this race is happening. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1291.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, tell us don't make us watch. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1293.96s)]
*  Tell us where the candidates are spending their time and money, how they're going to [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1296.76s)]
*  be making the most of these dwindling final days of the race, which constituencies [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1300.92s)]
*  they're going to be most focused on, given just how startlingly close the race is. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1305.44s)]
*  It's going to change a lot. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1310.08s)]
*  They're both going to be ripping up their schedules. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1311.56s)]
*  I think really Trump more than Harris. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1313.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Trump's been very reactive. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1314.8400000000001s)]
*  Harris has tended to have a little bit more of a direct theory of the case of where she [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1316.76s)]
*  wants to campaign. But which is what? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1320.56s)]
*  Just briefly. Which is she is going to the three blue wall states, Pennsylvania, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1322.8s)]
*  Wisconsin, Michigan. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1327.64s)]
*  If she loses those, her path is pretty difficult. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1328.8s)]
*  Trump, you are going to see try to shore up North Carolina, try to shore up Georgia [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1331.6s)]
*  to states that she could win. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1335.68s)]
*  The Trump campaign feels very good about Arizona and Nevada. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1337.36s)]
*  Democrats feel a little better about Nevada than Republicans think they should. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1340.92s)]
*  We will find out who is right. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1345.8s)]
*  Trump is hanging his hat on a turnout of low propensity voters, younger men, all [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1347.24s)]
*  across the board. In particular, Nate can speak to this more eloquently than I can. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1352.68s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1356.44s)]
*  Thank you. Love that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1358.16s)]
*  Very eloquent. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1360.48s)]
*  But they can't guarantee these folks are going to come out and vote. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1361.8s)]
*  Because they are low propensity voters. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1364.28s)]
*  Correct. And so that's a big gamble. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1365.1200000000001s)]
*  And so you were going to see Trump doing not just, you know, in-person events. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1366.6000000000001s)]
*  And he is constrained, as Shane and Jonathan Swan and I reported recently, by these [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1370.96s)]
*  security threats against him. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1375.92s)]
*  He is not a sitting president or vice president. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  He just simply has a different level of security and he's a little more vulnerable. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1379.8s)]
*  But you are going to see him doing podcasts. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1383.68s)]
*  You are going to see him continuing to sort of reach out to people in unique media ways. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1386.16s)]
*  And we will see where it all falls in a couple of weeks. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1390.68s)]
*  To win, you need 270 electoral votes. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1393.4s)]
*  And there was just a fight recently about one state that splits up its votes, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1396.24s)]
*  Nebraska, in a single district that Democrats are favored to win. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1401.32s)]
*  And Republicans were trying to flip this rules in Nebraska. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1405.68s)]
*  So all of the electoral votes would have gone to Trump. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1408.6s)]
*  The effort failed, but this was about that blue wall. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1411.44s)]
*  Because if you didn't flip that and Harris just won those three states, Michigan, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1414.2s)]
*  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, she and he would end at a 269 tie. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1419.36s)]
*  Like, it's not even unlikely they were talking about plans to get to a tie. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1424.96s)]
*  That's how close this race is. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1429.6s)]
*  And that's why the Trump folks wanted to change the rules in Nebraska. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1430.6399999999999s)]
*  They wanted in the event of a tie for that final tie breaking vote to not go to [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1434.24s)]
*  Kamala Harris, they wanted a winner take all model that would go to his. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1440.0s)]
*  I don't know how replicable whatever Donald Trump ends up with in this coalition [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1442.9199999999998s)]
*  that he is building will be for another Republican who comes after him. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1447.52s)]
*  So what does that mean for Republicans? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1451.48s)]
*  Well, I think it means that Donald Trump, as problematic as he has been for down [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1453.1999999999998s)]
*  ballot in particular, is still their best hope at winning a national election for [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1457.08s)]
*  the foreseeable future. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1461.08s)]
*  And maybe that won't be true, but we'll see. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1462.0s)]
*  Or at the very least, a hypothetical Republican national victory would look [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1463.48s)]
*  really different than the one that Donald Trump might be about to pull off. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1467.0s)]
*  What does it look like? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1470.28s)]
*  I don't know that we'll find out what the final election result will be. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1471.8s)]
*  But if it turns out that Harris narrowly wins in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1475.56s)]
*  other critical battleground states while struggling nationwide, I think it will be [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1481.08s)]
*  hard to wonder whether Donald Trump's Stop the Steal campaign was a relevant factor [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1484.84s)]
*  in why he just couldn't quite do as well in the very states with the very voters [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1490.84s)]
*  whose votes he tried to throw out last time around. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  So January 6th will come back. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1499.08s)]
*  And that is what happened in 2022 in the midterm. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1500.08s)]
*  It's very hard for us in the polling world to find this. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1503.4399999999998s)]
*  We're talking to such a small number of people, like maybe one in a hundred people [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1505.4399999999998s)]
*  or one in 50 of Trump's former supporters just being like, you know what, that was [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1508.52s)]
*  over the line. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1512.9599999999998s)]
*  The election denier. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1513.6399999999999s)]
*  It was their votes. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1514.32s)]
*  And maybe that's what it is. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1515.36s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1517.4399999999998s)]
*  And again, to bring it back to Jack Smith, here he is on his own terms, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1518.3200000000002s)]
*  re-injecting that subject into the race. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1522.28s)]
*  And re-injecting that subject in its rawest form without anything that Trump can say, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1524.3200000000002s)]
*  this was in my power as presidency. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1528.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure he will still make that argument, but Jack Smith's trying to avoid [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1530.04s)]
*  it. And it's still a pretty bad fact set for Donald Trump. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1533.3200000000002s)]
*  As you guys know, roundtable is exceptionally hard to end because it's round. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1537.2s)]
*  There's no place to get a handle on it. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1540.4s)]
*  Can't just fall off. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1542.52s)]
*  Time is a flat roundtable. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1543.1200000000001s)]
*  But I want to try with just. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1544.64s)]
*  But in my effort to try to end this roundtable, there was a quirky bit of news [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1548.88s)]
*  that floated into the universe over the past few days. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1553.0s)]
*  Melania Trump is pro-choice. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1555.88s)]
*  Her husband, more than any single elected official in the history of the Republic, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1559.5200000000002s)]
*  has restricted abortion. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1564.44s)]
*  She said this in her book. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1566.6000000000001s)]
*  She said it in her book. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1567.96s)]
*  And the Trumps have a history of putting things in books that make a lot of news [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1569.0400000000002s)]
*  and sell those books. And I think there is a world in which this is not a hidden [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1573.24s)]
*  attempt to try to soften him, although I imagine that he would welcome that and [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1577.4s)]
*  would make him happy. And it was simply a way for her to get her thoughts out and [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1581.0800000000002s)]
*  get attention. But attention it is getting. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1584.72s)]
*  It is not something that former White House advisors remember her talking about [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1587.32s)]
*  in either direction, pro or con. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  Abortion rights was not exactly a small issue when he was in office. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1594.2s)]
*  He was in the middle of appointing this conservative supermajority of the Supreme [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1597.44s)]
*  Court, as you noted, that repealed the Roe v. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1600.56s)]
*  Wade abortion rights decision from 1973. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1603.0s)]
*  And she is apparently against it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1605.56s)]
*  And her husband is still struggling mightily with how to articulate what he [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1607.8s)]
*  actually thinks on abortion while also saying that he terminated Roe v. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1612.72s)]
*  Wade and he's very proud of it. So I don't know how these two things align or how [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  voters will receive it. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1621.08s)]
*  It's just interesting that a first lady who has been a complete nonentity on the [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1622.08s)]
*  campaign trail kind of peeks up and says, I disagree with my husband. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1626.2s)]
*  On the most volatile issue on which her husband is deeply aware of his [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1630.3999999999999s)]
*  vulnerability. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1635.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1636.2s)]
*  I hear you guys saying that there might be more than meets the eye. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1636.76s)]
*  It's hard not to see the timing in an October book is anything but strategic to [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1639.04s)]
*  release this. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1644.36s)]
*  In other words, I don't find it that hard to see it as anything other than strategic. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1644.8s)]
*  I'm accepting the political world you all live in every day. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1648.8799999999999s)]
*  It's hard to imagine he didn't know that she was going to do it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1652.92s)]
*  I don't think that the entire book was built around her saying this and having [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1655.2s)]
*  it come out in October. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1659.2s)]
*  Have you read it? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1660.1200000000001s)]
*  I've not. I don't have it yet. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1661.16s)]
*  I have pre-ordered it though, as I do all political books. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1662.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. Right. No favoritism here. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1665.48s)]
*  On that note, Maggie, Shane, Nate, thank you very much. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1667.96s)]

*  We'll do it again soonish. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1674.32s)]
*  On Thursday night, after my conversation with Maggie, Nate and Shane, the union [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1683.52s)]
*  representing Longshoremen suspended their strike after receiving a higher offer [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1688.8799999999999s)]
*  on wages from their employers. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1694.84s)]
*  But the union cautioned that no deal had been reached and that their strike [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1697.48s)]
*  could eventually resume. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1703.24s)]

*  On Thursday, the Israeli military issued evacuation warnings for more than 20 [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hr94arO1vs&t=1730.4399999999998s)]
