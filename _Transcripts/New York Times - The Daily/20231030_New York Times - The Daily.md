# Israel's Invasion Begins
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mG_1CncoZw)
*  I'm Raja Abdel Raheem, and I'm a reporter in the Jerusalem Bureau, and I've been covering
*  the war in Gaza for the past three weeks.
*  On Friday, I was reporting out a story about basically it was a sentiment that I was starting
*  to hear a lot from people that death felt inevitable.
*  There's now more than 8,000 deaths in Gaza, more than a third of them children, and we're
*  hearing basically entire families are being killed in one strike.
*  I spoke to a woman in Gaza.
*  Her name is Ulfet El-Kurd.
*  And she told me that 70 members of her family had been killed.
*  Aunts, uncles, cousins, you know, she'd almost lost count of them.
*  And what she was telling me and what I've been hearing a lot is that these huge death
*  tolls, and when everybody around you, when everybody you love is being killed, it just
*  makes people feel that their turn is next.
*  The smell of death actually hangs in the air because there's so many bodies, more than
*  a thousand, that are under the rubble because they don't have the equipment or they don't
*  have the ability to get them out.
*  I also spoke with a poet and an essayist, Mus'ab Abu Taha.
*  And he was telling me about how when you're sitting in your home or wherever you are and
*  you hear the approach of a rocket, the sound feels like it's coming for you, like it feels
*  like it's intended for you.
*  I asked him some more questions, but I suddenly noticed that the messages weren't being delivered
*  and I wasn't hearing back.
*  And it wasn't until a little later that we realized that all phone and internet in Gaza
*  were down.
*  It was very scary to have no eyes on the ground and to not know what was happening in the
*  middle of a war zone.
*  Luckily, our stringer, Amira, her husband actually has an Israeli SIM card and she was
*  able to message us.
*  I got a very panicked message from her and in this moment she's talking as a Palestinian,
*  as a journalist, as a mother.
*  People are very scared and terrified.
*  They keep asking us as a journalist, do you know what happened?
*  What's the news?
*  Is there is any ceasefire?
*  Where they bombed last night?
*  And she told me that there was so much fear and so much panic and so much confusion on
*  the ground because everybody was worried.
*  What did this blackout mean and what was Israel planning to do?
*  Morning, Riza.
*  We all fine here in the camp.
*  So far we don't know what happened in Gaza.
*  We even we cannot even reach my family, like my mom, my sisters in Gaza City to check how
*  they are or if they survive this night or not.
*  And that's the thing with this blackout is that not only were people in Gaza cut off
*  from the rest of the world, but they were cut off from each other.
*  During the night, they were very heavy bombing and a lot of clashes like shooting.
*  We hear the shooting.
*  We hear that there is like fight.
*  And what was happening was that it was the most intense night of the war so far in terms
*  of Israeli airstrikes.
*  A lot of Palestinians describe it as the most terrifying night they'd ever lived.
*  By cutting the communication and the telephone lines, they cannot even people call the ambulance
*  or call the civil defense or call anyone to come to help them.
*  She was telling me about how the ambulance services, because nobody was able to call
*  them.
*  They didn't know where to go.
*  They are looking for the smoke to know exactly where is the area of the bombing.
*  And they are asking people around to reach the area where they bombed so they can go
*  and help people.
*  And so some of them were following the sounds of people screaming or they were basically
*  just driving through the streets looking for places that had been recently hit with Israeli
*  airstrikes.
*  And then suddenly Sunday morning, the phone and internet was restored.
*  People's phones were started getting messages and a lot of it were messages of other family
*  members trying to check up on them.
*  But also it was a lot of the news of what had happened since Friday night.
*  And they saw that Israel had started to conduct its ground invasion and this causes obviously
*  a whole new level of fear.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  Over the weekend, the Israeli military appears to have begun an invasion of the Gaza Strip
*  with tanks rolling into the enclave and Israeli soldiers fighting with Hamas inside.
*  But the operation remains shrouded in secrecy with Israel revealing little about its actions.
*  Today, my colleagues Raja Abdurahim and Patrick Kingsley on the latest escalation in the war.
*  It's Monday, October 30th.
*  So Patrick, we're reaching you on Sunday at about 3 p.m. Eastern Time and that's
*  9 p.m. your time in Jerusalem.
*  And we just heard from our colleague Raja.
*  She was talking about how things had changed in Gaza over the weekend.
*  And I'm wondering if you can tell us what you know about what happened in Israel over
*  the past three days.
*  So, what did we start to see happen?
*  Early on Friday evening, we began hearing reports of a massive aerial bombardment over
*  Gaza.
*  But at the same time, we were hearing very little about what was actually going on under
*  those bombs because it seemed like there was a communications blackout at that time.
*  The military was conspicuously quiet.
*  It was hard to get any clear answers from them about what was going on.
*  In fact, it was hard to get them to pick up the phone.
*  And then finally, at around 9 p.m., amid this shroud of secrecy and silence, the chief
*  military spokesman came out and made a very vague statement in which he said that Israel
*  was expanding its ground activity.
*  As Friday bled into Saturday, we started to see the first footage of tanks inside Gaza.
*  And it started to feel like this incursion into northern Gaza was something more than
*  just the hours long incursions that we'd seen on previous nights.
*  But it wasn't until late afternoon on Saturday that we felt ready to call this the invasion.
*  This was the start of the big push that we'd been expecting for three weeks.
*  And what was it about what happened late afternoon on Saturday that caused you to start calling
*  it an invasion?
*  Firstly, the fact they were still there.
*  The fact that the military still seemed to be there some 12 hours after they entered.
*  Secondly, the information we were getting from military sources about the numbers of
*  troops that were now inside, the number of tanks, the number of armored vehicles, the
*  number of bulldozers.
*  It eventually became clear that this was a major invasive force.
*  And while it wasn't some kind of blitzkrieg rush on Gaza City, Hamas's stronghold, it
*  was nevertheless the start of what is the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.
*  And Patrick, what about Hamas?
*  What were they saying?
*  Hamas made two brief announcements, or rather their military wing made two brief announcements.
*  They said they were engaging troops in the north and also a bit further south.
*  And that corresponds now to what we know about the Israeli invasion.
*  They invaded around those two places.
*  And clearly they ran into Hamas fighters.
*  What those battles looked like, we don't really know because there was so little information
*  coming out of Gaza and the Israeli army were also keeping very quiet about what was going
*  on.
*  Why was the Israeli army keeping so quiet?
*  It's not entirely clear, but we think one reason was that they wanted to maintain the
*  element of surprise, make Hamas unsure about what was going on.
*  Secondly, we think perhaps that Israel wanted to avoid scrutiny and it wants to avoid outcry
*  across the Middle East and to avoid an immediate reaction from southern Lebanon where Hezbollah,
*  another militia allied to Hamas, holds sway and which Israelis had feared might launch
*  its own major attack on Israel if it felt that Hamas was under threat due to the ground
*  invasion.
*  So Israel making its advance during a communication blackout and without formally announcing it
*  themselves created a sense of uncertainty about what was actually going on that therefore
*  made journalists like us worry about reporting anything and potentially also prevented groups
*  like Hezbollah from making their own reaction.
*  Okay, so this is the invasion that we were all anticipating, but at the same time you're
*  saying it's kind of different.
*  What makes you say that?
*  How is it different than what we expected?
*  I think we expected, perhaps naively, that we would know what was going on in real time,
*  that we'd have photography, video of something happening.
*  In retrospect, we now know certain details.
*  We know they entered from the northwest of Gaza.
*  At least some of the forces advanced down the Gaza coastline.
*  There's video now that's been released from the Israeli army that shows tanks and other
*  vehicles moving along the beaches of northern Gaza.
*  A video has also emerged of a pair of Israeli soldiers standing atop what is believed to
*  be beachside hotel raising an Israeli flag.
*  We also understand that so far the Israeli army has not pushed that far deep into Gaza.
*  It hasn't entered into Gaza City, the biggest urban center of the enclave.
*  It appears to be waiting, almost surrounding the city.
*  This has been accompanied by many statements from Israeli officials both in the military
*  and outside saying that this is going to be a long, long process and that they won't be
*  charging into Gaza City as quickly as perhaps we'd expected three weeks ago.
*  Why do you think the Israeli military is taking this kind of different approach?
*  Do you think that they were responding to pressure from the US?
*  Well you're right that the US has been warning Israel not to act out of emotion, not to act
*  too swiftly, to make sure that they have clear plans in place before moving in.
*  Everyone's worried about the outbreak of a regional war and it's quite possible that
*  this maneuver shrouded in secrecy was intended to try and delay any prospect of regional
*  reaction for as long as possible until the invasion seemed a fait accompli that could
*  not be stopped.
*  And perhaps that's why there was essentially a day of uncertainty and the fog over what
*  was going on.
*  And by the time that Benjamin Netanyahu made his speech on Saturday night in which he announced
*  the second phase of this conflict, the Israeli army had already been inside Gaza for more
*  than 24 hours and their presence was a fact rather than a possibility.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick you told us that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a speech on Saturday
*  night.
*  What did he say?
*  He said a number of things.
*  The first is that this is the second stage of the war and that was significant because
*  it confirmed what we'd already gathered by ourselves by that point, which is that the
*  invasion had begun.
*  Yet he didn't actually use the word invasion.
*  Then he said,
*  The war inside Gaza will be long and difficult and we are ready for it.
*  And that was perhaps aimed at the Israeli public that is going to have to come to terms
*  with many losses to its own in the coming months.
*  Then he talks about meeting the families of Israeli hostages who were kidnapped during
*  Hamas's own invasion of Israeli territory on October 7.
*  And he said we will exhaust every possibility to bring our brothers and sisters back to
*  their families.
*  That was an attempt to reassure the families of the hostages who have enormous public
*  sympathy and support that this invasion is not intended to come at the cost of those
*  hostages' lives.
*  And what else did Netanyahu say in the speech?
*  He talked about one supreme goal, to destroy the murderous enemy and ensure our existence
*  in our land.
*  And that is maybe tilted towards the international audience.
*  It's a reminder that for Israelis, they cannot countenance living next to Hamas on its borders
*  for another minute.
*  And then finally, he says that this is our second war of independence.
*  The first so-called war of independence was in 1948 when Israel's fledgling army defeated
*  several Arab armies and Palestinian militias in order to create the boundaries of the modern
*  state.
*  And that war was and remains a unifying event in the minds of most Israelis because it was
*  the foundational event of the state of Israel.
*  So by talking about it, Netanyahu was trying to present himself as a unifying leader, someone
*  that can bring Israelis together after a period of great division in Israeli society.
*  And to supporters that may have felt credible, to critics that would have come across as
*  very hollow.
*  And to Palestinians, that same comment would have felt very chilling, but for different
*  reasons.
*  During the 1948 war, some 700,000 Palestinian Arabs or 80% of the Arab population of Mandate
*  Palestine, the territory that Israel was formed from in 1948, either fled their homes or forced
*  to flee their homes, never to return.
*  And that moment in Palestinian history is known as the Nakba or catastrophe.
*  It was hugely traumatic and remains perhaps the defining moment of the Palestinian experience
*  and is seen as almost the start of all the Palestinian trauma over the past 75 years.
*  So that was Saturday, but on the ground in Gaza, things were still very uncertain and
*  it was very unclear what was going on.
*  Okay, so that's Saturday night.
*  Today's Sunday.
*  Tell me what we've learned now that the communications have come back online.
*  We're learning that once again, there was devastating loss of civilian life in Gaza.
*  We're learning that the fighting inside Gaza appears to have taken its first Israeli casualties.
*  Israeli casualties.
*  The Israeli military said this morning that two soldiers had been wounded during the fighting
*  that started after the invasion.
*  And we learn from the Israeli military that they say that they have hit 450 military targets
*  throughout Saturday and early Sunday.
*  And those targets include command centers, observation posts, anti-tank missile launch posts,
*  and leaders of Hamas's military wing.
*  We also know that they say that they hit 150 underground facilities, some of which may indeed be tunnels.
*  All these are impossible to verify.
*  So Patrick, stepping back here for a minute, where do you think we are in this war right now?
*  Netanyahu said we are in a second phase.
*  You know, we don't know how many more there will be.
*  Where are we and where are we going?
*  Well, the entire region is waiting with bated breath to see how do Hamas's allies in southern Lebanon respond.
*  Will they up the ante?
*  Will they launch missiles and rockets deeper into Israeli territory?
*  Or will they hold fire and prevent a major escalation on the Israeli-Lebanese border?
*  Inside Gaza, we are braced for what many think will be the bloodiest phase of what has already been a catastrophically bloody war.
*  8,000 Palestinians have already died, 1,400 Israelis.
*  And the ground phase of the war is thought by most analysts to be the deadliest one.
*  Once the Israeli army moves from the countryside outside Gaza City into the city itself,
*  and is met by Hamas fighters on their home turf, emerging from secret exit points from their tunnel network,
*  the war is going to get very bloody indeed for Palestinian civilians, also for Hamas and also for Israeli soldiers.
*  And quite what Gaza will look like at the end of it is unclear.
*  We're at the edge of a precipice and we don't know exactly where we, where Gaza are going to land.
*  Patrick, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  The Times reports that the United States believes that Israel was responsible for the communications loss in Gaza
*  and that Washington had pressed Israeli leaders to restore the service.
*  On Sunday, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone
*  and urged him to conduct operations, quote, in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law.
*  Also on Sunday, as desperation in Gaza spread, thousands of people broke into UN food warehouses
*  and took wheat flour and other basic survival items.
*  More aid came into Gaza from Egypt on Sunday in all 33 trucks, but aid groups said it was not nearly enough.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Friday, the man suspected of killing 18 people and injuring 13 others at a bar and a bowling alley in Lewiston, Maine,
*  was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
*  The discovery of the perpetrator of Wednesday's mass shooting ended a sweeping manhunt
*  that had forced thousands of residents throughout the region to remain in their homes.
*  Meanwhile, questions continued to build over whether more could have been done
*  to prevent the gunman, who officials said had paranoid beliefs, from owning a gun.
*  Today's episode was produced by Jessica Chung, Sydney Harper, and Rachelle Bonja with help from Ricky Nowacki.
*  It was edited by Patricia Willens and Lisa Chow, contains original music by Alicia Bitutube and Marian Lozano,
*  and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the daily. I'm Sabrina Tavernisi. See you tomorrow.
