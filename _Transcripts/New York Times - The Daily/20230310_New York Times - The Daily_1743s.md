# Protests and the Future of Democracy in Israel
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM26etn2ehE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi. And this is The Daily.
*  Since Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition took power late last year in Israel, violence
*  between Israelis and Palestinians has been escalating. At the same time, there's another
*  crisis taking hold.
*  We are right in the heart of Tel Aviv. And you can see thousands and thousands of protesters
*  here have just brought this city to an absolute standstill.
*  One that has sparked massive protests and divided Israelis deeply over a question that's
*  fundamental to Israel's democracy and to what kind of country it will become.
*  We're here to demonstrate for the democracy. Without democracy, there is no state of Israel.
*  Today, my colleague Patrick Kingsley on what is driving some of the biggest protests in
*  Israeli history and why this moment is so pivotal for the country's future.
*  It's Friday, March 10th.
*  So Patrick, I've been reading about what's been happening in Israel. And from what it
*  looks like, we're really in a crisis moment here, where the conflict isn't just between
*  Israelis and Palestinians, but actually among Jewish Israelis themselves.
*  Tell us what's going on.
*  Well since the start of the year, we've had these two crises. We've had a very painful
*  violent start to the year where there's been a rise in violence that has left more than
*  70 Palestinians dead and at least 14 Israelis dead. But in parallel, inside Israel, there
*  is something that's far rarer, which is a domestic internal crisis between Jewish Israelis
*  that has set off a wave of mass protests. And these are protests that illustrate deep
*  divisions between different groups in Israeli society, religious, secular, different social
*  And at the center of this dramatic battle is the Israeli judicial system and in particular,
*  its Supreme Court.
*  And Patrick, what is it in particular about the Supreme Court that is making it such a
*  lightning rod right now?
*  Fundamentally, this is a question about the future and nature of Israeli democracy itself,
*  Because the far-right government that entered office here late last year, led by Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  wants to limit the court's influence. And one large part of Israeli society believes
*  that the court is too powerful and its influence needs to be limited in order to ensure that
*  elected lawmakers have more power and influence than unelected judges on the Supreme Court.
*  And another large part of Israeli society completely disagrees and it says, no, we need
*  to protect the court, we need to protect the court's influence because the court is the
*  only check and balance on the power of the government of the day. And without the court,
*  we cannot ensure a balance of power between the different arms of government.
*  So this is a really fundamental fight that is playing out here, one that is in essence
*  about the soul of Israel.
*  Help us understand how things have gotten to this point.
*  So to understand it, I think we should go back about 30 years to the early 1990s. Unlike
*  the United States, Israel had never had a formal written constitution and still doesn't.
*  But in the early 1990s, lawmakers began to try to create quasi-constitutional laws, something
*  akin to a bill of rights that set out certain personal human rights. And in doing so, they
*  basically opened the door for the Supreme Court to intervene when future laws contravened
*  those basic personal rights that were enshrined by the new legislation in the 1990s.
*  So in other words, it set up a situation that when the parliament passed a law that potentially
*  infringed on rights of minorities or other rights, the court could come in and strike
*  it down.
*  Exactly. And this was a big shift in the court's role in Israel. And the judge that became
*  most associated with this transition was the man who was the chief justice of the court
*  from the mid-90s until the mid-2000s, Aharon Barak.
*  And tell us about him.
*  Barak was born before the Second World War in Eastern Europe. He survived the Holocaust.
*  He moved to Israel. He gets a law degree. He becomes a towering figure in the legal
*  community. He becomes an attorney general, a peace negotiator briefly between Israel
*  and Egypt. And he eventually becomes head of the Supreme Court in 1995. And while there
*  are very many people involved in this judicial change in the 90s, he has become the one person
*  most associated with it because he's spoken often and written often about the merits of
*  judicial intervention in public life, sometimes called judicial activism.
*  According to my approach, judges in modern democracies have a major role to play in protecting
*  democracy.
*  He believes that the court system is an important check on the power of government. And without
*  judicial intervention, a government can become too powerful.
*  We, the judges of this generation, are charged with watching over our basic values and protecting
*  them against those who challenge them.
*  He famously popularized the term constitutional revolution to describe the empowerment of
*  the Supreme Court.
*  We cannot take the continued existence of democracy for granted.
*  So how did that work in practice?
*  Well, in practice, at least initially, this new legal principle wasn't really used very
*  much. But then this newly empowered court makes a few decisions that put it firmly in
*  the crosshairs of different parts of the Israeli bright.
*  And perhaps the best example of this was in 2012, when the Supreme Court moved to overturn
*  a law that gave ultra-orthodox Israeli Jews a deferment to army service.
*  And it's important to remember that in Israel, military service is mandatory for most Jewish
*  Israeli citizens. But ultra-orthodox Jews had basically been given an exception so that
*  they could study Jewish law.
*  And the court thought this shouldn't be the case, that no group should be given special
*  favors. And so they overturned the law.
*  Ultra-orthodox Jews felt that the court was trying to meddle in their way of life with
*  that decision.
*  Another key moment was in 2020, when the court makes a decision that angers another part
*  of the Israeli right, the settler movement.
*  The court scrutinized a law that was passed by parliament that would have authorized settlements
*  in the West Bank that had been built without government permission on private Palestinian
*  land.
*  The court decided to overturn the law. It said that the law infringed on the property
*  rights of the Palestinians. And in the process, the settler movement felt that the court was
*  interfering in their political aspirations of settling on more and more of the West Bank.
*  So basically, it sounds like this frustration that the far right and ultra-orthodox in Israeli
*  society had at the decisions the court was making was mounting over time as the court
*  intervened in each of these decisions that were really about core issues in Israeli society.
*  Absolutely. And on top of that, there were other instances where the court made huge decisions
*  that, though it wasn't necessarily overruling parliament, was nevertheless again and again
*  angering the Israeli right. And there's one decision from the mid-2000s that really hangs
*  over all of this.
*  The Israeli government decided in 2005 to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and get rid of
*  all the settlements in the Strip that had been established since Israel occupied Gaza
*  in 1967. And the court backed that decision. It was an enormously emotional moment and
*  an enormously emotional decision for Israel and for Israelis. Some people saw this as
*  a vital step towards making peace with the Palestinians, and others saw it as the uprooting
*  of thousands of Israeli settlers from their homes. And to this day, it's a decision that
*  is still raised by people on the Israeli right, in particular the people that want the Supreme
*  Court to be undermined as part of their broader argument that the court is doing and has done
*  the bidding of the left.
*  And I mean, is that a fair assessment given all these decisions?
*  Well, in reality, things are more complex. For a start, while the court has taken decisions
*  that have gone against certain particularly ambitious goals of the settler movement, the
*  court has been broadly supportive of the settlement enterprise. There are even judges today who
*  live in settlements in the West Bank. But nevertheless, it has also taken decisions
*  that in some cases have favored Palestinians, favored minorities, and the strong perception
*  remains among the far right that this is a left-wing court that is blocking the will
*  of the Israeli majority.
*  And in the process of all that...
*  Political leaders of parties on the right took up this frustration as a political cause.
*  I think that the Supreme Court took power without authority and that there is too much
*  activists...
*  They have long said that something needs to be done, that some of the Supreme Court's
*  power needs to be taken away.
*  And we're committed to solve the issue of judicial activism at large...
*  But for many years, they didn't really have any means of doing that because they never
*  had enough seats in parliament to have full control over parliament. And so they had to
*  compromise and these designs that they had on the Supreme Court never materialized.
*  But then late last year, that all changed.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, you said before the break that late last year, the far right got their chance
*  to change things with the court. And of course, the one thing I know about late last year
*  in Israel, mainly from you because we did a show about it, was that there was a big,
*  very important election. How did that affect what the right wanted to do with the court?
*  Well, as we discussed the last time we chatted on this show, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's
*  longest serving prime minister, was on the ropes last year. He was facing a corruption
*  trial. He's still on trial for corruption. And because of that trial, he had been rejected by
*  many of his previous more moderate coalition partners. And so to re-enter power, he strikes
*  a deal with a bunch of far right parties in order to form a majority coalition in the Israeli
*  parliament, which puts him in an interesting spot. In the past, he was a supporter of the Supreme
*  Court's independence. He even gave this big speech backing the court and its role in 2012.
*  And spoke about how great it was to have this balance between the
*  Supreme Court and parliament. And in previous governments, he had kept at bay
*  any demands from right-wing colleagues to overhaul the court because he would always create coalitions
*  with parties from both his left and his right. But this time was different.
*  Mr. Netanyahu is in a position to lead a religious and right-wing majority coalition.
*  This time his hands were more tied because this coalition is Israel's most right-wing government
*  ever. He's actually one of the most left-wing members of that government. And what that means
*  is that these far-right parties and even right-wing members of his own party have been able to push
*  this goal that they've always wanted to achieve.
*  So they're in power. They have a green light effectively to do this thing that they've wanted
*  to do for a long time and they push on the gas. What is in the plan?
*  There's quite a few technical things in the plan, but there are two central points.
*  The first point is that the government wants to give itself control over who gets to be a judge,
*  who gets appointed to the Supreme Court. They want to avoid more Aharon Barak's, to put it simply.
*  The second central point is they want to limit the influence that the Supreme Court can have
*  over parliament. They want to give parliament the ability to override the court's decisions
*  and they want to reduce the instances where the court can override parliamentary decisions. So
*  they want to avoid another repeat of the 2020 ruling that the Supreme Court made about
*  settlements. And what was the reaction to this? It was furious.
*  Aharon Barak, the Chief Justice, whom we mentioned earlier and who's been retired for a while but has
*  remained a figure in public life, he weighed in on these proposals shortly after they were first
*  announced and he said that they were a string of poison pills. There were the mass protests,
*  as we mentioned, there are the mass protests, but also pressure has been steadily rising from
*  all corners of Israeli life. Some of the most successful names in Israeli tech, such as Verbit
*  and Disruptive, are now threatening to move elsewhere. We saw tech leaders, businessmen,
*  saying they were either going to pull out their money or going ahead and doing so. They believe
*  that the reform threatens the country's business-friendly environment by weakening
*  the legal system. And just a few days ago. Now protests are emerging even within the nation's
*  military. We also had military reservists who play a crucial role in Israeli military
*  operational capacity, hold a private meeting with senior commanders,
*  expressing ambivalence about serving if the court overhaul goes through.
*  And as you said earlier, some of what's worrying Israelis here is the idea that the court would
*  no longer serve as a check on the government. I get why that's a concern, but what in particular
*  are Israelis worried might happen? There were quite a few things. One of them is the fear that
*  Mr. Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, as we mentioned, might somehow take advantage of a
*  neutered Supreme Court to subsequently push through legislation that might help him either escape
*  punishment or end his trial altogether. Now he denies that, but that is the fear of his opponents.
*  And his opponents also fear for what these judicial changes would do to Israel at large. What kind of
*  government and what kind of country would result if this overhaul was enacted in full? And in the
*  longer term, I think there's a demographic concern here. Simply put, the religious part of the
*  population, which tends to lean right wing, is growing faster, is having more babies, than the
*  secular part, which leans to the left. And there's a fear that with a majority in the population,
*  the right leaning section of society would have a lock on parliament. And without an independent
*  judicial system, without an independent Supreme Court, the parliament would be able to trample
*  on the rights of minorities, on secular Jews, on people who for years have been the mainstream of
*  Jewish society, but in 30, 40, 50 years might no longer be so. One caveat is that the people
*  protesting against this overhaul are not monolithic. They do include people from religious backgrounds.
*  They do include people from right wing backgrounds. Nevertheless, I think it's fair to say that a
*  significant part, maybe the majority of the people who are protesting are those who feel that they
*  would be left out in this more religious, more conservative new Israel that has been emerging
*  over the last few years. And due to demographic trends, feels like we'll become more entrenched
*  in the coming decades. Patrick, on top of all of this unrest, you have also been writing about
*  clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinians in the West Bank. There's been this
*  pretty steep death toll, as you noted in the beginning of our conversation over the past
*  couple of months. Is there a connection here? Well, on the surface, these feel like two different
*  crises. And at a first glance, they might not seem connected. But actually, there is a common
*  thread. In the West Bank, we see growing activity by Palestinian armed groups and growing number of
*  raids by the Israeli army. We see more attacks by Palestinian government on
*  Israeli civilians. And we also see rising violence by extremist settlers, including
*  arson attacks on homes and cars two weekends ago. And the connection between these two crises
*  is this, that some of the people who are driving some of the unrest in the West Bank
*  were also simultaneously driving the judicial changes. After the arson attacks that I just
*  mentioned, the far right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said that he wanted the town that was
*  attacked in those arson attacks to be wiped out, to be erased. And he said that it was the state
*  that should be doing that. He later walked back some of those comments, but he said them in the
*  first place. And he's also one of the same guys who for years has been pushing for the undermining
*  of the Supreme Court. He's one of the lawmakers that was behind that legislation that the Supreme
*  Court struck down in 2020 that would have favored settlers in the West Bank. And so he's an example,
*  firstly, of how some of the same people creating a more combustible dynamic in the occupied West
*  Bank are also some of the same people who are driving these judicial changes. And he's also an
*  example of why some of these folks want to neuter the Supreme Court. They want to do so in order to
*  build more settlements more easily in more places in the West Bank. And they want to have fewer
*  limits from the Israeli judiciary, from the Israeli Supreme Court on that activity.
*  Right. This is precisely something that the court presumably would have stopped. And now,
*  you know, the people who were involved in calls to violence like this are actually
*  in the state, running the state, and want the state to be unfettered, if you will.
*  That's more or less it. And actually, these comments are part of what is driving the concerns
*  from military reservists that I mentioned earlier. During those private meetings with
*  military commanders, reservists raised the concern that without a strong Supreme Court,
*  someone like Betsalel Smotrich might be able to order the army to carry out illegal operations
*  or immoral operations. And it's comments like the one he made last week about wiping out a
*  Palestinian town that are driving some of those fears about the knock-on effects of neutering the
*  Supreme Court. So the issue of court reform is existential to many Israelis, kind of for two
*  reasons. Like you said, it's about the future of Israeli democracy, and that's really at stake,
*  as many people see it. But also, it just raises pretty urgent questions about, you know, what it
*  would mean to take this guardrail away in a region that's already very inflamed.
*  Yes, and people are worried. Polling from February suggested that more than a third of Israelis fear
*  that this whole crisis could eventually erupt into a civil war. Civil war? Is that a possibility?
*  It's certainly what people are talking about. You read about it in the newspaper, you see it in
*  polling. It may very well be hyperbole and the reactions of people who are feeling simply very
*  emotional about a difficult moment in the country's history. But whether or not it actually gets to
*  that point, and obviously everyone hopes it doesn't, but the fact it's even being discussed
*  and written about in a semi-serious way illustrates the emotion of the moment.
*  Patrick, where is all this leading? Well, there are still several parliamentary hurdles that have
*  to be cleared in order for this overhaul to be enacted. And certainly at the moment,
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition has the numbers to pass these proposals, to put them into law. But
*  it's starting to feel like the situation is spiraling out of control. And there's a sense that
*  even among the government supporters that something needs to give. So it could very well be that we
*  see some sort of compromise in the coming weeks. And if we don't, the situation could spiral even
*  further. For decades, Israel has projected itself as the only democracy in the Middle East. And
*  that determination has always been contested by Palestinians who say you can't have democracy
*  when you're occupying the West Bank. But now even Israelis are wondering about whether that claim
*  of being a shining democracy is under threat and the next few months will be a decisive factor in
*  that debate. Patrick, thank you. Thank you, Sabrina, for having me on.
*  On Thursday, Israel's mainly ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, took an unusually
*  strong stance against the overhaul.
*  He said that the proposal, as it is currently drafted, quote,
*  undermines the foundations of democracy and needs to disappear from this world and soon.
*  Netanyahu, for his part, said he was open to dialogue, but did not say that he would give up on the overhaul.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. Folks, let me tell you what I value with the budget I'm
*  releasing today. President Joe Biden proposed a budget on Thursday, the third of his presidency,
*  a $6.8 trillion plan that would increase spending on the military and a broad range of new social
*  programs while also reducing future budget deficits. Republican control of the House
*  ensures that the full blueprint has no chance of becoming law. But the plan sets the stakes
*  for a bigger fight over raising the federal debt limit and the nation's fiscal trajectory.
*  It also serves as a kind of campaign preview for Biden's expected 2024 reelection bid.
*  And the Times reports that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office has signaled to
*  Donald Trump's lawyers that Trump could face criminal charges for his role in the payment
*  of hush money to a porn star. Prosecutors offered Trump the chance to testify next week before a
*  grand jury. Such offers almost always indicate that an indictment is close. Any case would
*  mark the first time a former American president is indicted and could upend the 2024 race,
*  in which Trump remains a leading contender.
