# The Supreme Court Is Not Done Remaking America
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBp3SXrIq0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  When the Supreme Court wrapped up its term last week, much of the focus was on the ruling
*  that gave Donald Trump sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution.
*  But as my colleague Adam Liptak explains, a set of rulings that generated far less attention
*  could have just as big an impact on American government and society.
*  It's Monday, July 8th.
*  Adam, welcome back.
*  I mean, it hasn't been very long, but we want to talk to you about the rest of the
*  Supreme Court's decisions that happened over the past few weeks.
*  The rest meaning the non-Trump decisions.
*  There were a lot of other cases, many of which we covered on the show over the past year,
*  but we haven't yet talked about where the justices landed as they issued their rulings
*  on these cases over the past few weeks.
*  So I wonder if you can walk us through some of the bigger decisions and what taken as
*  a whole this entire term really means.
*  So where should we start?
*  Well, this term had so many major cases, Michael, on so many important issues touching all aspects
*  of American politics and society that it's a little hard to know where to start.
*  But I think one way to think about the term is to ask how much is this a 6-3 court?
*  You know, the six conservatives in the majority, the three liberal justices in dissent, are
*  we going to get that kind of classic lineup time after time after time?
*  And one way to start answering that question is to look at two areas which are kind of
*  part of the court's greatest hits, areas where they've done a lot of work in the last few
*  terms, guns and abortion.
*  Okay, let's start with guns.
*  The court had two big guns cases.
*  One of them involved the Second Amendment and broke 8-1 against Second Amendment rights.
*  Only Justice Clarence Thomas, the most avid supporter of gun rights, was in dissent.
*  So let me tell you just a little bit about this case.
*  Please.
*  There's a federal law that says people subject to domestic violence restraining orders, it's
*  a crime for them to have guns.
*  A guy named Zaki Rahimi was subject to such a domestic violence restraining order, but
*  he goes to court and says, this law violates my Second Amendment rights.
*  The Second Amendment protects me and allows me to have a gun even if I'm in this status.
*  And that goes to the Supreme Court.
*  And the way the Supreme Court analyzes this question is it looks to a test that it established
*  only a couple years ago in 2022, which said you judge the constitutionality of gun control
*  laws using history.
*  You kind of go back in time and you see whether the community in the founding era disarmed
*  people in the same way that the current law disarms people.
*  And you might think that actually back in the 1700s, there were no such things as domestic
*  violence restraining orders.
*  So you might think that the answer is this contemporary law is unconstitutional.
*  Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for an eight justice majority, says, no, that's not
*  quite right.
*  We're going to kind of roll back the specificity of the test and look at very general principles.
*  Can you disarm dangerous people back then?
*  And if you can do that, then you can disarm Rahimi even under this law that the founding
*  generation could not have contemplated.
*  That's really interesting.
*  The Supreme Court, as conservative majority especially, seems to be saying that our last
*  big decision made it too hard to regulate guns.
*  We need to fix that.
*  So we're going to search really hard for a way to make sure that somebody with a restraining
*  order for domestic abuse can't legally have a gun.
*  Right.
*  On the other hand, there was a second guns case not involving the Second Amendment, but
*  posing an important issue.
*  The question in the case was whether the Trump administration was allowed to enact a gun
*  control regulation in 2017 after the Las Vegas shooting in which at an outdoor music festival,
*  gunmen killed 58 people, wounded 500 more.
*  And the Trump administration, prompted by this massacre, they issue a regulation that
*  tries to outlaw bump stocks.
*  What are bump stocks?
*  They're devices that turn semi-automatic weapons into weapons that can fire at rates approaching
*  a machine gun.
*  And drawing on the authority of a 1934 law, which bans for the most part, civilian ownership
*  of machine guns, it said bump stocks are basically the same thing and we will by regulation outlaw
*  them.
*  And the question for the court was, did the 1934 law authorize that?
*  And here, and this is a typical split on this kind of stuff, the majority, the conservative
*  majority takes a textualist approach.
*  It bears down on the particular words of the statute.
*  And Justice Thomas looks at the words that Congress said a machine gun is one where a
*  single function of the trigger causes all of these bullets to fly.
*  And a bump stock, he said, is not precisely that.
*  Therefore, we're going to strike down this regulation.
*  So how do you reconcile these two divergent gun rulings?
*  One where the court works really hard to allow for gun restrictions in the case of domestic
*  abusers.
*  And another where they seem to have no compunction about allowing for a bump stock that I think
*  of us practically speaking understand as making a semi-automatic weapon automatic in the real
*  world.
*  I think the court draws a real distinction between two kinds of cases.
*  One is about interpreting the Constitution, interpreting the Second Amendment.
*  And in that area, it is plowing new ground.
*  It has issued maybe four major Second Amendment cases, and it's trying to figure out how that
*  works and what the limits are.
*  And the Rahimi case shows you that they're still finding their way.
*  They're trying to find the right balance in that constitutional realm where they are the
*  last word.
*  The bump stocks case doesn't involve the Constitution.
*  It involves an interpretation of a statute enacted by Congress.
*  And the majority in those kinds of cases tends to read statutes narrowly.
*  And they would say that that's acceptable because unlike in a constitutional case, if
*  it's about a congressional statute, Congress can go back and fix it.
*  Congress can say whatever it likes.
*  The Samuel Alito said in the bump stocks case, this massacre was terrible.
*  And it's a pity Congress didn't act.
*  But if Congress doesn't act, a regulator can't step in and do what Congress didn't do.
*  Hmm.
*  That's interesting because it suggests a surprising level of open-mindedness among even the court's
*  most conservative justices to an interpretation of the Constitution that may allow for a greater
*  level of gun regulation than perhaps we think of them as being interested in.
*  Yeah.
*  When we're talking about the Constitution, they do seem more open to regulating guns
*  than you might have thought.
*  Okay.
*  You also mentioned, Adam, abortion.
*  Let's talk about those decisions from this court.
*  So the court in 2022, as everyone knows, overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminated the constitutional
*  right to abortion.
*  But in two cases this term, they effectively enhanced the availability of abortion.
*  One of them involves emergency rooms.
*  There's a federal statute that says that emergency rooms that receive federal money have to treat
*  patients and give them stabilizing care if they arrive in the emergency room.
*  That seems to conflict with a strict Idaho law that prohibits abortions except to save
*  the life of the mother.
*  The court agrees to hear the case.
*  It hears arguments.
*  And then it dismisses the case.
*  It dismisses it as improvidently granted, which is judicial speak for never mind.
*  But it's very tentative.
*  The court merely dismissed the case.
*  It said it was too early to hear it.
*  They're going to look at it later.
*  So it's a very tentative sliver of a victory for abortion rights.
*  But nonetheless, the effect of this is to suspend the Idaho law, at least to the extent
*  it conflicts with the federal law, and it lets emergency abortions continue.
*  Women in Idaho have more access to emergency abortions as a consequence of this decision
*  than if the court had gone the other way.
*  And of course, the other abortion case centered on the abortion pill, Mifepristone.
*  Right.
*  And that pill is used in a majority of abortions, and the availability of that pill is crucial
*  to what remains of abortion rights in the United States.
*  Lower courts had said that the Food and Drug Administration exceeded its authority in approving
*  these abortion pills.
*  And the case comes to the Supreme Court.
*  And here again, they rule in favor of abortion rights.
*  They maintain the availability of these pills.
*  But they do so again, in a kind of technical way that does not assure that the pills will
*  forever remain available.
*  What the court says merely and unanimously is that the particular plaintiffs who challenged
*  the law, doctors and medical groups who oppose abortion, didn't have standing, hadn't suffered
*  the sort of direct injury that gave them the right to sue.
*  And it got rid of the case on standing grounds.
*  But that's not a permanent decision.
*  Other people, other groups can sue, have sued.
*  And the court didn't decide whether the FDA approval was proper or not, only that the
*  lawsuit couldn't go forward.
*  And here too, this case is a victory for abortion rights, but maybe an ephemeral one and may
*  well return to the court, which is not given an indication of how it will turn out if they
*  actually address the merits.
*  Got it.
*  So this is a court, the one you're describing in these rulings, acting with some nuance
*  and some restraint.
*  Yeah, this picture is complicated.
*  This is not the court that we're used to thinking about.
*  There are a lot of cross currents.
*  There are a lot of surprises.
*  And that was true in those cases on big issues on guns and abortion.
*  But in another set of cases, the court moved aggressively to the right and really took
*  on the very power and structure of the federal government.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, tell us about these cases where the court was less nuanced, less, perhaps, judicious,
*  and really tried to move aggressively to the right and take on the power of government.
*  So it's been a long term goal of the conservative legal movement to weaken the power of regulators,
*  of taking on what they call the administrative state.
*  And this term, the court really vindicated that decades old project, primarily by overruling
*  the foundational precedent in this area, a precedent that gave expert agencies the power
*  to interpret federal laws and enact regulations to protect consumers, investors, all manner
*  of people.
*  And the court overruled that decision called Chevron.
*  It was as important as the court two years ago overruling the right to abortion.
*  One year ago, overruling affirmative action in higher education.
*  This decision will reshape the way the federal government does its work.
*  Right.
*  And Adam, as I recall, because we did a whole episode about this with you, Chevron created
*  a framework whereby if a law has any ambiguity about how it's supposed to play out, that
*  the experts within the federal government, within the EPA or the FDA, you name the agency,
*  that we collectively defer to them and their wisdom and that that becomes the basis for
*  how these laws get interpreted and carried out.
*  That's right.
*  And if you think about it, Michael, Congress can't anticipate every circumstance.
*  Congress will on purpose sometimes and inevitably at other times leave gaps in the law.
*  And those gaps need to be filled by someone.
*  And the choice that the Chevron decision made was to say, we're going to let the expert
*  regulator fill in those gaps.
*  If there are ambiguities in statutes, the reasonable interpretation of the regulator
*  will get deference from courts.
*  Experts not judges will decide this matter, is what Chevron said 40 years ago.
*  Right.
*  And it's really hard to overstate the consequences of overruling Chevron.
*  It will open countless, countless regulations to judicial challenge.
*  It may actually kind of swamp the courts.
*  The courts have relied very heavily on Chevron to make difficult decisions about complicated
*  stuff.
*  Questions about the environment and food safety and drugs and securities, questions that really
*  often require quite technical expertise.
*  So what was the court's rationale for changing that Chevron framework that's been in place
*  for so long?
*  What the Sixth Justice majority opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts says is that Chevron
*  was a wrong turn from the outset, that unelected bureaucrats should not be empowered to say
*  what the law means, that that's the job of judges.
*  So it moves from the expert agency to federal judges the determination of all sorts of important
*  And it probably has the effect of deregulating much of American society.
*  I mean in the old world, the regulator had a thumb on the scale.
*  The regulator's interpretation of an ambiguous statute was the one that counted and now the
*  judge will have a fresh look at it.
*  That doesn't mean that in every case the challenger wins and in every case the regulator loses,
*  but it shifts the balance and it makes challenges more likely to succeed.
*  Okay, where else did we see this instinct by the court to challenge the government's
*  authority in this term?
*  So right after the court overturns Chevron, it issues a second decision that really amplifies
*  the power of that decision because it says that challenges can be brought not only in
*  the usual six year statute of limitations from when a regulation is issued, but six
*  years from when it first affects a company.
*  And bear with me because that's a big difference.
*  If I start a company tomorrow, I have six years to sue over a regulation that affects
*  it even though that regulation may have been in place for 30 years.
*  So it restarts the clock on challenges and that one-two punch, both of them decided by
*  six three majorities, go even further in reshaping the ability of the federal government to regulate.
*  I just want to be sure I understand something.
*  So in the past, let's say the Clean Water Act was passed in the 1970s, under the old
*  statute of limitations, a company could sue and say that regulation is a problem for six
*  years. But you're saying a new company formed right now could go back and sue over something
*  in a 30 or 40 year old law and how it's being interpreted.
*  In other words, this ruling means there really isn't a statute of limitations on challenging
*  these regulations any longer.
*  That's right. And it's not as though you can't form a company just for the purpose of
*  litigation. I mean, it completely opens up the ability of industries, trade groups, just
*  to set up a trivial nothing company that will then be said to be affected by the regulation
*  and then can sue from now until the end of time.
*  And the liberal justice is sure understood what was happening here, that this one-two
*  punch, as Justice Katanji Jackson wrote in dissent, was a catastrophe for regulators.
*  She wrote, at the end of a momentous term, this much is clear that tsunami of lawsuits
*  against agencies that the court's holdings in this case have authorized has the potential
*  to devastate the functioning of the federal government.
*  It's a pretty searing warning.
*  Yeah, I mean, talking about regulations and administrative law might put some people to
*  sleep, but this is a really big deal, Michael.
*  And as if those two cases were not a substantial enough attack on the federal government's
*  regulatory authority, the court also issues a third 6-3 decision undoing one of the main
*  ways that regulators file enforcement actions against people who they say have violated
*  the law. They don't always go to court.
*  Sometimes they go to administrative tribunals within the agency.
*  The court says, no, that's no good.
*  Only courts can adjudicate these matters.
*  So it's just another instance of the court being consistently hostile to the administrative
*  state.
*  Adam, all three of these decisions might sound pretty dangerous if you have a lot of confidence
*  in the federal government and in the judgments of regulators and bureaucrats to interpret
*  things. But if you're one of the many Americans who doesn't have a whole lot of faith in the
*  federal government, I have to imagine all of these rulings might seem pretty constructive.
*  That's an excellent point.
*  Lots of people are skeptical of regulators, are skeptical of what they would call the
*  deep state of unelected bureaucrats, of even the idea of expertise.
*  And so for those people, this is a step in the right direction.
*  Taking power away from bureaucrats and handing it to what we would hope are independent,
*  fair-minded judges.
*  What does seem clear, Adam, is that even though this episode was supposed to be about the
*  rest of the Supreme Court's rulings this year, the less sexy sounding decisions than
*  Trump and immunity and how much power and protection all future presidents have, the
*  rulings that you're describing around the government's administrative power, they seem
*  like they're going to have the greatest long term impact on how our government functions
*  and in a sense, what our society looks like.
*  Well, the biggest case of the term is obviously the Trump immunity case.
*  That's a decision for the ages.
*  But close behind these decisions reshaping the administrative state and vindicating a
*  long held goal of the conservative legal movement going back to the Reagan administration
*  that the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group has been pushing for decades and
*  really unraveling a conception of what the federal government does that's been in place
*  since the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his New Deal.
*  So as much as we've been talking about other cases where the court was tentative, surprising
*  nuanced in the biggest cases of the term, all delivered by six to three votes, all
*  controlled by the conservative supermajority, the court was not nuanced.
*  It was straightforward and it reshaped American government.
*  In the end, a hard right court is going to, no matter how much it might deviate, operate
*  like a hard right court.
*  Yes, Michael, it's possible to look at the balance of the decisions and draw all kinds
*  of complicated conclusions about the court.
*  But when you look at the biggest cases, the picture you see is a conservative court moving
*  the law to the right.
*  Adam, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Times reports that four senior Democratic House members have told colleagues that
*  President Biden must step aside as the party's nominee over fears that he is no longer
*  capable of winning.
*  They include the top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, the Armed Services
*  Committee and the Veterans Affairs Committee.
*  Those top Democrats joined five rank and file House Democrats who have publicly called
*  for Biden to step down.
*  The latest of those was Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, who represents a swing
*  district in the state.
*  In a statement, Craig said that after watching Biden in the first debate, quote, I do not
*  believe that the president can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump.
*  Senate Democrats remain largely quiet on the question of Biden's future.
*  I probably heard you had a little debate last week.
*  Can't say it's my best performance.
*  In several appearances over the weekend, Biden acknowledged the growing skepticism of
*  his candidacy.
*  But ever since then, there's been a lot of speculation.
*  What's Joe going to do?
*  But emphatically rejected the calls to step aside.
*  Well, let me say this clearly as I can.
*  I'm staying in the race.
*  And in a surprise electoral upset, France's political left was projected to win the
*  largest number of seats in the National Assembly after the latest round of voting.
*  The anti-immigrant far right had been expected to make history by winning the most
*  seats. But a last minute scramble by left wing parties averted that result.
