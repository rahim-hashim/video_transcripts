# As Marijuana’s Popularity Grows, So Do Its Harms
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUaEXlmpirw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily.
*  This election day, recreational marijuana could become legal across more than half of
*  the United States.
*  But as more Americans consume more potent forms of the drug more often, a Times investigation
*  has revealed that some of the heaviest users are experiencing serious and unexpected harms
*  to their health.
*  Today, I spoke with my colleague, investigative reporter Megan Toohey, about what she found.
*  It's Tuesday, October 22nd.
*  Hi, Megan.
*  Hey, Rachel.
*  Thank you for being here.
*  So, Megan, today we're going to talk about something that a lot of people, myself included,
*  have at least a glancing familiarity with, and that's marijuana.
*  So tell me, first of all, how did you come to this story?
*  Well, full disclosure, I am one of those people who has some familiarity with marijuana.
*  I have dabbled in it on and off stretching back to the 1990s.
*  And so I, as a consumer, have also been among those who have noticed the drastic transformation
*  of marijuana in this country in recent years as legalization spread and the commercialized
*  legal industry sprung up and began offering products.
*  And so here in New York, a couple years ago, when we implemented the legalization of recreational
*  marijuana, there was sort of all of a sudden dispensary selling products on nearly every
*  corner.
*  Everywhere.
*  Everywhere.
*  And so I was one of the people who started going into the dispensaries and immediately
*  noticed that the products I was seeing there were very different from some of the products
*  I had consumed.
*  There were pre-rolled joints and gummies and these almost pure concentrates of THC, which
*  is the intoxicating component of marijuana.
*  And so I could see for the first time that there was a huge range and that there were
*  products that had really, really high levels of THC.
*  And so I would purchase these little containers of gummies that contain five milligrams of
*  THC, which is on the very low end.
*  But when I would go home and take little bites of them, in my experience, they were actually
*  quite strong and were being framed as completely almost innocuous.
*  You know, I have to tell you, I've also had kind of a hard time navigating this market
*  and these shops that are for recreational use.
*  But you can also go in and you can say something like, I have a headache or I have trouble
*  sleeping. And somebody who is not a doctor, is not a pharmacist, is suddenly recommending
*  a product to you to help you with your health issue.
*  Well, I think you make a really good point, Rachel, which is that legalization of marijuana
*  began as the legalization of medical marijuana in this country.
*  I mean, the first states to legalize did that for the purposes of people being able to use
*  it for health reasons.
*  But what we have seen in the last 10 years is that what began as a medical marijuana
*  market has been superseded by a recreational marijuana market.
*  And, you know, the promise of legalization was that it was going to make marijuana more
*  safe, that with legalization, you'd have regulation and oversight and more protection of consumers.
*  But there's now a $33 billion industry that sprung up to deliver these products in this
*  newly legal market.
*  And the products that they're delivering are at potency levels that were almost unimaginable
*  a generation ago.
*  And I knew from not just my own personal experience of interfacing with the commercial market,
*  but also from people in my life and in my various orbits, I was hearing about people
*  who were actually struggling with marijuana.
*  And those folks and their families had a lot of confusion.
*  Like what isn't this supposed to be this totally safe and totally natural and now totally legal
*  drug?
*  And it just felt like there was a real vacuum of information.
*  So what did you do just to start trying to understand this world that's obviously confusing
*  a lot of people?
*  So with that kind of initial interest, I just started to make some phone calls.
*  And one of the first people I called was a longtime medical marijuana researcher who
*  helped develop a couple of the only pharmaceutical drugs that have cannabis components that have
*  received regulatory approval.
*  Interestingly enough, one of the first things he said to me was, oh my God, good luck reporting
*  into this.
*  It's like a total jungle.
*  I've been in this world for decades and even I have a hard time following exactly what's
*  going on because so much has been shifting so fast.
*  And so that was a little scary to hear, but also intriguing.
*  And one of the things that he said was that he had major concerns with the way that legalization
*  and commercialization of marijuana was playing out here in the United States.
*  He said that scientists and researchers and doctors like himself were on the sidelines
*  that they weren't being consulted as this was rolling out and that the industry that
*  had sprung up, this $33 billion industry, was also not focused on the therapeutic products
*  of the drug, but instead had basically ended up in a race to produce the most potent products,
*  the most intoxicating products possible.
*  And what I next realized was that there was a real dearth of research, of scientific research
*  into the effects of marijuana.
*  And that's in part because while marijuana is now legal in about half the states, it
*  has remained illegal at the federal level.
*  And it's also in this highly restrictive category of drug, which makes it really challenging
*  for people to do research on it.
*  Also the hospital and other health care data on the effects of marijuana was really inadequate.
*  And the patchwork of state laws that had sprung up to govern this was not equipped to do any
*  meaningful tracking of the health outcomes.
*  And so after a while, I realized that if we really wanted to have a deeper understanding
*  of how this drug was affecting consumers across the country, we were going to have to figure
*  out ways to gather that information ourselves.
*  I was lucky enough to at this point be joined by two of my colleagues on the investigations
*  team, Danielle Ivory and Carson Kessler.
*  And one of the first things that we sought to tackle was this data set on drug use in
*  this country.
*  Every year the government does a population survey that asks Americans about their use
*  of drugs and how frequently they use it and seeks to measure the effect on their lives.
*  And mostly what people have focused on are opioids, because historically those drugs
*  have killed the most people and done the most harm.
*  So what this survey has shown on marijuana use hasn't received a ton of attention.
*  It's sort of been flying under the radar.
*  But we found a researcher at Columbia University who has looked at this data and looked at
*  specifically at marijuana.
*  And we asked her to do a more detailed analysis of those responses for us.
*  And what did that analysis find?
*  Well the survey has turned up some very interesting trends with regards to marijuana use in this
*  country.
*  It has shown that as legalization and commercialization of marijuana has taken off and accelerated,
*  marijuana use has been going up steadily among people 18 and over.
*  And it's not just that more people are consuming here and there.
*  There are pretty sharp rising rates of people who are using it on a daily or near daily
*  basis.
*  And this survey showed that in 2022 in fact, for the very first time, more people said
*  that they were using marijuana on a daily or near daily basis than said they were using
*  alcohol.
*  But not only are people using marijuana at higher rates than ever before, more people
*  are reporting that their marijuana use is having a negative impact on their lives.
*  And this is more broadly known as cannabis use disorder.
*  There's 11 specific criteria that are used to measure whether or not somebody is having
*  like a problematic use of a drug.
*  And you know, it ranges from like building up tolerance to craving the drug to not being
*  able to stop even if it's having negative effects on your social life or your job.
*  And you know, if you meet two of the criteria, then you are considered to have a mild case
*  of cannabis use disorder.
*  And then on the far end, if you meet six or more criteria, then you are considered to
*  have a severe cannabis use disorder, widely seen as addiction.
*  What this analysis showed was that 30% of cannabis users 18 and over reported having
*  some level of cannabis use disorder.
*  That's like an estimated 18 million Americans.
*  And of those, about 3 million people are considered addicted.
*  I have to say, I was really surprised to hear that, that people could be addicted to marijuana.
*  And frankly, I guess I was like a little skeptical when we were discussing and planning this
*  episode.
*  And it actually prompted a whole discussion here at the Daily about this, where people
*  were saying, you know, actually, I know this one person who has an addiction problem.
*  I know this other person who has an addiction problem.
*  It was really, at least for me, it was really quite eye opening.
*  Yeah, listen, I think that there has long been this belief that marijuana is not addictive.
*  And I think that that's in large part because it presents differently than, say, alcohol
*  addiction or opioid addiction, for which withdrawal can sometimes be so severe that it can be
*  fatal.
*  But in recent years, medical experts have been able to show how when our systems are
*  basically overrun with THC, you need more and more to get the same effect.
*  And when you stop using, you can experience anxiety, depression, and other symptoms of
*  withdrawal.
*  So what else did you find in your analysis of the data?
*  We found that this problematic use of marijuana is, you know, really stark among young people.
*  Like in the 18 to 25 year old group, 4.5 million of them use marijuana daily or near daily.
*  And of those, 81% meet the criteria of cannabis use disorder in some way.
*  Wow, so basically millions of young people are using marijuana every day and a huge percentage
*  of them are reporting problems with it.
*  So I mean, doesn't that seem like a clear warning sign?
*  Yes, like for sure.
*  Now I should say the vast majority of people who use just general users of marijuana are
*  not having problems with it.
*  But we wanted to learn more about those who were.
*  And when we started gathering more information, we were surprised by just how severe some
*  of those issues could get.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so what kind of problems were chronic users reporting?
*  Well there were actually a couple of issues that we heard about.
*  And to get a clearer picture of them and understand how common they were, we started crafting
*  a bunch of surveys and we posted them in a Facebook group where people had come together
*  to discuss one of these severe health effects from marijuana.
*  And we also sent out surveys to doctors from a variety of fields across the country, asking
*  what they were seeing with their patients.
*  And we started to see some really concerning issues again and again.
*  Like what?
*  Well, let me tell you about one woman we met.
*  Hello.
*  Hi, is this Jennifer?
*  Yes it is.
*  Her name is Jennifer Macaluso.
*  She's from Illinois and my colleague, Danielle Ivory, spoke to her over the phone.
*  Is this still a good time for you to talk?
*  Yeah, this is great.
*  Alright, excellent.
*  And in a way, Jennifer is a great example of a kind of person who started using weed
*  post-legalization.
*  You know, I'm 51.
*  I used cannabis briefly when I was a teenager, like a lot of kids do.
*  You know, I wasn't addicted.
*  You know, nothing.
*  It was social, whatever.
*  You know, she had smoked when she was a teen, but nothing very serious and had actually
*  stopped as an adult until she got a bit older.
*  In 2019, I started having some other health problems.
*  She got migraines and she took a lot of medication to get them under control.
*  Here I am popping pills every day just to function.
*  So my doctor at the time suggested, what about medical marijuana?
*  It had become legal in our state a few years prior.
*  And you know, I thought, wow, okay, yeah, you know, I'm always one for a more natural
*  route.
*  I just...
*  So she started using weed on the recommendation of her doctor to help with the headaches.
*  And at first it was phenomenal.
*  I could, you know, take a couple of hits or take an edible and the migraine was gone.
*  And I thought, this is fantastic.
*  Why don't I take all these pills anymore and all this stuff?
*  And Jennifer found that using marijuana medically really helped her with her health problem.
*  She was using a couple times a week and that was enough.
*  It solved the issue right away.
*  And then...
*  About six months into it, I started getting stomach aches.
*  She starts to experience some nausea.
*  I started waking up nauseous every single morning.
*  I just was dry heaving and sometimes I would vomit and it just was...
*  And an employee at the marijuana dispensary that she used advised her to increase her
*  marijuana use.
*  I would say, we have really good luck with this one because it's what we give chemo patients.
*  And I'd say, all right, give it to me.
*  And eventually she was using the drug nearly every day.
*  And it would help me and I would feel better and I was okay to eat.
*  And then, you know, it would wear off and then it was a cycle that just kept going and
*  going.
*  But the nausea actually got worse.
*  She starts to get cycles of severe vomiting and stomach pain.
*  I was pretty much bedridden.
*  I mean, on a good day, I was just mildly nauseous.
*  On a bad day, I was, you know, on the bathroom floor, crying my eyes out, you know, just
*  totally desperate for help.
*  And it just went on and on and on.
*  She was often in immense pain and it was really scary to her.
*  But when she sought medical attention...
*  You know, they had no answers.
*  They said, well...
*  Doctor after doctor could not figure out what was wrong with her.
*  Then they started doing cat scans and stomach tests and, I mean, blood tests and all these
*  workups and, you know, you name it, I had it.
*  Over the course of three years, I went to 12 different doctors.
*  I went to including four different gastroenterologists.
*  I went to neurologists.
*  I went to internists.
*  I went to functional medicine doctors.
*  I did acupuncture.
*  I did restriction diets.
*  I gave up, you know, every food group for forever.
*  And I just kept getting sicker and sicker and sicker.
*  She gets all of these different diagnoses.
*  At one point, she actually has her gallbladder removed.
*  Oh my God.
*  And it was really discouraging because nothing was helping.
*  I really had some very dark days where I thought, you know, I'm going to die.
*  Because this is it for me.
*  I can't get out of bed, you know, and no one seems to know what to do.
*  And I don't, you know, this is it.
*  Then one day, June 16th, 2022, I will remember the day.
*  She's once again on the internet trying to find any possible cause for this pain that
*  she's in.
*  And you know, way down on the Google search pages, I saw a link to the Facebook page.
*  And she finds this Facebook group that is made up of people who are suffering from a
*  condition called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, known as CHS.
*  And it's the first time she has any inkling that the weed might be causing her pain.
*  And what exactly is CHS?
*  Well, it's really interesting, right?
*  Because marijuana is widely known for helping with nausea.
*  But in some cases, with certain chronic users, it can actually have the opposite effect.
*  We're talking about really severe nausea, severe vomiting, cycles of severe vomiting,
*  in which people are in so much pain that they actually use the term scromiting because they're
*  often screaming out in pain.
*  It's so awful.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yes.
*  And this is a relatively new syndrome.
*  It was first identified in 2004.
*  And basically, it's rise, like completely tracks with the rise in legalization and commercialization
*  and the change in these products.
*  And it's still quite a mystery.
*  They don't know why some chronic users get it and others don't.
*  And there's also this telltale sign to the syndrome that is also not understood.
*  And that's that hot water often relieves symptoms.
*  So people who develop the syndrome will often spend hour after hour in really, really hot
*  baths or showers, sometimes to the point where they burn themselves.
*  The cases can be really severe.
*  It can lead to extreme dehydration, seizures, kidney failure, and even cardiac arrest.
*  We found eight deaths linked to CHS.
*  Wow.
*  How common is this syndrome?
*  It's hard to say with certainty just how many people are suffering from CHS at this point.
*  Even 20 years after it was first identified, there's not a single diagnostic code for it.
*  So there's no uniform tracking of it in the medical system.
*  But what we heard from our interviews and surveys of doctors is that they're seeing
*  more and more of it.
*  And many describe it now as a common thing that is presenting in emergency departments.
*  One doctor referred to it as a bread and butter diagnostic.
*  Others said they see it every week, if not every day.
*  And there are also researchers who have estimated that as many as 30% of heavy users, regular
*  users of marijuana are experiencing some symptoms of the syndrome.
*  So that would mean an estimated six million people.
*  And Jennifer is one of those people, correct?
*  What happened to her?
*  So after finding the Facebook group and realizing what's going on.
*  And you know, I had taken my last edible at nine o'clock that morning, and this was at
*  nine thirty when I found the page.
*  I said, that's it.
*  I'm done.
*  There's even a tiny, tiny, minuscule chance that this is it.
*  You know, I'm done.
*  Let's see what happens.
*  She decides to quit marijuana on the spot.
*  And that leads to a period of withdrawal that lasts for about two months.
*  And I just got better and better from that.
*  And I mean, it's been two years and I'm fine.
*  And after that, she's been totally fine.
*  That is wild.
*  I mean.
*  And during this period of withdrawal, she sees yet another specialist who confirms that she
*  did indeed have CHS and actually told Jennifer that she was seeing multiple cases of the
*  syndrome every week.
*  You mentioned before that there were several potential marijuana related health issues
*  you were looking into with those surveys.
*  What else did you find?
*  So another significant harm that we identified that is very concerning is the relationship
*  between marijuana and psychosis.
*  And one of the ways that that plays out is marijuana causing a temporary psychotic episode
*  or symptoms, paranoia, hallucinations.
*  And that can happen to all different kinds of people, people of different ages, chronic
*  users of marijuana or first time users of marijuana, people who are otherwise at risk
*  for experiencing psychosis or have no other risk factors at all.
*  And one of the people that I spoke to who had experienced this.
*  Hi, is this Javante?
*  Yes, it is.
*  Hi, this is Megan.
*  Is a man named Javante Hill who lives in Colorado and tried marijuana at the suggestion of his
*  girlfriend.
*  He was a recent Navy veteran with PTSD, anxiety and depression.
*  And his girlfriend was an occasional marijuana user and told him that it could be a nice
*  way to chill out.
*  And it was honestly to wean off, like, you know, go from alcohol to this one because
*  the media around we was that is a much safer alternative.
*  You know, you don't wake up hungover.
*  So one night, and this was just his second time using it, he took a bong hit.
*  And then literally after 10 minutes, I started to have almost like severe terremolia.
*  And ended up totally paranoid and hallucinating.
*  He said it was like he was in hell with devils.
*  Oh my god.
*  His girlfriend, Eva Zamora, who I also spoke with, was there trying to comfort him, but
*  he didn't recognize her.
*  Wow.
*  And in the midst of this, their dog started fighting.
*  And he ended up getting his gun.
*  And he looked like he was scared.
*  But he had the gun up and he took some shots.
*  And as soon as that happened, I ran.
*  And shooting and killing one of the dogs and actually shooting and injuring his girlfriend,
*  Eva.
*  He had no idea that this was a risk or even a possibility when he tried that marijuana.
*  Nothing like this had ever happened to him before.
*  He had no history of psychosis.
*  He had no history of domestic violence.
*  After the incident, he was diagnosed with drug induced hallucinations.
*  And he ended up pleading guilty to animal cruelty and assault charges.
*  And he's actually suing the dispensary chain, claiming it failed to warn him about the risk
*  of psychosis.
*  And that type of temporary psychosis caused by marijuana is something that doctors are
*  seeing across the country.
*  In our interviews and in our surveys of doctors, they said that they were seeing more and more
*  patients with those kind of experiences.
*  Wow.
*  And you said that that kind of psychosis was temporary.
*  But are there any other longer term mental health implications?
*  So marijuana can affect brain development, particularly during the critical period of
*  adolescence, which actually goes up through age 25.
*  And this is also the period when chronic psychotic disorders like schizophrenia typically emerge.
*  And there's growing evidence that marijuana use can contribute to the development of those
*  psychotic disorders.
*  Recent studies showed that the more potent the cannabis, the more frequent the use, and
*  the earlier the age of consuming, the greater the risk.
*  And to be clear, this isn't like a clear cut black and white cause and effect relationship
*  between marijuana and chronic psychotic disorders.
*  One researcher that I talked to, a professor at Yale University, who's paid a lot of attention
*  to this issue, actually compared it to cigarette smoking and lung cancer.
*  Not everybody who smokes cigarettes gets lung cancer, not everybody who has lung cancer
*  smokes cigarettes.
*  But we know after decades that there's a strong association between the two.
*  And as he put it, the same goes for marijuana use and these chronic psychotic disorders.
*  And doctors told us that they are seeing more and more of these chronic psychotic disorders
*  in which they believe cannabis played a role.
*  You know, Megan, we've talked about a few of these potentially awful side effects from
*  marijuana use, like addiction, the bouts of vomiting, psychosis, and just longer term
*  mental health effects.
*  And what strikes me is that all of this stuff really runs counter to the narrative that
*  I imagine a lot of people have about marijuana, which is that it's relatively safe.
*  Yeah, listen, our public understanding of this drug hasn't kept pace with the transformation
*  of it and this new commercial industry and these shifts in how people are using it.
*  And I know at least from many of the people who have experienced harms from marijuana,
*  some of these harms that we've discussed, that when they tried to talk about it, they
*  often ran into not just skepticism, but also sometimes downright hostility.
*  Yeah, actually, you're reminding me, I noticed that when the Times posted your story on Instagram,
*  there was this comment from the comedian Eric Andre, and he said something like, whose
*  side are you on?
*  And it made me wonder how broadly you felt that sentiment.
*  Like, after all this work to increase access to marijuana, were people not receptive to
*  hearing that it might be bad for you?
*  You know, I actually saw that comment as well, Rachel, that caught my eye.
*  But I want to be very clear about what else we found in our reporting, which is that the
*  majority of the doctors that we talked to support the legalization of marijuana.
*  Even the majority of people that we interviewed and surveyed who had been harmed by marijuana,
*  none of them were saying like, this is categorically a bad drug and should not be made available.
*  What we heard time and again is that the way that legalization and commercialization is
*  playing out in this country is flawed, that the government and the medical system need
*  to be doing more to track the health effects of marijuana.
*  They need to be doing more to document that.
*  And they need to also be communicating that to consumers, that these consumers have a
*  right to know about the associations with psychosis.
*  They have a right to know about the risk of this becoming addictive.
*  They have the right to know about CHS.
*  Jennifer Macaluso, for example, said, if I had known that CHS existed, if that had been
*  on a warning label, I wouldn't have increased my use of the drug when I started experiencing
*  symptoms.
*  And so I think that the uniform message that came out of this reporting was there needs
*  to be better oversight, there needs to be better protections, and there needs to be
*  better information.
*  Megan, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  I am grateful to be back here in Lebanon, but I have to admit that I am saddened to
*  bear witness to the pain of its people and what they're experiencing.
*  In Lebanon on Monday, a top U.S. official said that the growing conflict between Israel
*  and Hezbollah has spun out of control, and he outlined a proposal to bring it to an end.
*  And I want to be very, very clear.
*  Tying Lebanon's future to other conflicts in the region was not and is not in the interest
*  of the Lebanese people.
*  The official, the American diplomat Amos Hoxstein, called on both sides to abide by a UN resolution
*  reached back in 2006 that would require Israel to withdraw its troops from Lebanon and for
*  Hezbollah to be disarmed along Lebanon's border with Israel.
*  Israel's recent military operations against Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed group that has
*  launched thousands of rockets into Israel, has caused a humanitarian crisis in Lebanon
*  that has displaced about a fifth of the country's population.
