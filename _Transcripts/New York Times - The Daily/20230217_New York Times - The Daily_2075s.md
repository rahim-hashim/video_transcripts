Video Description: This episode contains descriptions of violence and injury. 


In September, protests began in Iran over the death of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, at the hands of the government. The demonstrations have since intensified, as has the government’s response, with thousands arrested and a terrifying campaign of public executions underway.


Today, Iranians who have taken part in the demonstrations tell us — in their own words — why they are willing to brave such severe punishments to help bring about change.


Guest: Cora Engelbrecht (https://www.nytimes.com/by/cora-engelbrecht?smid=pc-thedaily) , an international reporter for The New York Times.

# Arrests, Executions and the Iranian Protesters Who Refuse to Give Up
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=0.0s)]
*  In Iran, the massive demonstrations that began in September over the death of a young woman [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=11.8s)]
*  at the hands of the government intensified in the months that followed, with protesters [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  calling for an end to the Islamic regime. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Fahsa Amini was arrested for not wearing what they said was correct hijab. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=27.0s)]
*  Now women and men have spilled into the streets, attacking authoritarian symbols, chanting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=33.12s)]
*  death to the dictator. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=38.6s)]
*  The regime, for its part, hit back, arresting thousands of protesters and undertaking a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=40.24s)]
*  terrifying campaign of public executions. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=46.08s)]
*  Iran has carried out its first known execution of a protester. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=49.64s)]
*  A second protester has been executed by hanging. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=53.16s)]
*  Iran once again has executed two protesters. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=56.56s)]
*  The two men were identified as Mohammed Mehdi Karami and Syed Mohammed Hosseini. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=59.28s)]
*  Today, my colleague Cora Engelbrecht on who is protesting in Iran and what they say about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=64.68s)]
*  why they're willing to risk their lives to do it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=71.08s)]
*  It's Friday, January 27th. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=80.88s)]
*  Cora, you've been covering the protests in Iran since September. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=86.56s)]
*  And it's been a while since we've talked about them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  In fact, it has been since September. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=96.44s)]
*  So catch us up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=98.84s)]
*  What has been happening in Iran? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=101.28s)]
*  The protests in Iran have been going on for about four months now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=103.68s)]
*  And in the first few months, we saw a huge escalation in the demonstrations that were [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=107.84s)]
*  across scores of cities all over the country. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=113.9s)]
*  And the government in response deployed this incredibly brutal crackdown using repressive [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=117.22s)]
*  tactics, violence, mass arrests, now executions to instill this culture of fear and eliminate [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=124.7s)]
*  any signs of dissent. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=133.02s)]
*  So we really wanted to understand and get a clearer picture of what was going on on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=135.3s)]
*  from people who were in the streets living through these demonstrations. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=140.62s)]
*  But we had a real problem, which is that we weren't there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=145.62s)]
*  We don't have anyone in the country right now. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  Like literally physically, you guys were not in Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  No, we're not in Iran. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=153.86s)]
*  It's actually been years since the New York Times has been able to have a correspondent [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=155.82s)]
*  work inside the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=159.46s)]
*  This is mostly because the atmosphere is extremely hostile to foreign news media organizations. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=161.62s)]
*  These are very at risk of harassment, detention, or worse. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=169.82s)]
*  And it is incredibly difficult to reach people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=175.1s)]
*  Of course, this is all by design by the authorities who are clamping down on all conversations [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=178.54s)]
*  surrounding what's happening in the country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=183.7s)]
*  They're actively curbing the spread of information with widespread internet blackouts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=186.3s)]
*  And they're threatening protesters and their families that any interviews with media, especially [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=192.46s)]
*  foreign media, could lead to more pressure and more severe sentences. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=197.26s)]
*  Okay, so what did you do? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=202.7s)]
*  Like how do you approach this as a reporting mission? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=205.62s)]
*  At the start of the protests, we were relying heavily on videos that were emerging on social [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=208.78s)]
*  media, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=215.18s)]
*  They were showing us extraordinarily vivid scenes from the demonstrations on the streets [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=219.38s)]
*  of women burning their hijabs, cutting their hair, but also giving us a sense of the violence [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=226.34s)]
*  that was taking place and what these protesters were up against. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=236.34s)]
*  And so each morning I'm pouring through these videos and then on September 30th, this series [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=244.34s)]
*  of especially violent, bloody images begin to emerge from this city called Zahedan, which [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=251.78s)]
*  is in the southeastern corner of Iran. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  These were just fragmented clips, but they gave me this glimpse into this horrific scene [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=264.34s)]
*  that seemed to be unfolding outside a huge prayer complex in the city. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=274.32s)]
*  They needed to be verified, they needed to be pieced together. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=280.42s)]
*  So we set about finding eyewitnesses that could help us, which proved to be very difficult. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=283.46000000000004s)]
*  But eventually there were two rights groups, they were able to connect me and my colleague [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=292.42s)]
*  Neelu Tugbrizi to eyewitnesses and relatives of victims, even a medic who had treated a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=296.98s)]
*  lot of people that day. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  These people were difficult to pin down, they would lose service constantly, they were under [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=310.1s)]
*  a lot of pressure because there were arrests that were taking place across the entire city. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  And it took about two weeks after this had all happened before we were able to start [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=319.86s)]
*  piecing together a real picture of what had gone down. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  They told me on this day a small group of 10 to 15 worshippers left the prayer complex [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=329.62s)]
*  before Friday prayers had completed to confront security officers that were stationed at this [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=340.44s)]
*  police station across the street from the prayer complex. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=346.28s)]
*  They were coming out in solidarity with the nationwide demonstrations, but also to protest [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=352.84s)]
*  this alleged rape of a young girl by a police officer in another city in the region. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=358.56s)]
*  So the crowd starts growing, they start chanting anti-government slogans and hurling rocks. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=369.56s)]
*  And they are met with live bullets and tear gas, which follows them back into the prayer [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=375.8s)]
*  complex where hundreds of people are still peacefully praying. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=389.16s)]
*  One especially searing video showed worshippers who still had their heads bowed in prayer [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=396.8s)]
*  as gunfire can be heard raining down in the background. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=403.16s)]
*  Over the course of the next few hours, somewhere between 66 to 96 people were killed. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=410.76000000000005s)]
*  It was certainly the most lethal government action we had seen since the protests began [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  and it came to be known as Bloody Friday. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=424.44000000000005s)]
*  This window that we had into this day in Zahedan, it was incredibly violent. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=433.8s)]
*  In fact, the most lethal that we've seen over the course of the demonstrations. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=441.56s)]
*  But there were other forms of violence that were part of this wave of repression. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=446.92s)]
*  Casualties were mounting across the country as protesters continued to clash with security [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=452.56s)]
*  forces. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=457.56s)]
*  And we were hearing about more and more injuries. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  There were images emerging on social media that showed protesters with these injuries [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=462.48s)]
*  from rubber bullets and metal pellets that security forces were using in the streets [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=467.8s)]
*  to dispel crowds. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=473.88s)]
*  But again, we didn't have anyone on the ground who could corroborate what was going on. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=476.48s)]
*  We didn't have clear visibility. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=481.24s)]
*  So it became crucial to reach people who were actually experiencing this level of violence [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=483.68s)]
*  and could help us tell a definitive story about what was happening, similar to what [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=490.16s)]
*  we did in Zahedan. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=494.76s)]
*  And eventually I found someone. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=496.96s)]
*  Hello? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=499.28s)]
*  Hello? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=500.28s)]
*  How are you, Kara? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=501.28s)]
*  Saman, how are you? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=502.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=503.28s)]
*  How are you too? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=504.28s)]
*  I'm okay. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=505.28s)]
*  I'm okay. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=506.28s)]
*  His nickname is Saman. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=507.28s)]
*  Out of concern for his safety, we're not sharing his real name or his location. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=509.04s)]
*  Sorry for my language. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=514.36s)]
*  No worries. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=515.36s)]
*  My English is not perfect. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=516.36s)]
*  Your English is very good. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=519.36s)]
*  So Kor, who is Saman and what does he tell you? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=521.72s)]
*  I was a protester. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=524.96s)]
*  I just was a protester. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=526.32s)]
*  And we want my human rights, just my rights. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=529.2s)]
*  Saman is a protester who started going out to the streets in the early days of the demonstrations [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=535.16s)]
*  in Tehran. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=542.0s)]
*  We don't want Iranian regime, Islamic regime and mullahs. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=543.52s)]
*  And we was in the streets and telling them we don't want Islamic regime. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=549.64s)]
*  He tells me about one particular day where he was preparing to go to the protests at [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=560.28s)]
*  And he was on his motorbike approaching the square and a security officer was standing [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=567.12s)]
*  on the corner of the square. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=575.7199999999999s)]
*  And actually, he told me that they locked eyes and the security officer raised his gun [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=577.4799999999999s)]
*  from a close distance and aimed at his head. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=583.8s)]
*  And they shot in my eye from near distance. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=588.28s)]
*  A rubber bullet went right into his eye. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=592.52s)]
*  He believes the security officer must have recognized him as one of the frontline activists [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=596.92s)]
*  who had been returning here night after night. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=606.12s)]
*  Yes, I knew his face. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=609.24s)]
*  So he cupped his hand to this mutilated eye. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=612.52s)]
*  He was afraid that it was going to fall out of its socket. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=617.76s)]
*  And he drove himself to a hospital. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=620.04s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=623.36s)]
*  He was finally admitted to a government run eye hospital called Farabi. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=624.36s)]
*  And when he gets there, he's taken to this ward that is flooded with cases that are just [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=630.4s)]
*  like his. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=637.04s)]
*  One witness saw a four year old girl roaming the halls with a bandaged eye. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=639.28s)]
*  A protester next to Saman is waiting to have eye surgery. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=645.08s)]
*  His body is just completely riddled with these metal pellets. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=649.22s)]
*  And they're all here in the same ward. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=654.86s)]
*  So what are you thinking at this point in his telling of the story, Cora? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=660.94s)]
*  Like all of these people in this hospital, many of whom have eye injuries, like was this [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=665.52s)]
*  an intentional thing that the government was doing? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=672.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's an immediate question I had. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=675.22s)]
*  I started reaching out to government run facilities across the country to try and understand [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=678.78s)]
*  what was happening in these different eye wards. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=685.8399999999999s)]
*  I didn't hear anything, unsurprisingly, in response to all these calls. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=689.42s)]
*  But slowly, I did start hearing back from doctors on WhatsApp. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=695.78s)]
*  They started sending me individually medical documents, CT scans that painted a fuller [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=701.16s)]
*  picture of these wards that were really deluged with cases of severe eye injuries. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=707.14s)]
*  Doctors in three main hospitals across Tehran ended up estimating for me that they had seen [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=714.9399999999999s)]
*  at least 500 of these injuries since the start of the protests. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=723.02s)]
*  Okay, Saman is one of hundreds of people who've been injured just like this. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=728.1s)]
*  He's shot in the eye. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=732.54s)]
*  He finally makes it to a hospital. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=734.0s)]
*  What happens? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=736.34s)]
*  So when he gets to this ward that's flooded with like injuries, he's immediately told [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=737.62s)]
*  by two nurses that the ward is being patrolled by security officers. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=744.4200000000001s)]
*  There was policemen in hospital. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=750.98s)]
*  There was policemen, two officers looking for protesters. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=754.1s)]
*  And they asking you about what happened for your face. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=760.5s)]
*  And that there are protesters there who have been arrested after surgery. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=766.34s)]
*  In hospital, one of the nurse told me, take care. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=771.54s)]
*  They looking for you. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=777.3s)]
*  I was in another room and I heard from colidor. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=779.34s)]
*  Where is bed? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=785.42s)]
*  25. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=787.98s)]
*  My bed number was 25. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=788.98s)]
*  He learns from these nurses on his floor that some of the wounded are being arrested. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=792.18s)]
*  He says he also overhears an officer soon after ask about his bed number from the hallway [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  in this waiting room that he's in. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  I later find out that this is another common tactic that's happening in hospitals across [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=807.5s)]
*  the country, especially in the eye wards because if you arrive with this injury, you're pretty [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=812.9399999999999s)]
*  easily identified as someone who has participated in the movement. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=818.6600000000001s)]
*  So does he get out? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=822.58s)]
*  So Saman's mother who lives outside of the country, she has actually flown back to Tehran [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=824.94s)]
*  as soon as she gets the news that her son has been injured. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=831.1s)]
*  She shows up to this hospital as well. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=835.12s)]
*  And with the help of a friend is able to spirit away her son from the hospital still in his [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=838.3000000000001s)]
*  hospital gown. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=845.32s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=846.82s)]
*  I was able to speak with her as well and she told me she was terrified. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=848.22s)]
*  Her son now has evidence of his participation in these demonstrations emblazoned on his [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=852.02s)]
*  face. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=858.14s)]
*  I saw in his Instagram and everywhere my photos was everywhere. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=859.14s)]
*  My bloody photos was everywhere. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=866.38s)]
*  And pictures of his injuries are apparently everywhere circulating on social media. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=869.34s)]
*  I was afraid for recognizing my face. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=874.7s)]
*  And at that time, I decided to leave country. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=881.26s)]
*  And within a few days, the two of them managed to get on a plane and flee the country. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=887.1s)]
*  If I didn't run from Iran, 100% they killed me. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=893.1s)]
*  If they're catching me, if they arrested me, 100% I'm sure they execute me. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=902.34s)]
*  And he had reason to be so afraid because this was all happening against this backdrop [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=919.34s)]
*  of mass arrests that were taking place since the start of the demonstrations, which was [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=924.74s)]
*  something else that I wanted to understand more clearly. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=929.9399999999999s)]
*  So I started looking for someone who could tell me what this was like firsthand. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=932.98s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=946.18s)]
*  So Cora, Saman leaves the country because he's afraid of getting arrested and potentially [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=959.78s)]
*  even getting executed. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=967.86s)]
*  And you said that made you really want to find protesters who'd actually been arrested [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=970.18s)]
*  to really get a sense of what was happening in this moment in Iran. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=975.74s)]
*  So what'd you do? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=980.78s)]
*  Yeah, this seemed incredibly important to get our eyes on this because it was happening [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=982.18s)]
*  to so many people at this point. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=986.4599999999999s)]
*  The mass arrests started at the start of the demonstrations. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=988.4599999999999s)]
*  By mid-November, 14,000 people had been arrested by security forces. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=992.42s)]
*  It felt like a huge tactic that the government was using to get people off of the streets, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=998.3s)]
*  but also to scare a lot of the young kids that were coming out and were organizing these [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1002.9799999999999s)]
*  demonstrations from their universities, from their high schools. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1008.66s)]
*  So I started looking for protesters who had been arrested. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1012.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1018.14s)]
*  And how'd you go about that? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1019.14s)]
*  The judicial system in Iran is notoriously murky. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1020.74s)]
*  And there's an entire network of former prisoners, activists, journalists and lawyers outside [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1025.1399999999999s)]
*  of the country who have actually for years made it their work to track prisoners as they're [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1032.54s)]
*  arrested, as they're navigating the judicial system. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1038.74s)]
*  And I had been in touch with them about these numbers. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1043.02s)]
*  So I reached out to them to see if they knew anyone who would speak to me. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1048.06s)]
*  And they eventually put me in touch with someone. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1052.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1055.6599999999999s)]
*  I just, I do want to make sure that, you know, you feel safe about this. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1056.6599999999999s)]
*  And I am curious to know why you've decided to speak at this moment. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1063.8999999999999s)]
*  Well, the security risks are faced at everyone, including me too. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1070.34s)]
*  But I'm alive to speak out. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1074.8999999999999s)]
*  To protect his identity, we're going to call him S. And the voice you'll hear is that of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1077.82s)]
*  a translator. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1082.06s)]
*  If I do not speak out about my experiences and what's happening around me, then what's [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1083.06s)]
*  the use? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1088.06s)]
*  Then it will be just like a prison. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1089.06s)]
*  So that's why I've decided to speak. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1090.6599999999999s)]
*  And he essentially told me he was arrested for participating in the protests. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1094.74s)]
*  So they came at 1 a.m. on that night. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1099.86s)]
*  Me and my mother, we were actually awake. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1106.98s)]
*  My father was asleep. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1109.02s)]
*  They knocked on the door. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1111.1s)]
*  Very harsh. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1113.1s)]
*  My father woke up. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1114.94s)]
*  He opened the door. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1117.14s)]
*  They came in. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1118.64s)]
*  It was people from the Ministry of Intelligence. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1121.1s)]
*  And they had no arrest warrant. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1125.94s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1128.46s)]
*  Only one sentence came out of their mouth about what I had done that I was being arrested [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1129.46s)]
*  for. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1135.38s)]
*  They said that I have published a call for protest, but actually I had not. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1136.66s)]
*  They were very much disrespectful in their behavior, in their talking, in their shouting. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1144.22s)]
*  And they took me by force into the car. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1150.66s)]
*  And they took my phone and they said, what's your password? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1157.8200000000002s)]
*  I refused to give them my password. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1160.8200000000002s)]
*  And then they started hitting me. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1164.9s)]
*  They beat me. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1169.3000000000002s)]
*  And they basically did not abide by any law while they were taking me into detention. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1171.7s)]
*  But wait, if he was arrested, how are you talking to him now? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1182.3000000000002s)]
*  He's out on bail now, which is something the government actually does pretty frequently. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1186.18s)]
*  They are known to arrest protesters, release them on bail so that these charges are hanging [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1191.9s)]
*  over them. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1198.22s)]
*  And it helps them keep people off of the streets, but also out of the prisons if they're needing [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1199.94s)]
*  to move lots of people through, which is what they've been doing. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1204.8400000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1208.5800000000002s)]
*  So S has been arrested and he's out on bail, just waiting to see what happens. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1209.5800000000002s)]
*  Tell me about him. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1215.42s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1216.42s)]
*  I'd like to ask you some questions just about your own story. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1217.94s)]
*  If you can just tell us whatever you feel comfortable sharing, what can you tell us [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1223.78s)]
*  about your background before this year? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1228.3600000000001s)]
*  I was born in Tehran. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1231.54s)]
*  I was grown up in a religious family. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1233.46s)]
*  I studied my elementary, secondary, and high school in Tehran. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1236.9s)]
*  We can't share too many details about this person because we're trying to keep him safe, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1243.54s)]
*  but what I can tell you is that he is certainly young. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1249.06s)]
*  Since I was a kid, I was interested in reading books, studying and reading. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1252.6200000000001s)]
*  It was one of my main interests. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1256.9s)]
*  And like a lot of people his age and his generation, he had a sort of political awakening while [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1260.5s)]
*  he was in school. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1268.26s)]
*  And I started to read more and learn more about what was happening around me in Iran. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1269.94s)]
*  And that developed my knowledge and my political understanding of my country. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1275.78s)]
*  So when the protests start in mid-September, he's there immediately. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1281.8s)]
*  He's on the streets and soon finds himself in the crosshairs of the government and taken [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1285.94s)]
*  to prison. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1291.78s)]
*  And what does he tell you about prison? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1293.6200000000001s)]
*  He was taken to a notorious prison in Tehran, the country's capital. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1296.74s)]
*  It's called Evin Prison. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1301.02s)]
*  It houses hundreds of political dissidents, student activists, anyone who has posed some [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1303.42s)]
*  sort of challenge to the regime. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1308.94s)]
*  I was detained at ward 241 for about 21 days, almost three weeks. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1310.94s)]
*  He described in detail his experience in one particular ward called 241, which I learned [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1318.22s)]
*  is where they were bringing a lot of these protesters. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1325.58s)]
*  I was constantly being interrogated. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1328.8999999999999s)]
*  At times I was kept at the solitary confinement. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1331.8999999999999s)]
*  And some of these prisoners faced interrogations. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1335.6999999999998s)]
*  So the arrestee would be interrogated either every day or once in a few days. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1338.6999999999998s)]
*  The whole process happens while the prisoner has been blindfolded. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1344.62s)]
*  All the movings, all the interrogations, everything like that. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1348.02s)]
*  He told me that he was not personally mistreated during these interrogations, but that he heard [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1352.06s)]
*  plenty of other protesters through the walls of this ward who were under much more pressure. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1360.4199999999998s)]
*  My interrogations were mainly questions and answers. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1368.1799999999998s)]
*  But while I was in downstairs, I heard with my own ears, interrogators were shouting at [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1372.3s)]
*  prisoners and they were humiliating them. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1378.86s)]
*  And I heard what sounded like abuse. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1381.98s)]
*  It was a terrorizing atmosphere down there. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1385.18s)]
*  And so while S is being held in there, the Iranian government starts rolling out these [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1391.82s)]
*  trials for prisoners. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1397.14s)]
*  What are trials like in Iran? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1400.34s)]
*  Many of these trials are not open to the public, particularly the ones that are handled by [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1402.46s)]
*  the Revolutionary Court. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1407.78s)]
*  The defendants are often represented by government-appointed lawyers. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1409.98s)]
*  Evidence is shoddy at best and often includes confessions which are made under pressure [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1414.54s)]
*  or torture. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1420.74s)]
*  And so in November, the government starts issuing these harsh sentences and some protesters [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1426.5s)]
*  are sentenced to death. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1433.98s)]
*  One of the first protesters to receive the death sentence was a man named Mohsen Shaqari. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1439.46s)]
*  He was accused of a number of things, including blocking a road, threatening public safety, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1445.82s)]
*  the most important, attacking a member of the Besiege, which is a volunteer militia [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1452.6200000000001s)]
*  operating under the government. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1456.58s)]
*  So I got to know Mohsen from the general section of ward 241. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1459.88s)]
*  It turns out that during his time in prison, S has actually crossed paths with Mohsen. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1467.3799999999999s)]
*  How did he describe him? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1476.22s)]
*  He was a young man. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1477.6399999999999s)]
*  He was a quiet man at the age of 23 years old with very little hair on his head. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1479.68s)]
*  He said he was quiet, that he was generous. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1486.76s)]
*  And sometimes we would have very short conversations together. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1490.86s)]
*  Most of his conversations were about his interests, his hobbies, the games that he [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1495.64s)]
*  used to play as a kid, as a young teenager. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1500.92s)]
*  And he was hoping that once he was going out, he would be starting to play new games. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1504.5200000000002s)]
*  And that he had a lot of hopes for his sentence being lessened and for his future once he [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1512.8400000000001s)]
*  got out of prison. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1520.16s)]
*  And we saw the way he behaved himself. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1521.5200000000002s)]
*  This person was a nice human being. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1524.4s)]
*  Sometimes when they were bringing food into the section and the food would not be enough [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1527.76s)]
*  for everyone, I saw myself that Mohsen shared his food, a very small portion that would [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1532.0400000000002s)]
*  not feed one person. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1538.02s)]
*  He would share it with other inmates. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1539.24s)]
*  So after 21 days of being in prison, S is eventually released on bail. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1542.0s)]
*  So I was released, but Mohsen remained there. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1547.8000000000002s)]
*  And on December 8th, Mohsen Shaqari becomes the first known protester to be executed. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1551.64s)]
*  Less than three weeks after his sentence, he was hanged to death. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1558.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh, Mohsen! [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1561.64s)]
*  Later in that day, there's an excruciating video that starts circulating on social media [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1562.64s)]
*  of a woman who's said to be Mohsen's mother. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1571.6000000000001s)]
*  Out in the streets, screaming his name. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1575.92s)]
*  I can basically summarize the feelings and the sentiments after Mohsen's execution in [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1595.8000000000002s)]
*  In a number of words, anger. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1603.16s)]
*  What we've seen is really a wave of videos that purport to show fresh protests inside [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1608.3600000000001s)]
*  Iran. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1613.56s)]
*  Sorrow. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1615.56s)]
*  Residents silently march through the town. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1617.56s)]
*  The police watch from the side. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1620.08s)]
*  But mainly anger among all the people that I knew, every people that they also used to [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1622.08s)]
*  know Mohsen. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1626.72s)]
*  In one of the videos, you can hear the protesters chanting, death to the dictator, death to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1629.04s)]
*  the dictator. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1632.6000000000001s)]
*  The execution of protesters is unlikely to quell this rebellion. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1637.8s)]
*  What will happen? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1646.72s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1647.72s)]
*  The clerics who run Iran have been rattled by public displays of defiance, but they won't [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1650.56s)]
*  give way without a fight. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1656.76s)]
*  We are not sure about tomorrow. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1661.28s)]
*  So we can't say what will exactly follow. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1665.16s)]
*  But one thing that is for sure is that this will continue. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1668.88s)]
*  So, Quora, what's happening right now in Iran? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1673.88s)]
*  So far, there have been four executions that we know of, all men, three in their early [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1686.12s)]
*  20s, including Shaqqari, and one in his late 30s. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1691.44s)]
*  There are more executions that are expected. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1696.16s)]
*  Thousands have been arrested, hundreds have been killed. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1699.52s)]
*  And as far as the movement is concerned, we're now four months into the protests and the [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1702.8799999999999s)]
*  demonstrations have essentially quieted. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1708.76s)]
*  Quieted? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1712.28s)]
*  So are the protests over? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1713.82s)]
*  It's really too soon to tell. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1715.62s)]
*  On the face of it, it looks like this could be a win for the government. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1717.9399999999998s)]
*  The streets look very different right now. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1723.78s)]
*  At the height of the movement, we were seeing dozens of protests a day and now there are [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1726.5s)]
*  only a handful. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1730.22s)]
*  The university campuses, which were the important hubs for sustaining the movement, they're [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1733.7s)]
*  now being heavily surveilled and policed. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1740.58s)]
*  And people can't afford to stay out in the streets. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1744.1799999999998s)]
*  Inflation, which was already high, has gotten worse over the course of the demonstrations. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1747.3799999999999s)]
*  The currency has plummeted since September. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1752.98s)]
*  It's all putting people under even more stress. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1756.02s)]
*  So it does seem like for now, the climate of fear is working. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1758.9399999999998s)]
*  We're definitely not seeing a full acceptance from the Iranian population. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1766.26s)]
*  There are a lot of Iranians that are still incredibly upset with the regime. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1774.3799999999999s)]
*  They insist that the movement lives on, that the pressure from the government has not extinguished [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1780.82s)]
*  their anger. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1787.1s)]
*  If anything, the executions have totally inflamed it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1788.1s)]
*  And we are seeing groups that are showing up to prisons where protesters are on death [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1791.66s)]
*  row to protest the executions. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1796.8600000000001s)]
*  Dismissing the hijab law is still a criminal offense in Iran, but women throughout the [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1802.98s)]
*  country, especially in the capital Tehran, they're refusing to cover their hair. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1808.8200000000002s)]
*  So it seems no matter what happens with the protests, no matter how they're resolved, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1815.94s)]
*  they seem to have fundamentally shaped the relationship between the Iranian government [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1822.6200000000001s)]
*  and its people. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1829.9s)]
*  Cora, thank you. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1835.3400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1836.3400000000001s)]
*  When fighting a totalitarian state, there will always be fear, but we have decided to [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1837.34s)]
*  face it. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbmk9nK-pY&t=1850.02s)]
