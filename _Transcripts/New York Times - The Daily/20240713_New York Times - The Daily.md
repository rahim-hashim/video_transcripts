# 'The Interview' Robert Putnam Knows Why You’re Lonely
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZ4Po4vMAQ)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro.
*  This isn't going to come as a newsflash. Things feel fragile in America. And there is a broad
*  consensus across parties and demographics that we are struggling to come together and
*  face our many challenges. Which is why, when I heard about a new documentary about the
*  Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam, I knew I wanted to talk to him.
*  Nearly three decades ago, Putnam became something pretty rare. A celebrity academic. In 1995,
*  he published a groundbreaking paper called Bowling Alone, America's Declining Social
*  Capital. In it, he used data from the previous few decades to prove that America was transforming
*  from a nation of joiners to a nation of loners. We were going to church less, joining clubs
*  at declining rates. And he warned that as a result, we were losing trust in our fellow
*  Americans and our institutions. That paper caught the attention of then President Bill
*  Clinton and before long, regular people couldn't stop talking about it either. Putnam expanded
*  it into a bestselling book a few years later. And for a moment, it seemed like his work
*  might pull us back from this isolation highway we were all on. We all know how that story
*  unfolded. Putnam's now 83. And he's watched as we've become more divided, more lonely
*  and less confident about the way forward than ever before, even as the stakes only get higher.
*  Here's my conversation with Robert Putnam.
*  Dr. Putnam, your work is all about connection. So I'm wondering first, can you describe your
*  own social life? I mean, what clubs are you in?
*  That's a really embarrassing question. I write about and talk about the importance of connections,
*  of social capital, which is my jargon for connections and trust and so on. But my wife
*  actually does it. She is actually the one who joins everything, who has been a tutor
*  and a teacher and a terrific mother and an even better grandmother. We've got two kids
*  and seven grandchildren. And in the long run, her work is going to have a longer half life
*  than mine. I'm not just being modest because those kids are going to be around long after
*  people have forgotten anything about this Putnam, the writer and author.
*  So that's a long way of saying not many clubs, am I right?
*  Right. When I was a kid, I joined everything. There's a picture of my high school yearbook
*  and basically there's nothing in my high school that I did not join, band and chorus and debate
*  and even football and on and on. But as I've gotten older, I've gotten, it's hard to go
*  to club meetings when you're on the road all the time. And I am. That's the sad fact.
*  That's interesting to me, because you're grappling with, I think, something that we all grapple
*  with, which is how harried our lives are, how hard it is to actually find meaningful
*  connection. And a big part of why I was interested in having this conversation with you is that
*  when it comes to social connection, things feel bad right now. Do things feel bad to
*  you too?
*  Oh, sure. I think we're at a really important turning point in American history. Of course,
*  American history is full of turning points, but this is a pretty important one. What I
*  wrote in Bowling Alone is even more relevant now. Why? Because what we've seen over the
*  last 25 years since the book was published is a deepening and intensifying of that trend.
*  We become more socially isolated and we can see it in every facet of our lives. We can
*  see it in the Surgeon General's talk about loneliness. And he's been talking about it
*  relatively recently, and he's talking about the psychological state of being lonely. That's
*  in Bowling Alone, the fact that people were becoming more and more socially isolated.
*  And the social isolation leads to lots of bad things. We're seeing it right now. Let
*  me give you a particular example. Social isolation is really bad. Well, it's bad for your health.
*  That's part of the story of the book. But it's really bad for the country because people
*  who are isolated, and especially young men who are isolated, are vulnerable to the appeals
*  of some false community. That was true, and I can cite chapter and verse on this. Eager
*  recruits to the Nazi party in the 1930s were lonely, young German men. And it's not an
*  accident that the people who are most attractive today to white nationalist violence are lonely,
*  young, white men. Loneliness is bad for your health, but it's also bad for the health of
*  the people around you. Does that make sense?
*  It does. I want to understand a little bit about the terms that you use for how you describe
*  this. You distinguish between two types of social capital, right? There's bonding social
*  capital and there's bridging social capital.
*  Exactly.
*  Can you explain that distinction?
*  Sure. Ties that link you to people like yourself are called bonding social capital. That's
*  just the way the word is used. So my ties to other elderly male, white Jewish professors,
*  that's my bonding social capital. And bridging social capital are your ties to people unlike
*  yourself. So my ties to people of a different generation or a different gender or a different
*  religion or a different politics, that's my bridging social capital. I'm not saying bridging
*  good, bonding bad, because if you get sick, the people who bring you chicken soup are
*  likely to reflect your bonding social capital. But I am saying that in a diverse society
*  like ours, we need a lot of bridging social capital. And some forms of bonding social
*  capital are really awful. So the KKK is pure social capital. Bonding social capital can
*  be very useful, but it can also be extremely dangerous. So far so good, except that bridging
*  social capital is harder to build than bonding social capital. But basically, that's the
*  challenge as I see it of America today. There's a lot more to say about it. But the basic
*  challenge is we need a lot more bridging social capital. And that's hard to do. And that's
*  especially true in politics.
*  Yeah, we'll get to politics. But I actually want to start by talking about individual
*  connections. You know, in preparation for this interview, I talked to a lot of people
*  about social isolation. My 33 year old niece feels it, my nearly 60 year old sister feels
*  it, I feel it. People think that they've lost the ability to connect. 24 years ago, you
*  placed a lot of blame on television. Nowadays, many people place the blame on phones. Although
*  maybe that's too simplistic.
*  Well, let me go back originally. At the time I wrote Bowling Alone, social media was still
*  six or seven years in the future. I did speculate a little bit about the about about social
*  media because I didn't guess that but about the internet. I did speculate a little bit.
*  And as it happens, my speculations about the effects of the internet turned out to be approximately
*  right. And it's now a quite common idea that social media are to blame for all of our troubles.
*  And I think that's a lot true. Although, even now, I don't think we should exculpate television.
*  There was a recent Nielsen report, which said that on average, the typical adult spends
*  more than 10 hours each day with media. Okay, 10 hours every day. Think of that. But about
*  half of that is still devoted to television. So even now, even long after the invention
*  of the internet and social media and the iPhone and so on, television still has that effect
*  of privatizing our leisure time. That's the fundamental thing it does.
*  Right. We're not interacting face to face with a real person.
*  Right. And one really important question that I don't think we really know is what is it
*  about face to faceless that matters so much? Face to face is matters. There's no doubt
*  about that. And why it matters. I don't know. Nobody knows. But I want to add one more thing
*  because to have that as a dichotomy, which most discussions of this have, is it better
*  to do Facebook or better to go bowling on a team? That kind of issue. That is not the
*  right way to think about the problem. What is?
*  I want to use an analogy here with the concept of alloy. And alloy is a mixture of two different
*  metals but mixing them together has unique characteristics. Today, almost all of our
*  social connections are simultaneously face to face and virtual. Our social ties are all
*  alloys. My wife and I, for example, we have offices just next door, but often we send
*  emails to each other. How weird is that?
*  I text my husband all the time even if we're in the same house.
*  Exactly. Well, it turns out that's not peculiar to your marriage or my marriage. That's extremely
*  common that our most intensive personal face to face ties are also the people with whom we
*  interact virtually most of the time. So there are ways in which we could combine face to
*  face and internet that would be really productive. We could develop social media in a way that
*  they would actually contribute to our lives, our personal lives and our collective lives.
*  But it would be a little less profitable.
*  Let me take this idea a little further because as we've been talking, there's been two sort
*  of ideas that are in tension here. One idea is that face to face is better. You've said
*  it, we definitely experienced it during the pandemic. We know it. We are social animals.
*  We need to see each other. And the other side is that you're texting your wife and I'm texting
*  my husband even though we're in the same house. We want community and yet there's something
*  that takes us away from community. Why?
*  There are two ways of answering that question. The first answer is we're busy. And you might
*  think therefore busy people are going to be more online and less face to face. But here's
*  what's complicated about that theory. Actually, when we look, and in bowling alone, I did this
*  very, very carefully. We look to see who is a joiner and who is not a joiner, who connects
*  in real life bowling leagues or Kiwanis or women's reading groups or whatever. And I
*  compared that to how busy they were. And the fact is busy people are more connected with
*  the rest of the world. So there are, I don't like to use pejorative language, but there
*  are some sloths among us who don't connect face to face and also don't connect with,
*  they just sit in front of the television. And there are other people who are very busy,
*  but nevertheless manage to connect with a lot of people, both face to face and during
*  the media. So it's basically, if you're asking why do we have people no longer connecting
*  face to face, it absolutely is not because we're too busy.
*  So then what is it?
*  Well, so I know you ask an academic a simple question and they answer with an encyclopedia.
*  And the next thing that academics always do is cite their most recent book. So that's
*  what I'm going to do. My most recent book is called The Upswing. I wrote it jointly
*  with a brilliant young woman named Shailen Romney Garrett. We looked at long run trends,
*  trends for example, in social capital, that is trends in connectedness, trends in loneliness,
*  that sort of thing over the last 125 years. And the short version is that curve, it's
*  an upside down U curve. We were socially isolated and distrustful in the early 1900s, but then
*  there was a turning point. And then we had a long upswing from roughly 1900 or 1910 till
*  roughly 1965. And that was the peak of our social capital. That is, that was people were
*  more trusting, then they were more connected, then they were more likely to be married,
*  then they were more likely to join clubs, then etc. And then for the next 50 years,
*  that trend turned around. And the book bowling alone looked at that single trend. But this
*  new book not only extends the length of time of looking at these things, but also looks
*  at three other variables. First, political polarization. That trend in political polarization
*  or depolarization follows the same pattern exactly that the trends in social connectedness
*  follow. That is low in the beginning of the 20th century, high in the 60s, and then plunging
*  to where we are now. So we now have a very politically polarized country, just as we
*  did 125 years ago. The next dimension is inequality. America was very unequal in what was called
*  the Gilded Age in the 1890s, 1900s. But then that turned around and the level of equality
*  in America went up until the middle 60s. In the middle 60s, it's hard to believe this,
*  in the middle 60s, America was more equal economically than socialist Sweden. And then
*  beginning in 1965, that turns around and plunges and now we're back down to where we were.
*  We're in a second Gilded Age. And the third variable that we look at is harder to discuss
*  and measure, but it's sort of cultural. To what extent do we think we're all in this
*  together or to what extent do we think it's every man for himself or every man and woman
*  And that has exactly the same trend. Pause. What caused that? I am trying to get to the
*  issues of causation because it turns out to be morality, according to my reading of this
*  evidence. What stands upstream of all these other trends is morality, a sense that we're
*  all in this together and that we have obligations to other people. Now, suddenly I'm no longer
*  the social scientist, I'm a preacher. I'm trying to say, we're not going to fix all
*  these problems in America, polarization, inequality, social isolation, until first of all, we start
*  feeling we have an obligation to care for other people. And that's not easy. So don't
*  ask me how to do that. That is a very hard thing to reverse, this idea that we're not
*  all in this together, this idea that we're not rowing the same way. And I'm hearing you
*  enumerate all these different things that are behind it, polarization, et cetera, et
*  cetera. What though makes this a uniquely American problem? Because we look at other
*  countries that have similar financial and economic and political systems and they don't
*  suffer as acutely at this moment as we do from these things.
*  Can I take issue with the framing of the question?
*  Please.
*  You say, why are we among all nations prone to or...
*  Uniquely afflicted.
*  Uniquely afflicted. And we're not. That's my short answer. Now I have to spell it.
*  But we are.
*  No, we're not. First of all, a little bit about the empirical data today. America is
*  polarized. So is France. So is Hungary. So is Canada. It's hard to name an advanced industrial
*  democracy in which there's not really deep, I mean seriously deep political polarization.
*  And if you'll allow me to get a little political, Trump-like figures in all of those countries.
*  Okay. How about economic inequality? The degree to which we're unequal, it's true, is pretty
*  probably higher in America than anywhere else. But the trend in inequality, that is the growth
*  of inequality over the last 35, 40 years, is completely non-unique to America.
*  Okay. How about social isolation? There was a lot of debate once upon a time when bowling
*  alone first came out. People said, well, true in America, but it's not true here. But then
*  there was a second wave and almost everybody agrees that there has been in their country
*  in the last 30 or 40 years, a growth in social isolation and loneliness. And indeed, some
*  places have the government department of loneliness. I'm not even joking. Okay. Now how about is
*  America uniquely individualistic? There was a guy who wandered around, a Frenchman actually,
*  who wandered around America in the 1830s, a guy named Alexis de Tocqueville.
*  Yes.
*  He wandered America in 1831 all over the country. And he came away thinking the most interesting
*  thing about America that he discovered was that it was incredibly communal. And he didn't
*  know the word social capital, too bad for him, but he was talking about joining. People
*  were always joining. However, he talked about, really incessantly about how Americans were
*  individualists. Now, how do you reconcile those two points? Is America individualistic
*  or are we communitarian? He, in effect, said there are ways in which Americans are both
*  and we even have a secret. He said this is the secret to America. It's called self-interest,
*  rightly understood. And he said it's because Americans, they do pursue their self-interest,
*  but they think about it in the long term. They think about, well, in the short run,
*  maybe I can gain by cheating somebody, but in the long run, that's bad for everybody.
*  If everybody followed that practice, we'd be a poorer country. We're all better off
*  if we all can cooperate.
*  It reminds me of something I've covered a lot of natural disasters, among other things.
*  And studies have shown that neighborhoods that have strong connections recover much
*  more quickly from natural disasters than neighborhoods that don't. The ones that have
*  strong ties, they do better.
*  Absolutely. And I'm conscious of that. At this moment, I'm speaking to you from Cambridge
*  Mass where we are lucky enough to have a very nice home right in Harvard Square, but we
*  also have a very nice home up in New Hampshire. And one of the reasons we like New Hampshire
*  is because it happened purely by chance that the places we're living has the highest level
*  of social capital in America. And I have got the data to show it. And what that means
*  is that if a disaster happens, the power goes out, which happens all the time up in the
*  woods, people will help one another.
*  Now maybe they would do that in Cambridge. I don't know. But in Cambridge, you probably
*  wait for the utility to fix the utility. But if there's a bad snowstorm, our neighbors
*  come to shovel us out because they think I'm too old to shovel the snow, which is actually
*  So I'm just reinforcing your idea that disasters require social capital.
*  Wait, wait. You own a house in the place with the most social capital in the United States.
*  Did that happen because you're there or you move there because it has social capital?
*  Well here's correlation and causation. I can show you the data that it had social capital
*  decades before I got there. No, no, it's the other way around. I think I was attracted
*  to Jaffrey is the name of this town. Well, partly because it's beautiful actually. But
*  I'm sure I was attracted to it without even at that point knowing it. Because you can
*  feel community. I mean, you can you can be there not very long and you can feel that
*  the neighbors are paying attention to you. One of the first times I went there, I mean,
*  sorry, this is just a silly story, but I went to the grocery store and they had different
*  kinds of potato salad. And I asked the guy at the counter, could I have some German potato
*  salad? And he gave it to me and it was super. And the next week I came back and I ordered
*  a different kind of potato salad because I thought, well, you know, maybe try something
*  different. He said, what, you didn't like the German potato salad I gave you last week?
*  I'm a total stranger and he's paying attention to my taste in potato salad.
*  So I'd imagine that people do come to you a lot asking for solutions about how to feel
*  less lonely on an individual level. And the thesis of this new documentary about your
*  life is join a club. But how does having fun in a running club, for example, translate
*  to democracy with a big D? How does that small germ of social connection in a club then translate
*  to I believe in this whole experiment that we are living in?
*  My work and this movie is designed to show you how it is that joining a club, even a
*  trivial, you know, pinnacle club or whatever, tiddlywinks, does help democracy. That's
*  what my work is designed to show. The reason that that's true is because it's only by connecting
*  with other people we generalize from our experience. I mean, in the running club, you learn that
*  you can trust other people and learn in a way how you need to do to maintain that trust.
*  The idea is that you're running with someone, you learn that you can care for people and
*  people can care for you, even people that are different, and therefore you're more likely
*  to then trust that government and institutions are actually working to help you too.
*  Yes, but I would say that the causal sequence is you begin with trusting other people.
*  And the trusting in other people produces a government that's trustworthy. The virtue
*  here is not trust, it's trustworthiness. I'm talking especially about government. That's
*  not like a silly difference. But trust without trustworthiness is just gullibility. I'm
*  not an advocate of pure blind trust. I'm an advocate of trustworthiness. I want other
*  people to be trustworthy of my trust and I want the government to be trustworthy.
*  Does it matter what kind of a club you join? Is there a tension between what might be more
*  enjoyable for you and what might be better in terms of saving American democracy?
*  Of course that's a tough question. I'm not sure I have any answer to it. It's got to
*  be fun. Building social capital is not like castor oil. You've got to take it because
*  it's good for you even though it feels awful. People don't join things unless they're fun.
*  So I am famous as the advocate of bowling clubs, but you don't bowl so you can build
*  a better community. You bowl because it's fun. And in the doing of the bowling, in a
*  team, I mean, you're hanging out with folks and you're talking about the latest TV show
*  that you saw or that occasionally you might talk about garbage pickup in town. And that's
*  democracy. I mean, doing democracy doesn't just mean, of course it means voting or it
*  means organizing. I'm a political scientist so I'm not opposed to that. I'm just saying
*  don't think that the way to save democracy is just to set out to save democracy.
*  So this is top of mind, of course, because we are in an election year. And this collective
*  experience that we're all having of feeling disconnected and alone and angry and upset
*  has bigger ramifications than just my own feeling of that.
*  Absolutely it does. Actually, I should say, even though I am a liberal Democrat, much
*  of my work has actually been supportive of and supported by people on the other side
*  of the aisle. I mean, I have a track record of not being partisan, but I am on the issue
*  of Trump because I think the MAGA movement is different. And why is it different? Well,
*  partly because it doesn't do bridging social capital. I mean, that's part of my diagnosis.
*  That's interesting. Let's talk about that. It doesn't do bridging social capital. It
*  does bonding social capital. It basically tries to find people that are like themselves
*  and exclude the other.
*  And not only exclude the other, but vilify the other and glorify the fact that it is
*  bonding social capital. I mean, that captures the essence of the Trump movement that they
*  hate bridging social capital and they love their bonding social capital. That is, they
*  glorify that they alone have the truth.
*  So what is the causality here? Are we politically polarized because we are less connected or
*  are we less connected because we are politically polarized?
*  Yes. By that, I mean, life is not all one way cause and effect. And it is a vicious
*  circle that we're caught in now. So what that means is any single strand, if you tried to
*  fix one single strand, you know, it wouldn't be enough because the other strands would
*  work against that. I don't have any simple solutions to that. I mean, sorry, did you
*  invite me here because you thought I was going to solve all of American problems? I don't
*  solve America. I don't solve problems.
*  I was told you were a sage. Okay, last question.
*  And then I have one for you.
*  Okay. I'm just thinking about, in the documentary, actually, you sitting at the table with three
*  presidents, President Clinton in the White House, and you must have felt at that moment
*  like your message was going to be received. You must have felt so hopeful at that point.
*  Sure. And in fact, I felt even more that way about Barack Obama. I mean, I was incredibly
*  hopeful about Barack Obama, not just because of who he was, but because I actually knew
*  him well until he became president. He called me Bob and I called him Barack. He drew on
*  my language in many of his speeches.
*  And yet, Dr. Putnam, I hear you and your passion is so great, and I'm moved by it, frankly.
*  But here we are.
*  Yeah. So, I don't know. You shouldn't think I've never asked myself that question. In
*  fact, one way to put it is this. Twenty-five years ago, I essentially predicted everything
*  that was going to happen. That's a little exaggerated, but not much. And yet, they happened.
*  Okay. I've been a little bit of an Isaiah, preaching how awful things are. One person
*  once said I was like an Old Testament prophet with charts. I've been working for, actually,
*  most of my adult life, and maybe even longer than that, to try to build a better, a more
*  productive, more equal, more connected community in America. And now I'm 83 and looking back,
*  it's been a total failure.
*  Now, should I be optimistic or pessimistic about the future? I don't know that I'm optimistic
*  or pessimistic. I could honestly, looking at the polls today, I could be pretty pessimistic.
*  But I am hopeful, because I can see how we could change it. And I'm doing my damnedest,
*  including right this moment, to try to change the course of history. I'm sorry, that's very
*  self-important, and I apologize for that, but I'm telling you honestly how I feel. I don't
*  mean to sound cynical, it's just that what can I do? I've tried my damnedest to sketch
*  a way forward, but I've not been persuasive enough.
*  Maybe it's just that one man can't do it alone. We need community.
*  You're right.
*  Well, what is your question?
*  If I'm right in examining your CV, you started your journalism career at the end of the 20th
*  century, roughly speaking 2000, just about the time that Bowling Alone was released.
*  Yes.
*  Suppose you didn't know me at all and didn't know the book, but you were trying to describe
*  how you think American society, or any of these societies you've studied, have changed.
*  I'm trying to turn you into not a social scientist, but neither am I a pure social scientist.
*  What's changed? Better? Worse?
*  Can I call you Bob?
*  Well, there are two options. Bob or your excellency. So yes, Bob.
*  I would say this. I came here in 2017 from having lived overseas, and the things that
*  I had seen in other places that I had not seen here before, I started to see here. Families
*  turning against each other, friendships broken, politics invading every part of people's lives.
*  And that has only accelerated. And I think, like you say, to turn that around is a hard
*  and Herculean task.
*  Actually, it's interesting that we have very different careers and origins and so on, but
*  I have actually seen an America that was better. So I know it doesn't have to be this way.
*  It doesn't mean I know how to get out of here, but America as a whole has been in good
*  times. We have trusted one another. That's what my books show. We've trusted one another.
*  We've loved one another. We've been equal to one another. We've voted for higher taxes
*  on ourselves in order to help poor Americans. We even began to reach across racial lines.
*  I mean, it's not an accident that the Civil Rights Movement comes at the peak of this upswing.
*  So I know that we can do better and I know that we've turned corners in the past.
*  I mean, we've come back from worse. So there's no question that you can turn a corner. But
*  you asked me in my lifetime what I'd seen. And I'm afraid the trajectory hasn't been
*  on an upswing. And I think that's what your data shows too.
*  Sure does.
*  It's not just the vibes.
*  I don't do vibes. I do data.
*  After the break, I called Bob back with a theory about why it's so hard to join a club
*  these days. Politics. But he's not so sure.
*  Everybody who studies people's views agree most people are not interested in politics.
*  Even now?
*  Even now!
*  Hello.
*  Hi, Lulu. How are you?
*  I'm good. How are you?
*  I'm terrific.
*  Are you at home?
*  I'm at home in New Hampshire. I'm looking down across our lawn to a pond and then on the far
*  side are trees. And beyond that is the tallest mountain between here and New York City. So
*  yeah, I'm in great shape. Thank you.
*  It sounds beautiful. I'm jealous.
*  So I was thinking about our conversation. And what struck me is, you know, to me, we
*  feel less connected because it just feels like politics has changed since you started
*  researching this. You know, our disagreements aren't just intellectual anymore about how
*  we should pay taxes or how we should fund programs. They feel fundamental and existential
*  to many people. And the remedies that are being proposed, like join a club, don't seem
*  practical because people don't want to spend time with folks who seem to threaten their
*  very way of life.
*  Lulu, there's a debate among academics about which comes first, the elite polarizing us
*  or the mass public polarizing. And there are two sides. I mean, there are debates about
*  of course, but there's a strong argument in my view that this is top down. The reason
*  people feel the way they do, that they don't want to hang out with people who differ from
*  them is because those are the message they're getting from their political leaders. And
*  there are people who want to join clubs and they're they really happy or happy in those
*  groups and they're not talking about politics. Most people in America don't care about politics.
*  That's sad for me to say as a political scientist, but that was the first discovery of empirical
*  political science. And so by now, everybody who studies people's views agree most people
*  are not interested in politics. Even now, even now, if you ask people, what are the
*  things that you were worried about in your, you know, your daily life? Politics is bottom
*  on the list. Most people don't, they don't wake up in the morning thinking, oh, I wish
*  I could stick it to those abortionists or whatever. They don't. Most people, they wake
*  up thinking about their marriage or their kids or the local sports team or whatever.
*  And then they turn on the news and the news is telling that they should, A, that they
*  should be concerned about public affairs, politics, and B, people telling them what
*  to think. The polarization that we're talking about is mainly provoked from above, to some
*  extent by media, but mostly by political leaders.
*  Okay, so let's say you got to sit with the next president, like you did with former
*  President Clinton and Obama. Yeah. What are the top policy solutions you'd recommend to
*  help remedy social isolation? I think there are a lot of specific things. For example,
*  about 125 years ago, in other words, roughly around 1900 or 1890, what was called the quote
*  boy problem was a big problem. I don't know what that is. Well, it was a problem of boys
*  who were getting in trouble and raising trouble for the country as a whole. And to address
*  that problem, a burst of new associations directed at boys were invented. Big Brothers
*  and the organization called Boys Clubs is now called Boys and Girls Club, but it was
*  invented in 1906 and Boy Scouts. Now, what do I infer from that? This goes back to my
*  understanding of why we would look at that period, the progressive era. Folks in that
*  era were concerned about the same problem we are now. That is, loner males, boys, especially,
*  were getting in trouble and causing the country trouble. And nowadays, it's exactly those
*  younger loner males who are drawn to white nationalism and violence. And so if I were
*  talking to the president and said, how do we solve this problem of white nationalism
*  and violence and terrorism in America? We have to begin early in life. And that means
*  thinking of new ways, not the Boy Scouts or whatever. But what did the Boy Scouts and
*  those other groups do that was so neat? They combined something that was fun with moral
*  indoctrination. A Scout is trustworthy, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient,
*  cheerful, I could do this once.
*  I love that you still remember most of it.
*  All the boys in my generation remember it because you had to. It was a pledge. A Scout
*  is trustworthy, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave,
*  clean and reverent. I got it. Now, some of that sounds a little, you know, thrifty sounds a
*  little dated, but trustworthy. And that's not wrong. So we need somebody as bright as the
*  people who invented those institutions. Now for the 21st century, to think about something
*  that's fun, that will actually be enjoyable for the kids, but also throw in a dose of
*  character education.
*  I want to end by asking you this. You've sounded frustrated with the lack of progress your
*  work has led to. Why do you think it's been so hard to get people from reading your book
*  and understanding your argument to actually doing something about it?
*  I wish I knew the answer to that question. Obviously, I wish I knew the answer to that
*  question. Obviously, I wish I knew the answer to that question. First of all, it's a tough
*  problem. I mean, if this were an easy problem, somebody else would have fixed it. And the
*  fact that we're divided as a country, or at least think we're divided, makes it even harder
*  to fix. But for the last 25 years, more than two thirds of my time has not been spent doing
*  research or writing books. I first of all ran something called the Saguaro seminar, which
*  tried really hard to get smart people, both practitioners and intellectuals together to
*  figure out these problems. And we still couldn't crack the problem. But that was my try and it
*  didn't work. And then the other thing I've spent a ton of time on, I've traveled, certainly
*  every state and, and to hundreds of towns, big towns and little towns all across America, I'm
*  probably over those 25 years, hundreds of 1000s of people I've personally spoken to, there are
*  some groups largely around community foundations across America that actually are now they would
*  tell you, they're following my agenda for trying to fix their communities, who have spent a lot
*  of their time over the last 20 years trying to do what I said they should do. Has that made a
*  difference? I don't, I don't know, I'd be hard pressed to make the case. But that's I, you know,
*  believe me, I'm more aware than you are of my failures.
