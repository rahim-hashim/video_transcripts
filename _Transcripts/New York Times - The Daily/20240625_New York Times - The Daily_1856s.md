# The Plan to Defeat Critics of Israel in Congress
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0roERsoYg1E)
*  From The New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  A powerful group supporting Israel is trying to defeat sitting members of Congress who
*  have criticized the country's deadly war against Hamas.
*  In today's Democratic primary in New York, it appears that strategy may work.
*  My colleague, Nick Fandos, explains.
*  It's Tuesday, June 25th.
*  Nick, by the time people listen to this episode, voting will have begun in this congressional
*  race, that Democrats across the country are watching really closely.
*  Because in a way, it feels like it's become a test of what a Democrat in office, in Congress,
*  can or can't say about the war in Gaza.
*  So let's start at the beginning with the congressman who is at the center of this race.
*  So we're talking here about Congressman Jamal Bowman.
*  He represents the district just north of New York City that includes parts of the Bronx
*  and cities like Yonkers and Mount Vernon, but also suburbs like Larchmont and Scarsdale.
*  He's a former middle school principal, lifelong educator who was never in politics until 2019
*  and 2020 when he decided, I'm going to take on a big, powerful incumbent in my district.
*  Why run for Congress?
*  Simple answer is I want to do everything in my power to meet the needs of my students
*  and families beyond the classroom.
*  And he did it from the left.
*  When you look throughout the district, you see pockets of the district where poverty
*  is higher than 20%.
*  You see pockets where the rent burdens are as high as 57%.
*  While in other parts of the district, you see incredible wealth and incredible affluence
*  and incredible opportunity.
*  So remember, this was right at the height of the COVID pandemic.
*  The election actually took place in the weeks after the killing of George Floyd.
*  And the whole country was up in arms, was really thinking about race and equity, was
*  thinking about power and whether the United States was moving quickly enough towards the
*  goals that it professes to have.
*  I want to put my run for Congress on the side for a moment and just speak to you as a black
*  man in America and as someone who's lived there his entire life.
*  And Bowman was really able to capture that energy as a younger black man who was not
*  in politics, speaks like a real person.
*  I never saw anyone that looked like me, that sounded like me, that came from the places
*  that I've come from, that spoke the language that mattered to me.
*  For Bowman, the race was about race and policing and Donald Trump and the feeling that the
*  Democratic Party was not fighting hard enough, fast enough on all of these issues.
*  I never saw anyone centering poverty and the working class and immigrants and those who
*  are most vulnerable in our country.
*  His slogan was jobs and education, not bombs and incarceration.
*  Thank you so much.
*  My name is Jamal Bowman.
*  I'm running for Congress in this district, the 16th district.
*  Please go out and vote and thank you for considering us as your next congressman.
*  Now his opponent, Elliot Engel, was in his 70s.
*  He'd been in Congress more than 30 years.
*  He's a committee chairman who was definitely more moderate than Bowman.
*  So in a sense this becomes a perfect distillation of the outsider versus the establishment insider
*  at a moment like you just said where that is the question of the moment.
*  Exactly and Bowman was really able to capitalize on a couple of instances where Engel looked
*  out of touch.
*  In one case he was caught having stayed in Washington for the early weeks and months
*  of the pandemic.
*  Far away from his district.
*  Yeah, far away from his district.
*  And then when he does show up, he's caught on a hot mic begging for a speaking slot at
*  an event.
*  And it's just too many folks here.
*  If I didn't have a primary I wouldn't care.
*  Say that again?
*  If I didn't have a primary I wouldn't care.
*  Because don't do that to me.
*  We're not going to do this.
*  Saying something to the effect of I wouldn't care except I've got a primary.
*  Right, I remember that moment.
*  It was incredibly embarrassing because here's a congressman already under fire for being
*  MIA from his district in the pandemic saying I need to talk at this news conference not
*  because I necessarily care but because I'm in a primary battle against Jamal Bowman and
*  I need voters to see me speaking and to think that I care.
*  Right, that's certainly what it looks like.
*  And Bowman on the other hand seems so in and of this moment that come election day he sails,
*  he beats Engel by double digits.
*  And it's received at the time as kind of proof of the left's ascendancy.
*  This is only a couple years after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her seat, the squad formed
*  in Washington, that far left group of lawmakers.
*  And when Bowman arrives in Washington he reinforces their ranks and adds to this kind of growing
*  progressive block that in the early days of the Biden administration seems to be exercising
*  a lot of power.
*  And one really emblematic moment where Bowman and the squad try and flex their muscle is
*  around President Biden's signature infrastructure bill.
*  Remember this is a big trillion dollar program to build roads and bridges and replace lead
*  pipes and originally there had been a democratic proposal to pair it with another bill more
*  focused on climate change and some social policy that progressives really liked.
*  And the two get split apart and the left is really upset about that.
*  So in order to try and get negotiating leverage to get that other climate bill passed, Bowman
*  and a bunch of the squad and other progressives vote against the infrastructure bill.
*  Vote against one of Biden's biggest legislative priorities and say it's not that we're against
*  it, but we need to have both.
*  So far, Nick, all of this very much feels in keeping with the way Bowman campaigned.
*  He's governing as the outsider progressive that he said he would be.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  He's pretty consistent and frankly is getting along all right in Washington.
*  I mean, some people don't like those positions, but generally speaking, he's in good standing
*  until two very consequential weeks last fall.
*  And what happens in those two weeks?
*  So let me just set the scene here.
*  It's late September.
*  Conservative Republicans are pulling Congress towards a government shutdown.
*  They're in on a Saturday.
*  Things are a total mess.
*  Nobody knows if the government's going to be able to pay its bills or find a solution.
*  And in the middle of all of this, Jamal Bowman is trying to rush to the Capitol to get to
*  a vote.
*  He gets to a door that he usually expects to go out.
*  It's locked.
*  He tries it.
*  And then what does he do?
*  He pulls a fire alarm.
*  New York Congressman Jamal Bowman, the former school principal, caught red handed pulling
*  the fire alarm inside a house office building.
*  It sends the Capitol basically into chaos, becomes a two day news cycle.
*  As a principal in my schools, we did fire drills.
*  You know exactly what happens when you pull a fire alarm.
*  All these national cameras are already paying attention.
*  And now here's this crazy sideshow.
*  He violated the exact same law that January 6th defendants are being prosecuted for every
*  single day, interrupting an official proceeding.
*  He said after the fact that he was trying to open the door, but generally you don't
*  pull a fire alarm to open a door.
*  His explanation that he did this by accident, also false.
*  That's the reason that I've asked the House Ethics Committee to review this.
*  And eventually Bowman is actually charged and pleads guilty to a misdemeanor for a false
*  fire alarm.
*  Listen, you know, I pulled the fire alarm.
*  I did not do it to disrupt the court proceeding.
*  Like I said, I was trying to get out the door.
*  I was rushing to a vote.
*  I'm thankful that, you know, we have an agreement in place.
*  I'm thankful in three months it's going to be dismissed.
*  And now let's move on.
*  He has to pay a fine and apologize.
*  And so it's just a real kind of black eye on his public image.
*  Right.
*  Embarrassing, ill-advised, but at the end of the day, not anything that's going to
*  necessarily endanger his career.
*  Yeah, no, that's right.
*  I think if it had just been that alone, he gets past it.
*  But almost exactly a week later is October 7th.
*  When Hamas attacks Israel brutally, takes hostages, leaves 1200 Israelis dead, and really
*  ushers in a new moment in American politics, and particularly for Democrats who have been
*  divided on Israel for quite a while, particularly this kind of the left-wing squad from the
*  rest of the party.
*  And those divisions are just kind of blown up in the days and weeks after October 7th.
*  And Bowman, of all people, throws himself right into the middle of the wreckage.
*  We acknowledge the trauma and the pain and the fear.
*  He condemns Hamas's attack on October 7th, but then just days later calls for a ceasefire
*  in the region, essentially saying Israel should not defend itself.
*  And that's a position I should note, by the way, that is way out ahead of President Biden,
*  who hadn't even gone yet at that point to Israel to give Benjamin Netanyahu that famous
*  hug and say that the United States was sanding with Israel.
*  You're calling for some weird ceasefire that isn't going to accomplish anything other than
*  Hamas.
*  Give Hamas, which is basically an ISIS organization, time to regroup and kill more Jews.
*  Never say ever that I'm OK with the killing of Jews.
*  Ever say that.
*  Ever.
*  Because no one...
*  This is insane.
*  Now, from Bowman's point of view, this is consistent with the way that he views international politics.
*  Remember, the no bombs part of his slogan.
*  Right.
*  He wants Israel here to not meet violence with violence, to find some sort of diplomatic
*  or political solution.
*  Let me just be very clear.
*  It's one thing to support Israel, which the US has always done and will continue to do.
*  It's another thing to never hold Israel accountable for their behavior, whether it's related to
*  the occupation, the open air prison at his Gaza, or the war crimes that are taking place
*  right now during this siege.
*  Bowman sees this as a clear moral case.
*  I think he relates what's happening in Israel to the racial justice struggle in the United
*  States that he's familiar with, to the economic struggle.
*  Israel to him is a powerful nation that is not making good on its own promises as a democracy
*  and is oppressing Palestinians.
*  The Muslim community, the Arab community and Palestinians receive that as erasure and even
*  further receive it as dehumanization.
*  So it sounds like in this moment, Bowman is becoming the public face of left wing congressional
*  Democrats, wariness and skepticism of Israel at an exceptionally sensitive moment.
*  Yes.
*  And in the weeks that would follow, he goes there again and again and again.
*  So he's one of the first lawmakers not only to call for a ceasefire, but then to accuse
*  Israel of committing genocide in Gaza once its counteroffensive begins.
*  He begins calling for the United States to cut off all military aid to Israel, which
*  is one of its closest allies in the middle of this war, saying basically American taxpayers
*  shouldn't be going to bombs.
*  At one point he's caught on video saying that claims that Hamas use sexual violence against
*  women around October 7th is quote propaganda.
*  Later he apologized for those remarks and all of this really adds to Bowman's prestige
*  on the left.
*  He becomes a big figure, a galvanizing figure really in this energized anti-war movement
*  around Gaza.
*  But at the same time, he's taking a huge political risk.
*  His district, which remember is just north of New York City, is quite diverse.
*  It's got a big black and Latino population, but it also is home to one of the largest
*  Jewish populations in the country.
*  And many of his constituents in that community feel betrayed.
*  And not only that, back in Washington, pro-Israel groups who exercise a huge amount of power
*  are furious at Bowman.
*  They look at everything that's happening and they think, he's got an election coming.
*  We might be able to defeat him and in so doing make an example out of him.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Nick, tell us about this well-funded effort by supporters of Israel to try to make an
*  example of Congressman Bowman.
*  To answer that, Michael, let's take a little bit of a step back in time and talk about
*  AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which is a bipartisan group that's
*  been around for a long time whose mission really is to advance Israel's interests in
*  the United States.
*  Traditionally, they've had very strong relationships with presidents and legislative leaders in
*  both parties.
*  They've been really effective, frankly, at creating a consensus in Congress and in Washington
*  more broadly to send military aid and defense to help protect Israel in the Middle East
*  from its neighbors.
*  They pay for lawmakers to travel to Israel and see the country.
*  And they've long endorsed candidates they see as friends of Israel and even made small
*  donations.
*  And then more recently, they began to take much bigger overt political steps.
*  A couple of years ago, they formed a super PAC for the first time.
*  And they're doing it because they're watching that consensus that they work so hard to build
*  start to crumble.
*  And particularly on the left among young voters and particularly young Democratic voters and
*  Democratic voters of color who no longer see Israel in the way that maybe their parents
*  or grandparents' generation did.
*  And for APEC, the embodiment of that change is the Squad.
*  Then October 7th happens and intensifies all of these dynamics.
*  And APEC senses a real existential threat.
*  And so they go and they survey the electoral landscape.
*  They look at all the members of the Squad and other progressives in Congress who are
*  critical of Israel and are trying to change the American relationship to it.
*  And they figure out, okay, where could we go in electorally and could we knock some
*  of these people out?
*  And how do they end up zeroing in on Bowman, of all people?
*  So beating incumbents is not the easiest thing to do.
*  So in many cases, they look at some of their biggest critics, people like Rashida Tlaib
*  or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and they simply can't find a viable challenger.
*  These guys are smart.
*  They've run political campaigns before.
*  They don't want to put good money after bad and waste it.
*  But Bowman, they look at him and think, this guy is beatable.
*  Not only do they not like what he's saying about Israel, but in this case, they are able
*  to find a primary challenger who is not only credible, but is deeply popular in the district.
*  And who is that?
*  I'm George Latimer.
*  The opponent is George Latimer.
*  I've served in my local city hall.
*  I've served in the county and the state legislature and now as Westchester County Executive to
*  focus on getting results, not just rhetoric.
*  A well-known Democratic fixture who first entered politics in the Reagan era and now
*  serves as the county executive of Westchester County, which is the biggest county in the district.
*  We've seen Israel created 75 years ago as a valid country.
*  It has a right to exist and it has a right to exist on defensible borders.
*  And he's also importantly staunchly pro-Israel.
*  I think the Israeli people need to see that they have a partner for peace and they don't
*  see a partner for peace right now.
*  A Democrat, frankly, in the mold of that old consensus model, who is willing to stand
*  by United States ally Israel through thick and thin.
*  I have taken the position for a legislator to take a future legislator is to work through
*  your legislative bodies and try to influence the president in that fashion.
*  So in the fall, he starts getting outreach from local rabbis and Jewish leaders in the
*  district to jump in.
*  And AIPAC gives him some encouragement as well.
*  So in a sense, AIPAC is helping to recruit Latimer to run against Bowman.
*  Right.
*  And not only do they help to recruit him, but once he does get in the race and establishes,
*  I'm a supporter of Israel, they begin raising very large amounts of money directly for his
*  campaign and in time their super PAC starts spending far, far more to advance his candidacy.
*  And what does it look like for AIPAC's super PAC to advance Latimer's candidacy in this
*  primary?
*  So since mid May, AIPAC's super PAC has spent upwards of $14.5 million in this race.
*  That's a lot of money.
*  That's just over a month.
*  Yeah, it's a huge amount of money, something like almost $17,000 an hour at one point.
*  And if you add it all up, it's actually not only more than AIPAC has ever spent in a single
*  race, it's more than any outside group, any super PAC has ever spent in a house race.
*  George Latimer is putting people ahead of personal agendas and delivering real progressive
*  results.
*  So some of that money actually goes towards a positive act, trying to improve Latimer's
*  image as a good progressive who stands by President Biden.
*  George Latimer will take on MAGA extremists and he'll work with President Biden to keep
*  delivering progressive results.
*  But most of it is reserved for attacks on Bowman.
*  Here's the deal.
*  I used to be for Jamal Bowman, but not anymore.
*  Bowman put his extreme ideology ahead of us.
*  One of only six Democrats to oppose the historic infrastructure bill.
*  So they bring back that infrastructure vote.
*  And the idea is basically to try and paint Bowman as a disloyal Democrat, somebody who's
*  attacking the president and is a chaos agent in Washington.
*  Bowman called President Biden a liar.
*  Jamal Bowman has his own agenda and he's hurting New York.
*  And notably, notice I have not mentioned Israel because none of these ads, at least none of
*  the ones on TV, mention Israel.
*  Why would that be?
*  Why would AIPAC, which is clearly in the business of protecting Israel, run a bunch of TV ads
*  against Jamal Bowman, who they object to because of his views on Israel, and not mention those
*  views about Israel in the ads?
*  Yeah, it's a great question and it's one that's inspired Bowman and his supporters to be like,
*  what gives?
*  So from AIPAC's point of view, the logic is that voters in the district who really care
*  about Israel, no matter which side they're on, have probably already made up their mind
*  about Jamal Bowman.
*  They're not going to be persuaded.
*  But there's a big bunch of primary voters who may not be following the war that closely,
*  but they are loyal Democrats.
*  They like President Biden.
*  They're interested in beating Trump this fall.
*  And they are susceptible to seeing ads about a guy who seems to be bucking the president,
*  who's out of the mainstream and not representing them.
*  Interesting.
*  So an effective strategy from a group supporting Israel is not necessarily to talk about Israel
*  in this campaign, but to talk about the way that a Democrat, Jamal Bowman in this case,
*  is letting down his party's president, is letting down his party, is basically being
*  disloyal to the Democratic Party, not necessarily Israel.
*  Yes, and so far from what we can tell, it seems to be pretty effective.
*  Explain that.
*  So when I'm out in the district talking to voters, a really interesting thing has started
*  happening.
*  Many of them, when I ask them their views on Latimer and Bowman, start quoting back
*  to me or citing facts that are very prominently being featured in these commercials.
*  Now often they think it's their own idea, but in political advertising, this is a sign
*  of real success.
*  Voters are thinking about infrastructure.
*  They're thinking about loyalty.
*  They're thinking about Bowman as a chaos agent.
*  And I don't think it's an accident that they're thinking about those things.
*  It's not an accident because they're getting those views you're suggesting from these now
*  ubiquitous ads.
*  Exactly.
*  So ubiquitous that some households are getting dozens of mailers a week reinforcing these
*  points and some of these AIPAC ads have been viewed upwards of 180 million times.
*  Wow.
*  180 million.
*  I mean, it's astonishing.
*  It's complete saturation.
*  What you're describing here is anecdotal reporting that you've done in the district.
*  What are the polls telling us about the state of this race between Bowman and Latimer?
*  There has not been as much credible polling in this race as we would like, but what we
*  have seen in polls that have come out is that Latimer has opened up a very large lead, double
*  digits.
*  And while it's hard to exactly attribute cause and effect here, I think everyone would agree
*  that if you spend $15 million, it's going to have an impact on the way voters think
*  and eventually pull on the ballot.
*  AKA, these ads do seem to be very much hurting to Maubach.
*  They're certainly not helping.
*  Okay.
*  What does Bowman have to say about the fact that he has become the target of a group like
*  AIPAC in this race?
*  Bowman's response has been really interesting because where other politicians, I think,
*  faced with this set of circumstances who want to get reelected might kind of pull back or
*  moderate some of their harshest positions, Bowman has totally stood firm where he is
*  and he's actually leaned into the AIPAC ads and made AIPAC a central point of his campaign,
*  arguing that they are the representation of everything that's wrong with big money in
*  American politics, that they're coming in and have basically not only bought his opponent,
*  but are now trying to buy an election.
*  And oh, by the way, they may be a bipartisan group, but they're doing with big checks from
*  Republican mega donors.
*  And they're coming after me, not just because of my position on Israel, but because those
*  donors don't like the other things I stand for, the progressive values, my outspokenness
*  as a black man.
*  He's really made this a kind of referendum in his words of the money versus the many.
*  And by what he means by that is all this money versus the people who don't have that much
*  money but are fighting against entrenched corporate interests.
*  He's basically taking it back to his original 2020 Democratic primary when he was running
*  on a message of me versus the establishment.
*  Exactly.
*  And he says, the establishment never liked me.
*  And this strategy has really worked to kind of galvanize the national progressive movement.
*  They've really rallied around him.
*  They've donated money.
*  Groups like Justice Democrats have emptied their bank accounts to try and save him.
*  What's up?
*  What's up?
*  What's up?
*  And all of this came together this past weekend at a rally in the Bronx.
*  What's up, New York?
*  Where Representative Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders joined Bowman and a bunch of other
*  progressives, some of whom flew in from as far away as Florida.
*  And Bowman was really fired up.
*  And because they see the power of our movement, they are spending more money than has ever
*  been spent in American history, y'all.
*  He framed it as if their whole movement was on the line.
*  AIPAC is scared to death.
*  We are not going to stand silent while U.S. tax dollars kills babies and women and children.
*  And profanely, again and again, ripped into AIPAC and what they're doing in this race.
*  People ask me why I got a foul mouth.
*  What am I supposed to do?
*  You coming after me?
*  I just want to say, Michael, because I was there, Bowman very well may keep this seat.
*  But the man on that stage was certainly acting like he was up against the wall and had nothing
*  to lose.
*  He was letting it all rip.
*  Nothing that AIPAC can do is going to stop our liberation.
*  Nothing.
*  They have already lost.
*  Nick, if Bowman does lose, and we have to be really clear on the if-ness of that question,
*  it's a summer primary.
*  Turnout's going to be, who knows?
*  We're in the middle of a heat wave here.
*  The polling's been kind of subpar.
*  But if Bowman loses, I have to imagine AIPAC will claim this as a big victory for its cause,
*  will say we have made an example of this member of Congress.
*  But taking out a lawmaker, I have to think, is very different than rebuilding a consensus
*  around support for Israel, which is AIPAC's real goal, isn't it?
*  Absolutely.
*  This is such an important point, Michael, because as we've said, AIPAC's real goal here
*  is to maintain or reinstate a consensus support for Israel and the United States.
*  And that has to do with both who's in Congress and who the people electing them are.
*  And you can take people out of Congress, and they may succeed in taking out Bowman.
*  They may succeed later this summer in another primary in Missouri in taking out Representative
*  Cory Bush.
*  Another member of the squad.
*  Exactly.
*  But if they're not changing the minds of the people who elect them, if they're not actually
*  running ads that are trying to change those people's minds, or running candidates that
*  are trying to change those people's minds, who's to say that in the future, when circumstances
*  are different or candidates don't have the flaws that Bowman maybe did, that those voters
*  aren't just going to keep electing more politicians that AIPAC doesn't like.
*  And it seems to me that in this race, not only have they missed an opportunity to try
*  and move voters in the direction they want, they may actually be spawning a bigger backlash
*  that could cause them further problems down the line.
*  The very people that they're trying to win back, I think have only seen their distrust
*  for AIPAC grow.
*  Right, and perhaps by proxy Israel itself.
*  Exactly.
*  And in the long term, that seems to make the problem worse, not better.
*  But at the same time, for AIPAC, a win's a win.
*  And they seem to be saying that they are willing to let that longer term battle over democratic
*  hearts and minds play out another day.
*  Because right now they have a much more urgent question and problem in front of them, and
*  that is the war that's going on with Hamas and the need for American military aid.
*  And so the composition of this Congress matters a lot to Israel right now, and it matters
*  a lot to AIPAC.
*  And a defeat of somebody like Jamal Bowman not only takes out one of their critics, but
*  it sends a message to everybody else in Congress who may be considering voting to cut off aid
*  or criticizing Israel in other ways, that you're either with us or we're coming after
*  you next.
*  And that chilling effect for AIPAC may be the most important victory of all.
*  Well, Nick, thank you very much.
*  Always a pleasure, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, has agreed to plead guilty to a single felony
*  count of illegally obtaining and disclosing U.S. national security material in exchange
*  for his release from a British prison where he spent more than five years.
*  The deal would end Assange's long standoff with the U.S., which began after he released
*  highly sensitive American secrets, including documents about military activity in Iraq
*  and Afghanistan and confidential cables shared among diplomats.
*  After the deal, Assange will serve no additional prison time.
*  And for the first time, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide the constitutionality
*  of state laws banning medical treatments for transgender youth.
*  The court will examine a Tennessee law that prohibits three types of transgender medical
*  care for minors, puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and gender transition surgeries.
*  Its ruling, expected next year, could have broad ramifications for the roughly two dozen
*  states that have enacted similar bans.
