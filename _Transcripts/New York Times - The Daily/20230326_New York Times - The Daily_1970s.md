# The Sunday Read: ‘How Danhausen Became Professional Wrestling’s Strangest Star’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niAa4PG3Yco)
*  Hi, I'm Dan Brooks and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  I live in Montana with my handsome dog.
*  If you've ever seen professional wrestling, you're probably familiar with a concept called
*  K-Fabe.
*  You could say that K-Fabe is the fake part of pro wrestling.
*  The characters, the storylines, the match outcomes.
*  It's the world inside of wrestling, which, although planned and scripted, is presented
*  as real to fans.
*  But fans absolutely understand that it is fake.
*  One wrestler named Donovan Danhausen has an unusual gimmick in this world.
*  His entire persona is this sort of comedic meta-commentary on K-Fabe and on pro wrestling
*  itself.
*  It's a complicated stunt that, it turns out, hardcore wrestling fans love.
*  For this week's Sunday read, you'll hear the profile I wrote about Danhausen and his
*  rise as this face-painted, curse-wielding wrestling weirdo.
*  I think what really distinguishes Danhausen from his peers is that he doesn't take himself
*  too seriously.
*  He has this white face of makeup with big black circles around the eyes, black lipstick,
*  sort of evoking the band Kiss or the silent horror film Nosferatu.
*  He enters the ring in a big cape and tights like a lot of wrestlers.
*  But at 5'10 and roughly 175 pounds, he is not physically imposing.
*  He speaks in a vaguely European accent, kind of partaking in the tradition of cartoon villains
*  that way.
*  Many wrestlers have signature moves, their own way of finishing off an opponent or bringing
*  the match to a climax.
*  Danhausen's move doesn't involve touching the other wrestler at all.
*  He raises his hands, points his fingers, and curses them, which is a purely meta wrestling
*  attack, like he's casting a spell.
*  And the crowd goes wild.
*  But I think what makes Danhausen's act legitimate and so satisfying to watch is that he's actually
*  a skilled technical athlete.
*  He's also just a fundamentally likeable character, which is reflected in his catchphrase, very
*  nice, very evil.
*  So to understand Danhausen, you need to understand the world of indie pro wrestling.
*  Before the 1980s, American pro wrestling was organized around regional promotions that
*  had local TV deals.
*  Each territory had its own wrestlers, its own show, and its own storylines.
*  That all changed in the 1980s, when Vince McMahon purchased what is now known as WWE,
*  or World Wrestling Entertainment.
*  He started buying up talent from regional promotions and consolidating the wrestling
*  audience into a single national market.
*  That's when we saw breakout stars like Hulk Hogan, who crossed over from pro wrestling
*  to mainstream entertainment.
*  But that period also destroyed the regional promotions.
*  And in their absence, a sort of ecosystem of independent wrestling shows has taken hold.
*  These shows happen in bars, American Legion halls, sometimes in backyards.
*  They're rarely televised, but they do get bootlegged on the internet.
*  And fans who go to these shows are extremely dedicated to pro wrestling.
*  Fans like Danhausen will travel the circuit of these shows the same way comedians travel
*  nightclubs.
*  And it's through this circuit that Danhausen was signed to All Elite Wrestling, or AEW,
*  in 2021.
*  It's the second biggest wrestling promotion in America.
*  When I met Danhausen last year, he was going into this big event for AEW in Las Vegas.
*  He had a lot of internet momentum behind him, but he had relatively little television exposure.
*  He'd also just recovered from an injury.
*  So he was about to wrestle for the first time in six months in front of the largest audience
*  of his career, about 14,000 people.
*  Something that struck me then about Danhausen was how he planned out almost nothing in advance.
*  Pro wrestling's outcomes are scripted, and yet it always seemed that Danhausen went into
*  the ring with a vague sense of how things were actually going to go, which meant it
*  could all get very messy.
*  So here's my article, How Danhausen Became Professional Wrestling's Strangest Star,
*  read by James Patrick Cronin.
*  Like a lot of people who get into professional wrestling, Donovan Danhausen had a vision of
*  a different version of himself.
*  Ten years ago, at age 21, he was living in Detroit, working as a nursing assistant at
*  a nearby hospital, watching a lot of adult swim and accumulating a collection of horror
*  and comedy-themed tattoos.
*  He didn't know what he wanted to do with his life, but he knew that he liked to make short
*  videos with his friends, the kind of outsider art that happens in basements and backyards
*  across America.
*  At the suggestion of one of those friends, he took a 12-week training course at the House
*  of Truth Wrestling School in Centerline, Michigan, and then entered the Indy Circuit as a hand,
*  an unknown, unpaid wrestler who shows up at events and does what's asked of him, typically
*  setting up the ring, pretending to be a lawyer or other species of extra, maybe participating
*  in a battle royale.
*  For the next few years, he worked shows around the Great Lakes region, wrestling strangers
*  or sometimes the guy he rode up with, trying to figure out where he fit in.
*  Dan Howson climbed the ladder from hand to known amateur, then local headliner and traveling
*  feature talent, but he remained firmly within the world of day jobs and inconsistently reimbursed
*  expenses.
*  By 2017, he had moved to Florida and was plying the local Indy Circuit as Kid Gorgeous, surviving
*  on a job at Starbucks and what little he earned wrestling at shows within driving distance
*  of Miami.
*  It was not working.
*  Most weeks, he would clock in to Starbucks at 5am, clock out at 1, and then travel to
*  an event.
*  One night, after what was supposed to be a chest kick caught him in the throat, a painful
*  injury that briefly made him worry he might lose his ability to speak, he sat in his car
*  and thought, I am not having fun.
*  He was driving a lot, getting hurt and not getting paid.
*  The struggle to sell himself to audiences as a physical specimen felt like skating uphill.
*  I was just a bearded guy with the tattoos trying to be a tough guy, and I'm not a tough
*  guy, naturally, he told me.
*  But I can be weird and charismatic, goofy, that's easy.
*  That's also a role that most people don't want to fill.
*  Five years into his wrestling career, Dan Howson did what any serious artist does when
*  he runs out of momentum.
*  He looked for a new gimmick.
*  He had fond memories of Halloween's when his father made him up as a zombie, so he
*  put on black and white face paint.
*  At first, the idea was serious.
*  The character, also named Dan Howson, was supposed to be an evil demon.
*  But Dan Howson the man found that the more elements of humor he incorporated into his
*  performance, the more audiences responded.
*  He stopped growling with the agony of the damned and started ordering the crowd to clap
*  and cheer for him.
*  He made his physical movements less creepy and more awkward.
*  These changes made the character more fun to play and brought it in line with his life
*  outside wrestling, which did not include a background in competitive sports, much less
*  fighting.
*  The sole entry on his combat sports resume was one karate class he attended at age six,
*  which he left when he learned they would have to be barefoot.
*  Other than that, I have no background in anything.
*  I don't have a wrestling background.
*  I'm not into sports.
*  I don't have an improv background.
*  I watched wrestling and I watched The Simpsons.
*  Over the next couple of years, the Dan Howson gimmick became more funny than evil, eventually
*  settling on the character he plays today, one that is bizarre even by the standards
*  of 21st century wrestling.
*  Dan Howson is a ghoul, maybe, or some kind of gremlin.
*  He wears makeup that looks as if he's in a silent film about Kiss, and he speaks in
*  a kind of generally European accent.
*  He may or may not have magic powers.
*  He refers to himself in the third person and punctuates many of his on-camera appearances
*  by asking his co-stars for money, which he refers to as human money.
*  His physical presence is somewhere between frail and confused.
*  He tends to hold his hands at chest level, one on top of the other, like Zorak from Space
*  Ghost, and his reactions are characterized by rapid head movements, as though he were
*  continually startled by stage lights, objects being handed to him, etc.
*  He also has what may be the first signature move in wrestling history that does not involve
*  touching his opponents at all.
*  He curses them, a metaphysical attack he executes by pointing both forefingers, one at arm's
*  length and the other near his chin, while bugging out his eyes.
*  The crowd goes wild, but otherwise nothing really happens after he does it.
*  At least, not at first.
*  But a cursed opponent might subsequently swing a folding chair in such a way that it rebounds
*  off the turnbuckle and hits him in the face, or he might slip and fall as he climbs out
*  of the ring, or he may just get distracted at the critical moment and fail to see another
*  wrestler charging in from behind.
*  Dan Howzen's dubious command of occult forces is only one aspect of his absurd presentation,
*  which blurs the line between what is supposed to be real in the fictive world of pro-wrestling
*  and what is supposed to be his character's own delusion.
*  He is not 6'7", probably, as his self-reported measurements claim, nor does he weigh in at
*  over 300 pounds.
*  At 5'10", and roughly 175 pounds, the real Dan Howzen is physically unimposing.
*  It was this final element, active denial of his own limitations as a wrestler, that turned
*  his whole gimmick into a kind of commentary on wrestling itself.
*  And he has found that this commentary resonates deeply with the class of obsessive fans who
*  attend indie shows and watch videos of indie wrestling on the internet.
*  "'Wrestling is a parody of sports.
*  It always was,' R.J.
*  Citty, a fellow AEW wrestler and a longtime friend of Dan Howzen's, told me.
*  But this is now a parody of that parody."
*  Late in 2021, Dan Howzen was approached by Tony Khan, the co-owner and chief executive
*  of All Elite Wrestling, an upstart promotion carried by TBS and TNT that is disrupting
*  a long period of industry stasis.
*  Over the last two decades, the story of the wrestling business has been world wrestling
*  entertainment, commonly known as WWE, exercising unchallenged dominance over the industry.
*  In September 2021, however, AEW's Dynamite drew a larger share of 18-49 year olds than
*  WWE's Raw for two consecutive weeks.
*  This seemingly modest news, a temporary blip in the ratings, constituted a seismic event
*  among hardcore wrestling fans, many of whom regard the WWE in roughly the way fans of
*  indie rock regard major record labels.
*  While WWE remains the larger promotion in both audience size and estimated value, there
*  is now a number two.
*  AEW tends to attract longtime enthusiasts, connoisseurs, what the culture sometimes refers
*  to as Marx.
*  These are the people who shout, woo, the signature vocalization of Ric Flair when someone does
*  a backhand chop, a signature move of Ric Flair.
*  Marx loved Dan Howzen.
*  To them, he represents a different kind of star for a new era of pro wrestling, one who
*  appeals to obsessive consumers who feel underserved by what they perceive as the WWE's focus
*  on capturing the largest audience possible.
*  Now that he is a fan favorite, Dan Howzen's ostensible power to manipulate the outcomes
*  of his matches has become the power to manipulate the industry itself.
*  The curses aren't real, but the popularity that incentivizes AEW to make him a winner
*  is.
*  Dan Howzen occupies a point of singularity in the manifold of artifice and truth that
*  is the pro wrestling universe.
*  The place where the story and the show and the business intersect.
*  It is true that pro wrestling is fake.
*  While we're at it, so are movies, television, and a substantial portion of the internet.
*  The show, however, is real.
*  The experience of watching the fake wrestling match, in which performer athletes playing
*  exaggerated or downright invented versions of themselves engage in an improvised stage
*  combat whose winner has been determined in advance, and feeling either entertained or
*  bored is real.
*  The fun of being a wrestling fan, especially at a live event, is that you get to boo the
*  heels and cheer the faces, as the good guys are known, in accordance with your understanding
*  of the fake world of the show.
*  But you also get to express your own enjoyment of or dissatisfaction with that show in a
*  way that is totally, viscerally real.
*  The business is also real.
*  For many hardcore fans, it constitutes a kind of show beyond the show that is sometimes
*  more interesting than any given match, the way draft picks and salary caps are occasionally
*  of primary interest to fans of the NBA.
*  The workings of the wrestling business are sometimes incorporated into the world of the
*  show, as in the case of Vincent K. McMahon, the former chairman and chief executive of
*  WWE, who for years played a heightened version of himself that antagonized wrestlers and
*  audiences alike.
*  This fictional character reflected actual resentments.
*  Before the 1980s, televised professional wrestling was a patchwork of deals between local broadcasters
*  and regional promotions, which operated in a kind of feudal system of defined, albeit
*  periodically contested territories.
*  In 1983, McMahon's World Wrestling Federation embarked on a period of aggressive expansion,
*  snapping up talent and driving rival promotions out of business until the previously fractured
*  wrestling audience became a single nationwide market that WWF could dominate through star
*  power and superior capital outlay.
*  The last meaningful challenge to this dominance came in 1995, when Ted Turner's World Championship
*  wrestling introduced Monday Nitro on TNT, directly opposite WWF's Monday Night Raw.
*  After a ratings contest that lasted a little over a year, WCW's audience share began to
*  falter and WWF, which had changed its name to World Wrestling Federation Entertainment
*  before shortening it to World Wrestling Entertainment, purchased WCW's intellectual property and
*  the contracts of its most popular wrestlers in 2001.
*  In the two decades since, WWE has enjoyed something like a monopoly on televised professional
*  wrestling, which allowed stars like The Rock and John Cena to cross over to a mainstream
*  audience and now threatens to relieve the company of the need to please its most hardcore
*  fans.
*  In August 2021, WWE's president, Nick Khan, who is not related to Tony, caused a stir
*  when he said that WWE was interested in looking beyond the normal indie wrestling channels
*  to find new talent.
*  In the wake of WWE's consolidation of the televised wrestling business, the disappearance
*  of territorial promotions created the conditions for a new ecosystem of untelevised independent
*  wrestling shows to take hold, the way certain species of flora resurge after a forest fire.
*  These promotions, which present shows in bars, backyards and other venues that can be rented
*  for relatively little money up front, rely on a churning roster of amateur and semi-professional
*  wrestlers who work their local circuits the way aspiring comics work showcases and open
*  mics.
*  While almost none of these promotions have a TV deal, there exists an avid community
*  of indie wrestling fans online.
*  A bootleg video of a sufficiently interesting bar show can reach a significant audience,
*  creating an indie to professional pipeline that is just plausible enough to entice young
*  aspirants.
*  Tony Khan has built AEW's roster around a combination of fan favorites from the indie
*  circuit and older veterans of televised wrestling.
*  A kind of mark himself, he claims to have kept notebooks, since age 12, that detailed
*  characters and storylines for shows that would eventually become dynamite and rampage, AEW's
*  Wednesday and Friday night programs.
*  Tony Khan is 40, wears his hair bushy and speaks in a fluent monotone, with the confidence
*  and peculiar affect that signal generational wealth.
*  His father, Shad Khan, is an auto parts billionaire and co-owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars and
*  Fulham Football Club.
*  There seems to be no aspect of AEW's operation in which Tony Khan is not involved.
*  Our formal interview backstage during Memorial Day weekend's rampage event took place while
*  with the production truck, the in-ring referee, the announcing team and the veteran wrestler
*  Dustin Rhodes, who assists with the live show in various ways, including by identifying
*  each in-ring move for the broadcast announcers.
*  Khan's role in this process is to ensure that the largely improvised show progresses according
*  to the schedule determined by the television deal.
*  During our conversation, he repeatedly interrupted himself to give timing instructions to the
*  referee, who then surreptitiously communicated them to the wrestlers in the ring.
*  Partly because we were behind a curtain and partly because of the subwoofer reinforced
*  booms of wrestlers slamming each other onto the miked up canvas, speaking to him was
*  like meeting a less defensive but more distracted Wizard of Oz.
*  Khan regards the indie circuit as an invaluable source of talent.
*  I like to take people's presentation once it's gotten over, once it's gotten popular
*  and been accepted, he told me.
*  Getting over is a term of art.
*  Wrestlers are over when the audience starts enthusiastically responding to them, positively
*  or negatively.
*  If you find people that have gotten over with a smaller, hardcore audience, often if you
*  give them a chance on national television, the hardcore audience will vouch for them.
*  He was placing a big bet on this strategy Memorial Day weekend.
*  Khan had already kept Danhausen on the roster for months while an injury he sustained at
*  an indie event in Knoxville, Tennessee, a broken tibia and fibula, left him unable to
*  wrestle.
*  Now Khan had decided to make Danhausen's match the buy-in for AEW's annual Double or Nothing
*  event in Las Vegas, the first match of the event, which airs on free TV as an enticement
*  for ambivalent fans to buy the pay-per-view.
*  So not only would it be Danhausen's first major in-ring performance after returning from injury
*  in front of the largest crowd of his career.
*  At that point T-Mobile Arena had sold out at a little over 14,000 seats, but it would
*  also be of crucial importance to his new employer and set the tone for the biggest event in
*  company history.
*  Which would all be fine, Danhausen assured me, because the main lesson he had learned
*  from wrestling was that you couldn't really control what happened to you, but you could
*  maximize the opportunity in whatever did.
*  If you get cut and you have a minute, he said, you just make the most of your minute.
*  By 10.45 on Saturday morning, the line to meet Hangman Adam Page at the Double or Nothing
*  FanFest event in the Mandalay Bay Convention Center threatened to stretch past the logistically
*  important center of the room.
*  The line for the announcer and former wrestler Taz was the second longest, and Danhausen's
*  was third.
*  He stood at a cafe table at the end of a tension barrier shoot and steadily autographed
*  a stack of playing card-themed promotional photos AEW created for the event.
*  No cell phone pictures were allowed, but a company photographer was on hand to snap one
*  picture of him with each fan or group of fans.
*  He made the curse gesture for just about every photo.
*  Danhausen was in makeup, but not in character, a choice that seemed equally jarring and thrilling
*  to his admirers.
*  One fan brought him a copy of An American Werewolf in London on DVD, something Danhausen
*  already had, but not on Blu-ray, which the fan insisted was hard to find, and they conversed
*  briefly about the genius of David Naughton.
*  One element of Danhausen's appeal seems to be that the panoply of pop culture references
*  in his gimmick, to The Simpsons, to B-horror movies, to cartoons like The Venture Brothers
*  and Space Ghost, and to the shared inheritance of wrestling history, creates a series of
*  recognitions among fans who may not get what he is doing at first, but immediately understand
*  that the person doing it is somehow like them.
*  I think we're all weirdos, and they can connect with that, Danhausen said.
*  In a good way.
*  Good weird.
*  Die-hard wrestling fans seem to have some quality in common that is hard to describe,
*  but easy to recognize.
*  Over the course of the weekend, I approached any stranger who looked right and asked, Are
*  you in town for double or nothing?
*  I was right 100% of the time.
*  The business model's emphasis on t-shirts surely improved my average, but there were
*  other factors at play.
*  Many wrestling fans invoke signifiers from various subcultures, punk, goth, role-playing
*  games, the burlesque, rockabilly, roller derby triangle, without being definitively of any
*  one of them.
*  They wear a lot of ear gauges, and they exhibit the sweet diffidence of people who live some
*  of the more meaningful portions of their lives in fictional worlds.
*  The job of the professional wrestler is to make these people feel.
*  A job that requires an enormous amount of physical exertion and training, but ultimately
*  does not come down to athletic prowess so much as the ability to work a crowd.
*  The Rock, probably the biggest crossover star since Hulk Hogan, is an example of this principle.
*  He was not considered an extraordinarily skilled technical wrestler, and his finishing move
*  was an anticlimactic elbow drop.
*  But he developed a funny and compelling character, coining phrases that appeared on t-shirts
*  and wielding electrifying command of his audience.
*  Eventually he was so over with the fans that WWF seemed to have no choice but to make him
*  champion.
*  In addition to the predetermined outcomes of individual matches, pro wrestling follows
*  storylines that are planned out in advance by writers or, in the case of AEW, via a collective
*  effort by Khan, a handful of veteran hires and the wrestlers themselves.
*  But wrestling is nonetheless a competitive sport, because performers who consistently
*  receive big responses from fans will find themselves in more and bigger events.
*  Generally speaking, wrestlers advance toward the championship on the size of their pop,
*  the reaction they get from the crowd, which is real and ultimately beyond the control
*  of promoters.
*  Bill Brooks, who as CM Punk has held seven championships with four different promotions
*  and was AEW World Champion twice in 2022, described the process of developing a wrestling
*  persona as being repeatedly surprised by the reactions of the crowd, a feeling he characterized
*  as, I don't know why they like that, but they like it.
*  Sometimes the interplay between wrestlers and crowd can take a gimmick somewhere surprising
*  to both.
*  Dustin Rhodes, for example, got over to an astonishing degree in the late 1990s as the
*  bizarre heel Goldust, an androgynous, living Oscar who used wrestling as an opportunity
*  to sexually harass other men.
*  Rhodes solidified this gimmick midway through a circa 1995 match against Savio Vega, locking
*  up with him and briefly caressing his chest before rolling out of the ring.
*  Brooks described the crowd's reaction as the most evil hate I've ever heard, a concentrated
*  version of the heat it is a heel's job to generate.
*  As soon as he heard that response, he knew he had to commit to the character.
*  That's the first reaction I had gotten in six months, he told me.
*  It was hard, but once I did it, man, that night, it changed my life.
*  Danhausen can't cite a single night that changed his life the way Rhodes can.
*  He doesn't remember when the gimmick really clicked, but I keep thinking about a YouTube
*  video from 2019 in which he appears opposite one Pretty Boy Smooth in an event billed as
*  No Ring, No Rules, a wrestling match in a bar from which some but not all of the tables
*  have been removed, attended by about 30 people.
*  The room has that quiet sound that bedevils any show in front of a very small audience,
*  but Danhausen is fully committed.
*  Pretty Boy Smooth is the larger man, and at one point Danhausen tries to pick him up
*  and just can't.
*  It's a pleasing gag, not just the sight of Danhausen struggling to lift him, cartoon
*  style, but also knowing that he is faking struggling, really selling it, heaving himself
*  against the other man's weight with his hands immobile.
*  Of all the unlikely things wrestlers do with their bodies, you never see them do anything
*  like this, this buster-keaton physical language of mundane frustration.
*  You look at it and think, that's how it would go for me if I wound up in there.
*  We may never know what it is about a physically unimpressive misfit living in a fantasy world
*  that appeals to wrestling fans, but coming into Double or Nothing Memorial Day weekend,
*  Danhausen was finally, deliriously over.
*  On Sunday afternoon, roughly 90 minutes before he was set to enter the ring, Danhausen was
*  worried about his tights.
*  The custom pair he had had shipped to the FedEx office at Mandalay Bay the day before
*  small and made of some material intractable to AEW's team of traveling seamsters who
*  were at that moment sewing frantically at a row of machines they had set up in the hallway.
*  Danhausen had commissioned another set of tights from a local tailor who promised they
*  would be ready by showtime, but now that person had stopped answering his texts.
*  In response to these conditions, as in seemingly all things, Danhausen tried to maintain a
*  positive attitude, but even beneath the makeup, his face bore the expression of a man experiencing
*  only limited success in assuring himself that, when he walked down the ramp to the biggest
*  performance of his career, he would be fully clothed.
*  Danhausen's friend and fellow AEW wrestler Orange Cassidy assured him that he was so
*  over he could go out there in jeans, but Danhausen was worried about crack.
*  If a wrestler shows cleavage in the ring, the internet will not forget.
*  He texted again and then released his phone a little too vigorously onto the road box
*  around which we had gathered.
*  His parents were in town, he observed.
*  After what may have been ten of the longer minutes of his life, the man with the backup
*  tights arrived, and Danhausen returned to normal, unfocused, pre-show jitters.
*  For the last several weeks, he had been working a narrative in which he tried and failed to
*  befriend another wrestler named Hook, a storyline dubbed in tabloid style Hookhausen.
*  Hook's gimmick is essentially the same as that of my teenage son, Brooding, with high-volume
*  zoomer hair that hangs into his eyes and makes him seem either surly or deep, depending on
*  your demographic.
*  He is a thrilling in-ring wrestler who combines judo-influenced throws with explosive speed
*  and low body fat percentage, but his presentation is also deeply serious in a way that risks
*  shading over into unintentional comedy.
*  Pairing him with Danhausen was a genius move for which no one at AEW seemed willing to
*  take credit.
*  Khan would divulge only that,
*  a very smart person suggested it to me.
*  Shortly before Double or Nothing, Danhausen had finally secured Hook's approval in the
*  form of a symbolically important handshake, bringing to a climax a series of events that
*  not only bought Danhausen time to rehab his leg, but also set up the night's tag team
*  match which pit him and Hook against the premier athlete Tony Neese, a body guy who is not
*  above kissing his own biceps to rile up the crowd, and smart Mark Sterling Esquire, whose
*  improbable gimmick is that, even though he is a lawyer, he is not that smart.
*  Danhausen's goal for this match was, putting it crassly, to live up to the hype.
*  He wanted to prove that he was not just a fan favorite with good mic skills, but also
*  a talented wrestler who could work an audience from inside the ring.
*  Beyond that, it seemed as though he was still pleasantly surprised to be there.
*  He told me he had no interest in signing with WWE, the logical next step in any wrestler's
*  career, because he felt AEW was better suited to his act.
*  That was, of course, the correct thing to say, but it also seemed true.
*  For him, AEW is not the minor league so much as a place where Danhausen can be Danhausen
*  in front of an audience who appreciates what he is doing.
*  When his entrance music came bumping out of the speakers at T-Mobile Arena, a kitschy
*  riff on Saturday morning cartoon themes complete with a video package of hypnotic spirals and
*  floating depictions of his own head, approximately 14,000 such people stood up and cheered.
*  As he marched down the ramp in cape and mostly fitting tights, he seemed to take a moment
*  to drink it all in.
*  Mniag, he said, a sound of ghoulish delight.
*  Then he climbed through the ropes and did what he had planned to do, get thrown around
*  the ring by niece for the better part of four minutes, occasionally pulling off a spectacular
*  move but mostly being manhandled as he tried and failed to tag in hook in a series of near-misses
*  that teased the audience into a frenzy.
*  When he finally touched his younger partner's hand, the pop was enormous.
*  Hook made short work of niece, then dragged Sterling over the top rope and slammed him
*  into catatonia.
*  He was about to pin him and end the match when he turned and saw Danhausen frantically
*  calling for the tag.
*  After briefly consulting with the crowd, Hook tagged his partner in.
*  Danhausen marched across the ring, his face a mixture of triumph and shock, and planted
*  one foot on Sterling's chest.
*  He raised his hands and shouted along with the fans as they roared their approval.
*  The guy who stood no chance of winning had won.
*  It was exactly what was supposed to happen.
