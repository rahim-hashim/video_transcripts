# Antisemitism and Free Speech Collide on Campuses
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqqgsnx5vA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  The story behind a congressional hearing that ended the career of one university president
*  jeopardized the jobs of two others and kicked off an emotional debate about anti-Semitism
*  and free speech on college campuses.
*  I speak with my colleague, Nick Confessori.
*  It's Wednesday, December 13th.
*  Nick, thank you for coming in here.
*  It's good to be here, Michael.
*  I want you to give us the backstory that brings us to this now infamous congressional hearing
*  last week featuring several of the country's top college presidents and to the uproar that
*  this hearing ultimately ends up triggering.
*  Where does that story start?
*  It begins in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks.
*  When around the country campuses begin to be roiled by protests about the attacks, the
*  aftermath of the attacks, the Israeli response.
*  You had students chanting from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free, which
*  for some of the protesters were meant as more generic statements of Palestinian freedom.
*  But for many Jews, sound like calls for ethnic cleansing of Jews from Israel.
*  Because between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is Israel in its current borders.
*  Correct.
*  You had chants Intifada, Intifada, long live the Intifada, which is a word that means
*  uprising, but which many people, especially people of a certain age, sounds like an endorsement
*  of the violent tactics of the second Intifada suicide attacks.
*  A glorious October 7th.
*  Yes!
*  And at least some of these events.
*  I remember feeling so empowered that victory was near and so tangible.
*  You could hear speakers who were praising the attacks of October 7th.
*  It was exhilarating!
*  It was exhilarating!
*  It was energizing!
*  Endorsing them, celebrating them.
*  And there was one vivid example at UCLA where students battered a pi√±ata of Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  the prime minister of Israel, while a woman chanted, beat that Jew.
*  A lot of those moments were seen by millions of people who wouldn't otherwise tune in to
*  what's happening on these campuses.
*  And for Jews on these campuses, these videos and images often made them feel unsafe, even
*  if they weren't intended that way by the students.
*  On top of that, donors and alumni are seeing them.
*  They're getting really, really upset.
*  And they start making calls and they start to write emails.
*  Right.
*  And those calls and those emails basically say what?
*  Just from the beginning, you were hearing from donors and alumni who felt that the response
*  of these college presidents was not forceful enough.
*  They wanted a real intervention.
*  They wanted powerful statements that the behavior they were seeing on these videos was not okay,
*  was not accepted at these institutions.
*  And so against that backdrop, Republicans in the House of Representatives decide that
*  they're going to do something about it.
*  They're going to hold a hearing on campus anti-Semitism.
*  And they invite the presidents of three universities, Elizabeth McGill from the University of Pennsylvania,
*  Claudine Gay from Harvard, and Sally Kornbluth from MIT.
*  And why did the Republicans invite these three university presidents of all the university
*  presidents in the country?
*  It's not entirely clear why they picked these three schools.
*  In fact, there have been incidents like this at lower profile schools all around the country.
*  But what they all have in common is that they are high profile institutions.
*  They are considered the elite of academia.
*  And making it about them makes it a really big story.
*  Right.
*  And heading into this hearing, what exactly were these congressional Republicans up to?
*  What are their aims for getting these three prestigious college presidents before them?
*  Well, if you pull back a little bit, think how over the last couple of years, Republicans
*  and conservatives have tried to make the case that there is something seriously wrong in
*  academia and that they need to do something about it.
*  And for many months this year, this was at the center of the Republican primary for president.
*  Right.
*  Attacks on quote unquote, wokeism.
*  Attacks on critical race theory.
*  An overemphasis on race and oppression.
*  And in their minds and in their argument, those ideas are at the heart of what we saw
*  on those campuses.
*  And they saw an opportunity to make that case and make that point to the American public
*  after a few months in which it seemed that a lot of voters in particular had stopped
*  tuning into those arguments.
*  So they're going to try to make a direct link between this liberal culture on college campuses,
*  which they've been denouncing, and this anti-Israeli rhetoric they're seeing on campuses.
*  They're going to suggest that those two things are inextricably bound up together.
*  Yes.
*  So how does the hearing actually start?
*  Good morning.
*  The Committee on Education and Workforce will come to order.
*  So the way it begins and the part you didn't see on the newscasts that night was each of
*  the college presidents.
*  We at Harvard reject anti-Semitism and denounce any trace of it on our campus or within our
*  community.
*  Forcefully denouncing anti-Semitism.
*  Let me reiterate my and Penn's unyielding commitment to combatting it.
*  Saying that this kind of rhetoric is hurtful.
*  We have increased security measures, expanded reporting channels, and augmented counseling,
*  mental health, and support services.
*  Here are the steps we are taking to combat anti-Semitism on our campuses.
*  While I deplore all hateful speech, anti-Semitic speech remains in America protected.
*  But we also have to protect free speech on campus and allow people to say things, even
*  when we find them objectionable.
*  We need both safety and free expression for universities and ultimately democracy to thrive.
*  And they were trying to set up this idea that people are going to say things you don't
*  agree with, even terrible things you don't agree with, and the values of our university
*  can be thought of as separate from the speech that we allow as an academic institution.
*  And they seem to want to distinguish between free speech and harassment.
*  I watched the hearing.
*  They're trying to say some free speech is just free speech.
*  Sometimes it's harassment, but that's a really important distinction.
*  That speech that incites violence is unacceptable.
*  Yes, what they're trying to say is, when do we take action against a student as an institution
*  for something they say?
*  Well, it has to cross a certain threshold.
*  It has to be pervasive.
*  It has to be harassment.
*  They were saying what is actually true under the law.
*  They were expressing how things should work on these campuses.
*  And the problem for these presidents is that that is not how it actually works on these
*  campuses.
*  And that is where the Republicans went next.
*  Okay, explain that.
*  I now recognize Mr. Banks.
*  So if you focus on Penn for a second, we saw in the questioning people like Congressman
*  Jim Banks.
*  And for the past year, your administration has sought to punish Amy Wax.
*  Begin to float examples of conservative speakers who had been heckled or shut down or disfavored
*  in some way on some of these college campuses.
*  He talked about how the university is currently trying to sanction Amy Wax, a law professor.
*  Her stance on DEI and identity issues.
*  For comments she made about the performance of black students in her classes.
*  And then you canceled an event with former ICE director Tom Homan due to disruptive...
*  And he said a few years ago, a Trump administration immigration official tried to come speak at
*  Penn and students there basically shut down the speech because they felt that he was bringing
*  anti-immigration and a nativist rhetoric to campus.
*  On the other hand, there are examples where Penn seemed to act less decisively.
*  Penn hosted a Palestine rights literature festival.
*  For example, this fall before the October 7th attacks, Penn played host to a Palestinian
*  literary festival where speakers included Roger Waters, who's the former Pink Floyd
*  frontman.
*  The same Roger Waters, by the way, who's publicly used anti-Jewish slurs and has dressed up
*  as a Nazi and floated a pig balloon with the Star of David at most, at many of his concerts.
*  And in fact, Penn did issue a statement saying, you find some of the rhetoric objectionable.
*  It's not because it isn't what our values, but they're allowed to have this event.
*  So I think in the eyes of Republicans, one event is allowed to go ahead and the other
*  is essentially canceled.
*  And so they see that these standards are not really being applied evenly.
*  And the way that they're not being applied evenly, according to this Republican congressman,
*  is that when Republican speakers, conservative minded guests, are coming to campus, there's
*  a willingness to shut things down, to quiet it, when it's more liberal minded speakers,
*  like this pro-Palestinian speaker, greater allowances are made.
*  That's what the Republicans are claiming.
*  And here's why this moment is so powerful, Michael.
*  There just aren't that many conservatives on these campuses anymore.
*  The student bodies tend to be pretty liberal and the professors tend to be very liberal
*  in terms of their distribution of political affiliation.
*  It's mostly Democrats and liberals, not Republicans and conservatives.
*  So when speech happens that annoys conservatives on these campuses, there aren't protests,
*  there aren't real efforts to shut them down.
*  But there are a lot of Jewish people on these campuses.
*  And one of the things that made this moment so powerful and important and useful politically
*  on the Republican side was that they could really put the shoe on the other foot in a
*  way that would appeal to an audience much broader than liberals who care on principle
*  about free speech.
*  They could expand the audience of people who might say there's something wrong at these
*  places because they had examples here that weren't about a conservative from an unpopular
*  administration who wasn't allowed to talk about policy there.
*  They have harmful rhetoric towards Jews on elite college campuses.
*  Mr. Grossman, you're recognized for five minutes.
*  Thank you.
*  And there was one very interesting moment when a congressman named Glenn Groffman jumped
*  in and he talked about this issue of ideological diversity on these campuses.
*  Or lack of it.
*  Or lack of it.
*  In 2016, they found about 2 percent.
*  And he said, look, in 2016, there's one survey that said that only about 2 percent of the
*  faculty at Harvard had a positive view of President Trump.
*  And he asked.
*  Does it concern you at all that you apparently have a lack of ideological diversity at Harvard?
*  How can you really have true diversity of ideas and thought on a campus where almost
*  everybody hates President Trump?
*  Right.
*  The man who, based on the math, was elected president in 2016.
*  Basically, he's saying your campuses are deeply out of sync with the rest of the country.
*  If half the country voted for this guy, give or take, but only 2 percent of your faculty
*  has a favorable impression of him.
*  What does that say about how Harvard reflects the perspectives of America as a whole?
*  And could it be that that lack of ideological diversity is part of the problem we see here
*  today with these protests on campus?
*  So Republicans were trying to make the case that these liberal-minded universities have,
*  in their minds, an anti-Semitism problem.
*  They're doing it in a few ways.
*  One of them is saying that these schools do know how to clamp down on speech that their
*  students and their faculty don't like right-wing speech because they've done it.
*  Which in a sense, these Republicans, they make these universities kind of hypocritical
*  when it comes to speech that is upsetting to Jews.
*  Another point these Republicans are making is that anti-Semitism might be the logical
*  outcome, they claim, of having a liberal monoculture that permeates these schools without
*  any kind of check or balance from Republicans and conservatives.
*  Correct.
*  And then we come to this pivotal moment.
*  Madam Chair, I'd like to yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from New York.
*  Elise Stefanik, a congresswoman from New York and a Harvard alumni herself, by the way,
*  asks a question that is designed to highlight what the Republicans on the Panel see as the
*  hypocrisy of these policies on campus.
*  She asks,
*  Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate MIT's...
*  Is it okay for a student to call for the genocide of Jews at your institutions?
*  Is a call for the genocide of Jews protected speech on your campus?
*  And that produced the moment that I would say this hearing was designed to produce.
*  A moment where...
*  Calling for the genocide of Jews is anti-Semitic.
*  So yes.
*  And that is anti-Semitic speech.
*  And as I've said...
*  And it's a yes.
*  When speech crosses into conduct...
*  And it's a yes, I've asked the witnesses to be...
*  When speech crosses into conduct, we take action.
*  So is that a yes?
*  Is that a yes?
*  The witness hasn't answered.
*  Madam Chair, is that a yes?
*  You cannot answer the question.
*  These three credentialed elite academics, the heads of some of these great institutions
*  of American academic life, were wishy-washy and couldn't get out the words,
*  calling for genocide is bad.
*  And there was this really incredible exchange...
*  Ms. McGill at Penn...
*  Between Stefanik and the president of the University of Pennsylvania.
*  Rules or code of conduct, yes or no?
*  If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment, yes.
*  I am asking...
*  Where Stefanik kept saying, is calling for the genocide of Jews, killing them all because
*  of their Jews?
*  In other words, does that constitute bullying or harassment?
*  Right.
*  If it is directed and severe or pervasive, it is harassment.
*  So the answer is yes.
*  It is a context-dependent decision, Congresswoman.
*  And McGill kept replying with this kind of bureaucratic language.
*  It's context-dependent.
*  This is the easiest question to answer.
*  Yes, Ms. McGill.
*  If you're talking about this in the context of how do you govern and regulate speech on
*  campus, that might be an appropriate answer.
*  But at this moment, what the hearing was about was, is it okay to call for the genocide of
*  Jews at Harvard?
*  Right.
*  So, is your testimony that you will not answer yes?
*  If it is...
*  Yes or no?
*  If the speech becomes conduct, it can be harassment, yes.
*  She doesn't seem to appreciate, and in fact, all three didn't seem to appreciate in that
*  moment that they were being asked a moral question.
*  Instead, they are interpreting it entirely as a legal question.
*  And the gap between the two becomes very clear in the answer.
*  Before that, they were being asked a legal question that could be cast as a moral answer.
*  And that was what made this moment so damaging for them.
*  And what do people take from these answers once the hearing is over and they start spreading
*  across the internet?
*  The calls for these leaders to resign after these answers grew very, very intense.
*  And more and more people online, more and more donors and alumni are saying, if you
*  can't give a straightforward answer to this question, you should not be the president
*  of Harvard or MIT or the University of Pennsylvania.
*  You don't deserve that job.
*  You're the wrong person.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Nick, what happens to these three college presidents from Penn, MIT, and Harvard after
*  this hearing amid all these calls to step down?
*  The fallout comes very swiftly.
*  Within a few days, 70 members of Congress are calling for all three presidents to resign.
*  And in some ways, the most pressure is on Liz McGill, president of UPenn, where the
*  donors and the school's board members are the most outspoken and active at this moment.
*  And because her response was the most viral of the videos that came out of the hearing.
*  And she responds in part with a recorded video of her own.
*  There was a moment during yesterday's congressional hearing on anti-Semitism.
*  An apology video.
*  When I was asked if a call for the genocide of Jewish people on our campus would violate
*  our policies.
*  She talks about essentially being too legalistic and not speaking clearly enough on this important
*  question of whether genocide is okay.
*  It's evil, plain and simple.
*  Right.
*  She basically says, I screwed up during that hearing.
*  In her video, you get the sense that she understands her job is on the line.
*  We must initiate a serious and careful look at our policies.
*  And Provost Jackson and I will immediately convene a process to do so.
*  Thank you.
*  And it is because behind the scenes, donors and board members at the University of Pennsylvania
*  are rallying and organizing and trying to force her out.
*  And within a few days, they succeed and Liz McGill resigns.
*  And what about the presidents of MIT and Harvard?
*  Well, they are under similar pressure.
*  There are calls for them to resign too.
*  And here, I think, is where Republicans, including Elise Stefanik, make a mistake.
*  She tweets, one down, two to go.
*  Then you begin to understand that this is in fact a bit of political theater.
*  That it has a political purpose.
*  And it forced the people in these institutions who actually have the authority to make this
*  decision, who actually picked the presidents of these schools, to decide whose interests
*  would really be served if they forced out the leaders of their institutions.
*  And what happens in the ensuing days is the board of MIT says, Karen Kornbluth has our
*  confidence.
*  We're not getting rid of her.
*  We're not getting rid of her.
*  And not long after, the board at Harvard comes to the same kind of decision.
*  And they say that the events of recent days have not shaken their confidence that Claudine
*  Gay is the right person to lead Harvard.
*  So in a way, these House Republicans, typified, it seems, by Congresswoman Stefanik, who Nick
*  you've written about a lot for the Times, they kind of overplayed their hands and revealed
*  that what they're up to here is a lot more complicated, as you've hinted at, than getting
*  to the bottom of whether there's an anti-Semitism problem on college campuses or a free speech
*  problem on college campuses.
*  That's right, Michael.
*  I think there are multiple agendas at work here.
*  First of all, let's remind listeners, Elise Stefanik is not only a Harvard grad, but she
*  sat on the board of their prestigious Institute of Politics until the 2020 election.
*  And after the election, she made so many false statements about the election results in the
*  service of trying to help Donald Trump overturn the election, that there was a petition calling
*  for her ouster from the board.
*  I remember this now.
*  And she was pushed off of the board of an institution she had once loved and been groomed
*  for her political career.
*  So she's pushed out of a position she loved at Harvard, basically because she lied about
*  the 2020 election.
*  Exactly.
*  And when she was pushed out, she put out this defiant statement saying that Harvard had
*  decided to, quote, cave to the woke left, and that she would wear being kicked off the
*  board as a, quote, badge of honor.
*  And you begin to sense that there is more at play here than just this rhetoric about
*  openness and dialogue.
*  Right.
*  And the motivations here, especially in going after a place like Harvard that in her mind
*  has done her wrong, they're messy.
*  That's right.
*  And I think Stefanik is also an example of a broader problem that Republicans have been
*  wrestling with in their coalition, which is anti-Semitic and nativist ideas among some
*  of their supporters.
*  Okay, explain that.
*  In recent years, what was once a fringe ideology of the very far right, something called Great
*  Replacement Theory has crept into the Republican mainstream.
*  And the most extreme version of this theory is that there is a conspiracy of global elites
*  to turn white civilizations and countries into brown ones through immigration.
*  And often in the most extreme versions of this, the Jews are pulling the strings.
*  The Jews are part of a conspiracy to undermine Western civilization by replacing white Americans
*  or white Europeans with immigrants from Africa, from Asia, from the Middle East.
*  Right.
*  We've talked about this on the show.
*  It's seen as responsible for some of the anti-Semitic violence on the American right.
*  That's right.
*  And in fact, we've had three mass shootings in recent years in this country where the
*  shooters wrote about replacement theory, seemed to be inspired by replacement theory.
*  The most popular cable host in the country up until this year, Tucker Carlson, was also
*  one of the great popularizers and mainstreamers of replacement theory.
*  On his show, you can hear that rhetoric all the time, that Democrats in cahoots with big
*  business and some Republicans were trying to replace the native born population of America
*  with immigrants for political power.
*  And Elise Stefanik herself has delved into these waters.
*  How?
*  her campaign released Facebook ads that essentially borrowed and echoed elements of replacement
*  theory.
*  Hmm.
*  She got bashed for this.
*  Of course she was defiant.
*  But it shows you how, if you think about all the discussion that replacement theory has
*  caused in the media, on this show and around the country, you can understand that this
*  hearing was a chance to kind of flip the script and reset that conversation for Republicans
*  and say, see, the real problem with anti-Semitism, the real anti-Semites are at elite universities.
*  Got it.
*  In other words, Republicans are very eager to redirect this conversation about anti-Semitism
*  to being a problem of the left, not just the right.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And I think we should also look at the broader context here.
*  While the subject here is partly about who gets to say what, right?
*  Should we have free speech?
*  All around the country in state legislatures, Republicans are passing bans on teaching critical
*  race theory and defining that theory in pretty broad ways.
*  In Florida, professors are no longer allowed to talk about systemic racism in core classes.
*  It's been banned.
*  It's been banned.
*  By Republican administration.
*  Yeah.
*  And so, you know, there are obviously a lot of principal defenders of free speech on the
*  left and in the center.
*  But I think some skepticism is warranted in this moment because rather than saying we
*  should have more pluralism in these universities, we should accept all viewpoints.
*  There are many people on the right at the moment who want to replace one ideology with
*  another.
*  Which is another way of saying that when it comes to academic free speech, there is some
*  hypocrisy on both sides, not just on the left, but also on the right.
*  I think there is an incredible amount of hypocrisy around free speech issues in every institution
*  in American life.
*  Well, regardless of why Republicans seized on this moment and held this hearing, Nick,
*  if you just embrace for the moment that universities are struggling with the question of free speech,
*  when to embrace it, when to regulate it, I wonder where this now leads.
*  Once a president of university is ousted over this, once two other university presidents
*  jobs have been put on the line, even if they are spared, where do we think this goes?
*  Does it lead to more free speech or does it lead to more regulation of free speech on
*  these campuses?
*  We have been moving in the direction of more regulation of campus speech for a long time
*  now.
*  I think for a long time, liberals led that charge.
*  And I think that conservatives, some conservatives have given up on the idea of fighting for
*  neutrality on these questions and have resolved that if there has to be a choice, then they're
*  going to enforce conservative speech restrictions and content restrictions on college campuses.
*  Kind of match what's going on in their minds on the left.
*  You know, the other option for everybody is to make a decision as an institution, as a
*  society that we're going to be offended sometimes.
*  People are going to say things we don't like.
*  They're going to lie.
*  They're going to mislead.
*  They're going to say, I shouldn't exist.
*  They're going to be hateful and make a decision that maybe we have to let that happen and
*  police it less.
*  Because that in theory is the true meaning of free speech, as painful as it clearly is.
*  I think free speech is often painful.
*  And we have worked away from that ideal in a lot of places in public life.
*  But you know, the idea that I'm going to have to be offended once in a while, even really
*  offended, even feel that somebody is against who I am on some fundamental level.
*  I think the choice that we all have to make is, is it better in the end to do less to
*  regulate that kind of thing and embrace all the pain and complexity that may result?
*  And do we believe that that makes for a healthier society?
*  Based on what you're saying, it doesn't seem that's the direction we're headed in towards
*  a pure version of free speech on campus.
*  It doesn't to me.
*  And what I see is an expanding circle of things that you're not supposed to say in these environments,
*  not a shrinking one, but an expanding one.
*  And it seems like that's the way we're heading.
*  The notion that the administrations of these universities should try to remain neutral
*  on moral and political questions and let everyone speak their perspective seems less and less
*  in favor.
*  And it feels like we're moving more in the opposite direction to a future in which in
*  any given institution, whichever political side has the most power, gets to decide what
*  speech is really allowed.
*  Well, Nick, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, President Biden delivered his most forceful critique to date of Israel's
*  military tactics in Gaza, saying that because of them, Israel's government was losing the
*  support of the international community.
*  The remarks delivered to donors off camera in Washington was a turning point for Biden,
*  who since the October 7 attacks on Israel has left criticism of Israel's response
*  to his deputies, even as the number of civilian deaths in Gaza has mounted.
*  And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, where
*  his pleas for quick approval of more military assistance hit a brick wall of resistance
*  from congressional Republicans.
*  Ukraine House Speaker Mike Johnson said that members of his party had seen little evidence
*  that Ukraine has a real plan to defeat Russia.
*  I have asked the White House since the day that I was handed the gavel as speaker for
*  clarity.
*  We need a clear articulation of the strategy to allow Ukraine to win.
*  And thus far, their responses have been insufficient.
*  And that without such a plan, it doesn't make sense to keep giving Ukraine more money as
*  President Biden has requested.
*  What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars
*  with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win.
*  And none of the answers that I think the American people are owed.
*  Biden has warned that unless Congress approves more funding by the end of the year, which
*  seems increasingly unlikely, Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia will be in
*  serious jeopardy.
