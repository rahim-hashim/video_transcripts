Video Description: Over the past week, President Donald J. Trump dramatically ceded the stage to Elon Musk in the Oval Office, turned the democratic mayor of New York City into a political pawn and ensured that Vladimir Putin begins peace talks with Ukraine on Russiaâ€™s terms.

The Times journalists Michael Barbaro, Maggie Haberman, David E. Sanger and Zolan Kanno-Youngs sit down and discuss the latest week in the Trump administration.

# Trump's Power Plays: Musk in the Oval, a Gift to Mayor Adams and a Win for Putin | 'The Daily'
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=0.0s)]
*  It is Friday, February 14th. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=6.88s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=9.28s)]
*  Friends, welcome back to the roundtable. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=11.28s)]
*  But first, happy Valentine's Day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=15.0s)]
*  Happy Valentine's Day, Michael. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=17.32s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=18.32s)]
*  Happy Valentine's Day, Michael. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=19.32s)]
*  Happy to spend it with you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=20.6s)]
*  I mean, who else would you spend it with? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=21.6s)]
*  I can think of one person. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=25.96s)]
*  I can too. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  I can too. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm a wonderful husband. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  I do. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  David, appreciate you joining us from Munich. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=31.159999999999997s)]
*  I was going to say from Paris, City of Love. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  That was the plan, but you changed location since we... [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=36.08s)]
*  That was two days ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=39.92s)]
*  That was two days ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=40.92s)]
*  With Vice President Vance, yeah? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=41.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=43.92s)]
*  You've been traveling with the Vice President. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=44.92s)]
*  Zolan and Maggie, appreciate you coming to us from our studio in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=45.92s)]
*  I just want to set up this conversation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  Loosely speaking, our theme this week is projections of power, exercises of power by the Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=52.44s)]
*  administration, both overseas and here at home. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=57.96s)]
*  And we're going to start here at home. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=61.76s)]
*  It feels like the story of this presidency so far is the extraordinary wielding of power [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=64.16s)]
*  by President Trump and a remarkable wielding of power by Elon Musk, private citizen and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=70.32s)]
*  the world's richest man. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=76.64s)]
*  And they've been happening simultaneously and seemingly a little bit independently. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=78.16s)]
*  This week, we saw those two things come together in a very vivid and at times weird way in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=83.0s)]
*  the Oval Office. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Maggie, for anyone who didn't see this or watch it, can you just describe this scene? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=91.44s)]
*  It was pretty remarkable, Michael. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=98.24s)]
*  Elon Musk joined Donald Trump in the Oval Office with Elon Musk's four-year-old child [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  named X, just like the social media website that used to be Twitter that Elon Musk has [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=107.76s)]
*  renamed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=112.64s)]
*  And it was for an executive order signing related to how DOGE, Musk's so-called cost [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=113.64s)]
*  cutting initiative, interacts with the hiring process in the federal government. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=119.4s)]
*  And Trump really just turned it over to Musk. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=123.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to ask Elon to tell you a little bit about it and some of the things that we [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  found, which is shocking. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=130.72s)]
*  And Musk just held forth for many, many minutes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=133.36s)]
*  I think it was much of the roughly 30-minute event. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  And he described what he's doing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=146.96s)]
*  He kept talking about all of the so-called fraud and waste and abuse that he says they [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=149.12s)]
*  have found. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  A bunch of the fraud rings that are operating in the United States and taking advantage [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  of the federal government. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  A striking allegation for which he provided no evidence and still has not, as far as I [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=159.2s)]
*  know, was that some government workers were taking kickbacks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=164.2s)]
*  I believe it was specifically of USAID spending. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=167.76s)]
*  But Trump was relegated to sort of a spectator in his own office, just sitting at the desk [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=172.76s)]
*  and nodding and occasionally chiming in and criticizing judges. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=178.48s)]
*  And what was really striking about it, Michael, is that it looked to those of us who have [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=181.72s)]
*  watched him for a long time as if Trump was not enjoying this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  I talked to a number of his advisors afterwards. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=188.72s)]
*  They said he was fine with it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  They said that he... [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  And I don't think that they're making it up. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that he was defending his guy, Elon Musk, who has gone above and beyond in many [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=194.68s)]
*  ways to try to prove loyalty to Trump. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=202.52s)]
*  And Trump really likes having the richest man in the world seeking his approval. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=205.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=209.36s)]
*  Well, Zolan and David, I want to bring you in. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=210.36s)]
*  What immediately stood out about this scene was not just the fact that Elon Musk was there [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=211.36s)]
*  defending and justifying his unusual role. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=217.64s)]
*  It was just the fact of him holding court next to a sitting President Trump for 30 minutes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=221.64s)]
*  in this room that is the very definition of American presidential power. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=227.55999999999997s)]
*  It was the stature that it conferred on Musk. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=232.32s)]
*  And you all know this, but there's been this running motif that Musk is a kind of co-president. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  And Time Magazine went so far over the past couple of days as to put Musk on the cover [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=241.0s)]
*  of its latest issue, sitting behind the resolute desk with a coffee mug in his hand. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=245.28s)]
*  So this didn't seem to combat that or did it? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=249.95999999999998s)]
*  I cover the White House now, but I used to cover a cabinet agency during Trump round [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=254.64s)]
*  one. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=260.44s)]
*  And I remember covering that cabinet agency. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=261.44s)]
*  Officials used to talk about all the time how if they were going to do an announcement, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=263.64s)]
*  can I have a policy change? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=266.96s)]
*  Trump needed the spotlight. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=268.96s)]
*  They were very conscious about that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=270.88s)]
*  So to see this scene of the richest man in the world standing in front of cameras, articulating [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=272.52s)]
*  this real attempt to reshape the federal bureaucracy into something that's in Trump's image. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  It was something that I didn't think I would see covering Trump round one. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=290.84s)]
*  I'd never seen anything like it covering five presidents. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  I would have to say that two things really jumped out at me. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=300.44s)]
*  The first was that I think one of the reasons that Trump let this go on was that he thought [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=304.0s)]
*  that having the world's richest man talk about this cost cutting move gave him some credibility, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=309.0s)]
*  added to the cred of what was going on. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=315.96s)]
*  Who got the credibility? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=318.28s)]
*  That Trump got credibility from having Musk saying basically, I'm bringing the cost cutting [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=319.88s)]
*  strategies of X and Tesla and SpaceX and those efficiencies to your government and doing [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  this on a scale that has never been done before. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=333.88s)]
*  The second part that was fascinating to me was what was missing from it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  What was missing from it was what is the purpose of having these government agencies? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  What is the purpose of government? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=349.08s)]
*  In describing USAID, which I think has some of the most courageous people I have ever [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=351.8s)]
*  met in the US government going out in the world, putting themselves in danger on the front line [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  with none of the weapons that the US military goes out and has at those moments. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  Instead, he was basically describing them as people on the tape. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  There seems to be an interesting thing happening where the president and Elon Musk believe that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  to justify their cost cutting, they need to find and highlight corruption. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=379.0s)]
*  Just egregious cases of bad behavior when it seems for the most part that's probably not [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=384.52s)]
*  what they're going to find. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=391.8s)]
*  Why is it that they're having such a hard time just saying we want to cut government [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=393.4s)]
*  because we want to cut government? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=397.08s)]
*  Why do they feel the need to brand everything as corrupt, as kickbacks, to make claims that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=399.0s)]
*  so malign the workforce for which there's no evidence? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=405.64s)]
*  Well, at least there may be evidence, but they have not shared it with us. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=409.8s)]
*  Number one, it's Donald Trump's default setting is to call things corrupt when he doesn't like them, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=413.24s)]
*  to call things corrupt when they disagree with him. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=418.68s)]
*  I do think that Trump is very radicalized about the government he is leading. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  I think that has happened since the investigations into him in his first term. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=425.32s)]
*  I think since the multiple criminal indictments he faced, all of the civil cases that he faced. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=429.4s)]
*  I do think that Trump's contempt for the federal government is genuine. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=434.36s)]
*  Trump comes historically from a period in time and a place, New York, 1960s, 70s, 80s, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=440.76s)]
*  that was run by machine politics, where lots of aspects of government, frankly, some aspects of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=447.88s)]
*  the media, some aspects of the real estate industry, were tinged with corruption. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=453.32s)]
*  And Trump's sort of basic belief, and we hear him articulate this in various ways, is, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  everything is a little corrupt. And he is suggesting in this case, it's a lot. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=464.92s)]
*  The question also asked, why can't they just say this is about cutting government? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=468.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=473.48s)]
*  I mean, we know from reporting this is not just about cutting the fat off of government. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=473.88s)]
*  That this is not just about limiting federal spending, that this is also about getting people [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=478.12s)]
*  in office that will implement your agenda without asking questions, without putting up a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=483.72s)]
*  bureaucratic hurdle, which is the way the federal government was also designed in a way, too. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=488.44000000000005s)]
*  So it's not just about cutting spending. For him right now, it seems like the definition of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=492.52000000000004s)]
*  corruption is also changing. Corruption, as you were just saying, can be a policy difference. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=498.20000000000005s)]
*  And there's one other element. If you're going to cut fat, you're going to cut it with a sharp [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=503.16s)]
*  knife of some kind, and you're going to preserve the best part. That's not what they're doing here. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=508.76s)]
*  By going out and finding all of the probationary federal workers, these are usually workers who've [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=515.96s)]
*  been in their jobs for less than two years, they're doing something easy because you can [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=522.28s)]
*  get rid of probationary workers for any reason you want, without looking at the fact that that [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=528.12s)]
*  probably includes some of the most talented, technologically savvy young workers that they [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  are bringing into the federal government. Right. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=541.08s)]
*  So you're not lining up your needs with your cuts. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=543.08s)]
*  I just want to close out this conversation about Elon Musk because this idea, this motif [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=548.2s)]
*  of a co-presidency is so much in the air. I just want to get some clarity on this. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=553.32s)]
*  Maggie, is there a version of this where we should see Trump giving Elon Musk this kind of a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=557.88s)]
*  platform as him actually exerting some power over Musk? I mean, if you watch the president set it [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=563.24s)]
*  up, he said, I've asked Elon Musk to come here to offer a few remarks. And even though Trump was [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=568.68s)]
*  sitting there at their resolute desk, not saying much during the entire time Musk was talking, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=574.52s)]
*  he was sitting at the resolute desk. That's his desk. It was very clear he was the president. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=578.52s)]
*  Is there a way of flipping this around a little bit and seeing this as him kind of bringing Musk [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  to heel? Oh, 100%. I think the way you just described it is exactly it. Is Musk showing [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=588.44s)]
*  some level of dutiful obligation to Donald Trump? There's no question. And to that point, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  I would just add a sort of remarkable point that emerged this week. The Wall Street Journal first [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=600.36s)]
*  reported it and we confirmed it. X, which is owned by Musk, settled for multi-million dollars. We [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=604.44s)]
*  don't know the exact figure. It's somewhere in the area of $10 million. A lawsuit that Trump had [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=612.04s)]
*  brought against the site when it was Twitter owned by other people when his account was banned after [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=616.28s)]
*  January 6th, 2021. So essentially the site, I don't know exactly how the finances of X work in terms [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=622.36s)]
*  of Musk's ownership, et cetera, but this is his website and it has now paid Donald Trump a [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=628.04s)]
*  substantial amount of money. And Trump could have said, let's not do that. Right, you're working [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=635.0s)]
*  for me now. Not a big deal. Right. That's not what happened evidently. Wow. I didn't know that over [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=641.4s)]
*  the past week, among all the remarkable things, Elon Musk essentially cut a check to Donald Trump [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  for many millions of dollars. So Musk and Doge, all this cost cutting and conflict of interest, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=651.48s)]
*  risked overshadowing something else really important that happened this week, which is that the Trump [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=656.52s)]
*  administration, its Justice Department, asked prosecutors in New York to drop sweeping federal [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=660.92s)]
*  corruption charges against the city's mayor here, Eric Adams. Maggie, you've covered this story [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=668.04s)]
*  very closely. Can you just remind us very briefly of the basics of this case and how we got to this [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=674.12s)]
*  point where the Trump administration is demanding that charges for a big city democratic mayor [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=680.28s)]
*  be dropped? Michael, there are so many inputs as how we got here. So I will just try to do the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=688.36s)]
*  short version. I trust you to do this. I appreciate you. And you'll let me know if I don't get there. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=693.64s)]
*  Eric Adams was indicted on corruption charges in September of 2024. The basics or bribery [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=698.04s)]
*  involves airline ticket upgrades and essentially a quid pro quo with a foreign government, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=704.04s)]
*  Turkey in particular. Trump started talking in December about possibly pardoning Adams. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=709.56s)]
*  He had treated Adams as a fellow traveler in what Trump calls the weaponized justice system. Adams [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=715.56s)]
*  has also started trying to forge a very clear relationship with Trump. He went down to Palm [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=722.68s)]
*  Beach to meet with him. And in January, the SDNY, the prosecutors in Manhattan, federal prosecutors, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=727.88s)]
*  filed a court filing saying that they had uncovered evidence of additional criminal [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=736.68s)]
*  conduct by Adams. That signaled there could be more charges filed. That could be more serious. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=742.12s)]
*  Trump clearly does not think the charges against Adams as they are now are serious. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=748.68s)]
*  And earlier this week, the acting deputy attorney general, who is one of Donald Trump's many [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=753.0s)]
*  personal lawyers and is now in that role, directed the Southern District to dismiss the case, drop [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=758.76s)]
*  the charges. It does require a judge doing it, but also said that they would leave open a review of [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=765.2399999999999s)]
*  the case until after the November, 2025 mayoral election. So it's not dead. It's just not happening [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=770.68s)]
*  right now. As they say in that memo that it has impeded Adams ability to do his job, including [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=776.76s)]
*  helping on their immigration crackdown in New York. So when you're not in your head, there seems to be [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=783.16s)]
*  a quid pro quo implied here, which is that is not by the way, to be clear, but yes, the implied [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=788.04s)]
*  give and take here is that the Democratic mayor of America's biggest city will become an ally of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=795.4s)]
*  the president. And most importantly, not a critic of things like his immigration agenda, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=802.28s)]
*  if and once this administration drops these charges. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=808.04s)]
*  I thought this was really a takeaway that there actually wasn't an assessment in this memo on the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=811.8s)]
*  evidence of this case, but the takeaway was rather an assessment, a political assessment really of [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=817.24s)]
*  how Eric Adams would be able to implement Trump's immigration crackdown. That was explicitly said. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=823.8s)]
*  They explicitly said that they weren't making this decision based on the evidence, in fact, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=830.12s)]
*  which was extraordinary. I just want to be clear what you guys are saying. The justice department [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=833.56s)]
*  in saying they think these charges should be dropped, basically said we'd really like to work [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=836.92s)]
*  with this mayor to conduct immigration raids and get undocumented immigrants out of New York City. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=841.3199999999999s)]
*  And we see this case as a hurdle in order to doing that. That was the primary reason. And it's worth [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=847.3199999999999s)]
*  noting that Eric Adams as well was one of the few Democrats, one of the earliest Democrats to [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=853.24s)]
*  attack the previous administration over immigration made a lot of noise, which this current president [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=859.24s)]
*  also noticed. It's also worth noting that Eric Adams' lawyer is also Elon Musk's lawyer, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=865.32s)]
*  Alex Spyro. Blowing my mind just a little bit. David, for many people, this scenario is pretty [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=869.64s)]
*  straightforwardly a subversion of the normal system of justice in the country. Putting that aside for [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=875.48s)]
*  a moment, if you wish to, just as importantly, it would seem to make the mayor of New York City [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=882.04s)]
*  something of a, and I'm going to use this word and you all can correct me if you think it's too strong, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=889.96s)]
*  a pawn of the president. Because it would seem from what Maggie said that their plan is to drop [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=895.32s)]
*  the case, but say they could bring it back. That message would seem to be, we can make all your [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=905.24s)]
*  problems go away, Mr. Mayor, or we can make your problems come right back. You're right, Michael. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=909.96s)]
*  There is a sword of Damocles that is hanging over Eric Adams with every decision that he has to make. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=914.6s)]
*  Every decision about whether to let an ice raid proceed in his city. Every decision about whether [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=920.92s)]
*  or not he is going to oppose the president of the United States on a policy that might affect New [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=927.0s)]
*  York City residents. And with each one of those, he's going to have to say, is it worth it to stand [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=933.0799999999999s)]
*  up to this man if he can bring the Justice Department back on me on these cases at any [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=941.48s)]
*  given moment? That would end my career. That would end my career. It not only end his career, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=947.64s)]
*  but if you look at some of these charges, there's the possibility of jail time out here. So I have [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=952.52s)]
*  never seen a rower exercise of presidential power. He could have just given him a pardon, in which [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=958.6800000000001s)]
*  case Adams would be free to go do whatever he wants to go do. So now instead, he has simply, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=965.88s)]
*  or the Justice Department, we don't know if the president was directly involved, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=974.6s)]
*  has simply suspended the case. You're saying there's a real Machiavellian value in arranging [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=979.48s)]
*  the situation such that Adams simply cannot afford to not do the president's bidding. It [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=987.32s)]
*  certainly looks that way. In fact, that sort of underrates Machiavelli, I think, to some degree. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=994.68s)]
*  This goes beyond just the Eric Adams case, too. I think what this all is showing is Trump has an [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1003.0s)]
*  intent to, he doesn't want to limit his influence and power just to the executive branch, just to [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1010.1999999999999s)]
*  Washington. It is extraordinary to see a president say, I'm not just going to be limited by, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1015.16s)]
*  my power will not be limited by the checks and balance of the federal government. I will involve [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1022.8399999999999s)]
*  myself in cities, in the private sector, and the global stage. I will put that Trump stamp on really [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1026.68s)]
*  all matters of society and the country. And not only will I do that, but I am going to do it all [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1033.08s)]
*  out in the open. These are not backroom conversations. This is, we are doing this, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1037.72s)]
*  and this is how I'm going to go about it. And it doesn't really bother me if it bothers you, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1044.52s)]
*  because unless you can stop me, I'm going to do it. I want to turn to the president's actions [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1049.48s)]
*  this week overseas, because after focusing so heavily on his battle against the federal [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1053.72s)]
*  bureaucracy, he's now inserted himself quite forcefully into two of the world's biggest [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1060.04s)]
*  conflicts, the war in Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas. Let's start with Ukraine. David, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1064.92s)]
*  in just about the past 48 hours, it feels like Trump tossed out most of, if not all of America's [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1070.52s)]
*  existing approach to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which was to isolate Russia [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1077.56s)]
*  and to support Ukraine. Can you briefly tick through what the administration did and where it [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1084.6799999999998s)]
*  leaves the conflict? Well, let's start with what the old policy was. The old policy was the United [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1091.48s)]
*  States will do everything it can, short of sending troops to help support the Ukrainians against an [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1100.12s)]
*  invasion that they neither prompted nor saw. That was the Biden position. The second argument- [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1107.08s)]
*  We should explain that when you're in Europe, that's what the sirens sound like behind you. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1115.0s)]
*  I was going to ask you if you really wanted to hear these, but now you know I'm really immune. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1120.12s)]
*  No, you're not faking it. It's like a Mission Impossible. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1124.1999999999998s)]
*  Such a better siren song than what we have here. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1128.04s)]
*  So the old strategy also was whenever we are ready to go into a negotiation to end the war, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1131.0s)]
*  it will be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. That means that the Ukrainians will be at the [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1138.76s)]
*  center of the negotiation and no one's going to give away their country the way one did in colonial [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1145.08s)]
*  times. This is going to be the Ukrainians working it out with the Russians. Imperialism will not be [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1151.32s)]
*  rewarded. That's right. And imperialism will not be rewarded meant that Vladimir Putin couldn't [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1158.2s)]
*  come away from this with more land or a better situation than he had before. Vladimir Putin [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1164.3600000000001s)]
*  couldn't come away from this in a situation where he would be ready a few years from now to finish [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1171.24s)]
*  the job and take the rest of Ukraine. So fast forward to what happened. After dancing around [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1179.16s)]
*  each other for weeks, Putin and President Trump finally get on the phone for 90 minutes. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1186.04s)]
*  When it's all done, Trump comes out and says we're on the way to a peace deal. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1192.68s)]
*  There's going to be a negotiation missing from all of this, the Europeans and the Ukrainians. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1197.08s)]
*  And we're talking to you on Thursday midday, but earlier in the day here in Europe, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1204.44s)]
*  Zelensky came out and said, I'm not going along with any agreement about my country [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1213.56s)]
*  that I'm not involved in negotiating. So we are hours away from the start of the Munich Security [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1219.08s)]
*  Conference, which is the Taylor Swift concert of national security professionals, foreign ministers, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1226.2s)]
*  anybody interested in it, hard to get tickets. If you say so, David. Yeah, right. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1233.8s)]
*  It's this is this is truly the foreign policy nerds collection, but it's also the place [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1239.0s)]
*  where the Europeans all get together and traditionally have unified around Ukraine. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1246.68s)]
*  And suddenly, the central cog in all of this, the United States has decided to shift in the [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1254.04s)]
*  other direction. Say we're getting a deal, no matter what the deal is. Maggie, and so I want [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1260.44s)]
*  to understand why a president who wrote a book called The Art of the Deal, who sees himself as [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1266.04s)]
*  a master negotiator, would start a peace process that many people believe should start now between [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1270.76s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine by giving away so much leverage to Russia. On top of what David described, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1278.84s)]
*  the Trump administration in the past couple of days has said that Ukraine should not enter NATO, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1286.68s)]
*  the alliance that would protect it from future Russian invasion. It has said that Ukraine is [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1293.24s)]
*  never going to return to its pre-invasion borders. Between those two proclamations and Trump's [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1298.36s)]
*  call with Putin, it really does feel like he's starting a peace process almost entirely on [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1305.64s)]
*  Russia's terms. Why would he give away that much leverage to Russia? You answered your question [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1312.2s)]
*  because his interest is not in preserving what Ukraine wants. He is much more interested in [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1320.76s)]
*  forging a durable relationship between the US and Russia. He is very interested in his [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1325.4s)]
*  personal relationship with Putin. He is very obsessed with nuclear war and nuclear capabilities, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1330.68s)]
*  and this has been one of his obsessions about Russia for years. There was one piece of leverage [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1335.96s)]
*  he did not give away, and he was open about it, which is that he's going to continue providing [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1340.12s)]
*  aid to Ukraine because he does recognize that there is leverage there. Interesting. But he also [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1344.92s)]
*  put some conditions on it. It's not a total giveaway of all the chits, but he is making [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1349.4s)]
*  clear that he believes that this will arrive at a faster place and a place that he can live with. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1356.6000000000001s)]
*  He is a skeptic of Zelensky, and he is a skeptic of Ukraine, and he has been very clear about that [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1361.8000000000002s)]
*  for a long time. I'm coming to learn too that it's very difficult to put Trump into one of the [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1368.2s)]
*  traditional labels that we use. For foreign policy. For any policy. Isolationist, imperialist. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1373.56s)]
*  Covering this more and more, the word I just keep coming back to is transactional. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1381.08s)]
*  He has this view where each nation, allies are just taking advantage of the United States, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1387.0s)]
*  and what are we getting in return? Even in the case of Ukraine, we've been hearing more and more [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1394.28s)]
*  about yes, he did say he would commit to aid, but also he wants critical earth minerals as well. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1398.36s)]
*  Now, what can the US gain from this? When you have somebody where that's the through line, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1404.04s)]
*  just a transactional approach, with that comes unpredictability as well. You're no longer governed [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1411.08s)]
*  by a set of rules of acting a certain way with allies and another way with adversaries. It seems [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1416.6s)]
*  like it just has resulted in global leaders across the world, from Europe to the Middle East now, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1422.84s)]
*  walking on eggshells. What else it does is it takes you back to what Donald Trump has been saying [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1428.3600000000001s)]
*  was his favorite era, the McKinley era. In the 1890s, where we're taking lands, in that case, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1435.32s)]
*  the Philippines, Guam, and so forth. Now, what he wants is Greenland, the Panama Canal, and to own [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1441.8s)]
*  Gaza. But what that really tells you is that everything that we have done since World War II [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1452.52s)]
*  to build up alliances and basically establish that people should ally with the United States [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1459.64s)]
*  on a basis of principle, not on basis of American power, is out the window. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1465.0s)]
*  Maggie, that's one of my questions is, I know we're struggling to pin down a Trump ideology when it [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1471.4s)]
*  comes to foreign affairs. Zolan, you're describing it as transactional, but I wonder if we're [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1477.0s)]
*  underestimating the element of imperialism that David just hinted at, and if what's partly going [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1481.96s)]
*  on here is that Trump is giving Russia the deference that he wants the world to give him [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1488.6000000000001s)]
*  if he tries to, say, take Greenland or the Panama Canal or Gaza. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1494.28s)]
*  Maggie Scalise That's part of it, but he's doing that because he likes the way Vladimir Putin [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1499.72s)]
*  rules, which is with an iron fist. That is what he likes. That is what appeals to him. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1505.88s)]
*  So that is why he is giving that deference. I think Zolan is exactly right, and I would just [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1510.92s)]
*  add that this is where the leverage over whomever comes into play, and this is how our Eric Adams [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1515.5600000000002s)]
*  conversation relates to this. Trump is showing all of these foreign leaders that he will do these [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1521.3200000000002s)]
*  kinds of things at home to. He will do these kinds of things within the US. He will try to make his [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1527.4s)]
*  strength known locally, even though there is supposed to be some level of autonomy within [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1533.4s)]
*  states. But yes, I do think that there is growingly visible imperialism. I personally don't think [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1539.16s)]
*  Donald Trump is any different than he was in his first term. He just happens to actually understand [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1546.2s)]
*  more about where levers are, but this was hidden from view, this side of him, and his impulses were [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1551.24s)]
*  curbed by a number of advisors. It goes back to now it is just all hanging out there because he can. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1557.0s)]
*  Aaron Powell Maggie, I want to pick up on something you're saying about how this all relates to the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1563.16s)]
*  way his administration is treating something as local as the Adams case and how that has global [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1567.0s)]
*  implications. And I want to apply that to Gaza. The president has articulated this plan, which [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1573.4s)]
*  some don't see as literal, some do, to permanently remove all two million Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1580.12s)]
*  move them to neighboring Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan, and then have the US take over [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1585.96s)]
*  Gaza and lead its redevelopment into what Trump has called a city for the peoples of the world. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1591.88s)]
*  Many people read that to mean mostly Israelis. What ends up happening in the past couple of [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1596.6s)]
*  days, and I know a few of you covered this, is that the leader of Jordan, King Abdullah, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1602.28s)]
*  one of the countries that would have to accept Palestinians, comes to the White House, and Trump [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1606.36s)]
*  is trying to sell him on this plan. And it's very clear how uncomfortable the leader of Jordan is. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1610.52s)]
*  So I want you to apply that prism, Maggie, Zolan, David, that you just did of the way Trump uses [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1616.9199999999998s)]
*  power locally, how it applies to an international situation like this. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1624.28s)]
*  Well, and it was more than just selling him. And this, I think, will get to your question. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1629.32s)]
*  It was more than just selling him. He put the pressure on him when he was in the White House. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1633.3999999999999s)]
*  King Abdullah- With the cameras rolling. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1638.28s)]
*  With the cameras rolling. King Abdullah's sitting next to President Trump. President Trump is asked, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1639.3999999999999s)]
*  hey, look, you have this plan to forcibly remove Palestinians to these neighboring countries. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1645.24s)]
*  The king of one of those nations does not want to do that. And then Trump started to answer by [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1651.48s)]
*  saying, well, we just had a nice conversation, and then immediately turns and puts the king of Jordan [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1657.48s)]
*  on the spot. Why should the king take in the Palestinian people? He's made clear he doesn't [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1662.92s)]
*  want to. Well, I don't know, but he may have just something to say because we discussed just briefly. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1667.24s)]
*  I think maybe you want to say it now or- Well, Mr. President- [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1673.56s)]
*  Yeah, what did the king say back? Well, in that moment, he used what a lot of other leaders have [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1677.8s)]
*  used thus far with Trump. Flattery, placating. We have to keep in mind that there is a plan from [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1683.24s)]
*  Egypt and the Arab countries. He basically was saying to the president, trying to make the case [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1689.32s)]
*  that they are helping Palestinians in Gaza and that they should continue to talk about this with [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1694.52s)]
*  the Egyptians as well, another nation. But he didn't forcibly push back at that point when he [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1700.36s)]
*  was in front of President Trump. And it was only until hours later that the king of Jordan [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1706.04s)]
*  tweeted out saying, posted on social media basically saying, our stance remains the same. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1712.84s)]
*  We do not want Palestinians forcibly displaced. But that was when he was outside the White House, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1720.84s)]
*  away from the cameras, now away from Trump at that point. And yes, that message from the king of [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1727.6399999999999s)]
*  Jordan may go to his domestic audience. I think that President Trump also got the scene he wanted [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1733.24s)]
*  for his audience as well. 100%. The dynamics might be a little bit different, but the basic [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1739.96s)]
*  through line is the same with both the Eric Adams case and that meeting with King Abdul and what [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1745.8s)]
*  Trump is trying to extract from him, which is, I want something and you are reliant on me. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1749.88s)]
*  In Abdul's case, it is aid. In Eric Adams case, it is his freedom. Right, billions of dollars a [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1754.84s)]
*  year that the US gives to Jordan. That's right. He is going to apply pressure and he's going to do it [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1760.28s)]
*  pretty plainly. Michael, this is another through line. Think of the Ukrainians and think of the [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1767.6399999999999s)]
*  Palestinians. Right. So in both cases, they're to in Trump's mind, not major players here. They are [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1772.28s)]
*  pawns to be moved around. Trump has never in since he's raised this idea, gone and tackled the [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1781.72s)]
*  question that the Geneva Convention actually forbids the mass movement of ethnic groups. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1789.08s)]
*  He views international treaties, international law as obstacles to his plan and the way he's [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1796.4399999999998s)]
*  going to get past it, he believes, is by pressuring allies over whom he's got some leverage and that [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1803.1599999999999s)]
*  would be in this case, Jordan and Egypt. Right. What you're really getting at here is that when [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1809.32s)]
*  it comes to the domestic and the international front, this version of the Trump presidency, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1814.28s)]
*  this undiluted, unrestrained, Maggie to use your words, version of it is one where the victors [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1820.2s)]
*  win totally. Right. And in the case of Russia, Ukraine, Russia will win almost totally. In the [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1828.76s)]
*  case of Israel versus Hamas when it comes to Gaza, Israel will pretty much win totally. And in his [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1835.0s)]
*  interactions with the bureaucracy or Eric Adams, it will be Trump who will win totally. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1841.16s)]
*  You are hitting on a very important dynamic with Trump. Everything is zero sum. Everything is zero [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1847.16s)]
*  sum. And there are clear winners. There are clear losers. And so everything with Trump is a maximalist [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1853.96s)]
*  position. And then he sees how, you know, if he has to even walk things back in a different direction. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1860.52s)]
*  As I was getting off the plane here from Munich, I ran into a European diplomat I'd known for a long [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1866.76s)]
*  time. And we were discussing this dynamic, what we've seen in Ukraine, what we've seen in Gaza. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1873.24s)]
*  And he said, you know, it goes back to Thucydides, right? Who wrote the history of the Peloponnesian [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1879.32s)]
*  War and that famous boat we all had to learn in 11th grade, which is the powerful do whatever they [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1884.92s)]
*  can and the weak do whatever they must. I'm sure I've got the phrasing slightly wrong there. But [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1892.2s)]
*  that's the world that Donald Trump sees at home and abroad. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1898.68s)]
*  Well, on that unexpected, incredibly erudite literary note, David, thank you. Zolan, thank you. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1903.88s)]
*  Maggie, thank you. And again, happy Valentine's Day. Thank you, Michael. And honored to be here [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1912.92s)]
*  with you for it. Happy Valentine's Day, Michael. Great to be with you. Thank you. All three. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1918.44s)]
*  On Thursday afternoon, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan resigned rather than obey the order [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1924.2s)]
*  from Trump's Justice Department to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1930.76s)]
*  Eric Adams. In a letter, the U.S. attorney said she could no longer remain in the job because, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1935.8s)]
*  the law does not support a dismissal, and because I am confident that Adams has committed the crimes [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1943.8799999999999s)]
*  with which he is charged. Soon after, the Justice Department sought to reassign the case [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1951.24s)]
*  to a different team of lawyers in Washington. But the two attorneys who run that team, as well as [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1957.8799999999999s)]
*  three of their colleagues, also resigned rather than follow the order. The six resignations were [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1964.9199999999998s)]
*  a remarkable rebuke of the administration's decision to end the case against Mayor Adams. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnntVANdrs&t=1972.6s)]
