# 'The Interview': Ayana Elizabeth Johnson Has an Antidote to Our Climate Delusions
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kiml4AwAX4E)
*  Hey, everybody. It's Sabrina. Just popping in here to remind you that every weekend on
*  Saturday, we're going to be sending you episodes of a new show our colleagues are making. The
*  show is called The Interview. This week on the show, David Marchese talks with scientist
*  Ayanna Elizabeth Johnson. Okay, here's the show.
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm David Marchese.
*  Back in 2018, a big climate report came out that really shook me. It painted a pretty
*  dire picture of where we're heading, a climate that will likely warm by at least one and
*  a half degrees Celsius by 2040. And it was a grim warning of what things will look like
*  if we don't reverse course. It now seems probable that we're going to blow past those
*  climate targets. And that's led to a lot of climate fear, pessimism, and activism rooted
*  in anger. But recently, there's been a growing counter response to those darker feelings,
*  including from some experts who have a clear view on what's coming. And that response
*  is a cautious optimism. Though she doesn't go so far as to call herself hopeful, Dr.
*  Ayanna Elizabeth Johnson is one of those experts trying to change the mood on climate. She's
*  a marine biologist, the co-founder of a think tank focused on the future of coastal cities,
*  and she's also worked on climate policy, advising lawmakers and working with the EPA on climate
*  solutions. And she's got a new book that's due out this summer called What If We Get
*  It Right? Visions of Climate Futures. That question, what if we get it right on climate,
*  is one I think about a lot. I'm skeptical, but I wish I weren't. That's why I spoke
*  with Johnson, to see if she can help me think and feel differently. Here's our conversation.
*  So I feel like over the last decade or so, the framing and discussion about the climate
*  crisis, a lot of it has been rooted in feelings of fear, and anger, and despair. And I think,
*  more recently, there's been sort of a concerted effort to make a kind of a vibe shift about how
*  we talk about climate. Climate action needs way better vibes. It needs better vibes. Why do you
*  think there has been a shift towards talking about and thinking about solutions from a place of like
*  positive possibility? We've had, at this point, it's been multiple decades of, it's happening,
*  it's coming, it's here, it's bad. Oh, it's really bad. Okay, we should do something. And,
*  of course, all that is factually accurate. But the question is, how do we convey that in a way
*  that brings people in? And projecting endless images of various apocalyptic scenarios is not
*  super motivating, right? It kind of, we went from like, okay, climate change, is this really
*  happening? To like, how serious is this? To, oh, God, it's so bad, let's just give up. And sort
*  of skipped this middle step of all hands on deck. Is it your sense, or do you know if there's data
*  that's been collected that, like, there are people who want to be involved in climate, but are being
*  sort of rendered paralyzed by fear or despair, or that there are disinterested people who, you
*  know, are just waiting to be motivated by kind of a softer approach? Well, first of all, I don't
*  think there's any one way that we should be communicating about climate. Some people are
*  very motivated by the bad news. They're like, oh, shit, got to avoid that. Like, whoa, that's
*  terrifying. Like, what can I do to prevent the worst case scenario? Some people need that jolt.
*  And that's what gets them going. Some people are overwhelmed by that, and just don't know where to
*  start. I think there's this false dichotomy between hope and fear, as if there's one is the right way
*  to communicate. When in fact, there's like a full spectrum of emotions that can be triggered by
*  various things that you receive about the world around you, about news about climate change. And
*  all of that is useful. And so 62% of adults in the US say they feel a personal sense of responsibility
*  to help reduce global warming. But 51% say they don't know where to start. And so to me, the
*  question is, how do we harness and support millions of people in this country alone, who would like
*  to be a part of the solutions? That's what we need is to live in a world where people are really
*  focused on ensuring a livable future on this planet. That we have moved beyond sort of the
*  platitudes of reduce, reuse, recycle. People don't even really pay attention to the first R there,
*  the reduce people kind of ignore. But how can we really create a culture where everyone has a role
*  to play? And we have a choice of like, what are we going to do when faced with this problem? Are we
*  going to put our heads in the sand? Or are we going to pitch in?
*  You know, when you said the first R in reduce, reuse, recycle is one that a lot of people ignore,
*  you know, it makes me think about an idea that I think is a difficult one for, for lack of a better
*  term, the average person in the global north, it's difficult for them to think about. And that's the
*  idea of sacrifice or sacrificing things that they take for granted or comforts.
*  Or just less is more is maybe a nicer way to...
*  People don't like sacrifice. People don't like bans. But I think there's a way to frame that as
*  like, this is an opportunity to just like live a different and better life.
*  So make the case for me that it's better. Like, do you think there is a possible climate future that
*  doesn't involve personal sacrifice?
*  I mean, I don't think consumerism is really that satisfying for most people. We're sort of taught
*  that we need to keep up with these trends and like buy all this stuff. But it doesn't really make us
*  happy. Happiness levels are declining, people have fewer close friends, like it's not like the
*  current status quo is awesome, and we should be fighting to hold on to it, right? We just like,
*  have a bunch of junk. Instead of being surrounded by beautiful, durable, repairable things that we
*  love, we've just like got a bunch of single use plastic garbage. And just having like, piles of
*  garbage everywhere is not like super delightful, right? Like having all this fossil fuel based
*  plastic on every beach and in our drinking water and in our rain and in our beer and in our seafood
*  which is currently the case. It's not like that's a life I want to hold on to. And so, so often we
*  think about the changes that are needed. We don't actually look at both sides of the coin. We think
*  about, oh, this is going to be expensive, or oh, this is going to be inconvenient. Without thinking
*  about like, do you know how inconvenient and expensive climate changes? It is so much worse.
*  If you actually balance the cost of addressing the climate crisis, starting now, with the cost of
*  not addressing it. I mean, those are wildly different orders of magnitude of inconvenience
*  and dollars.
*  You know, just because you mentioned seafood, do you find that people get anxious ordering seafood
*  when you go out for dinner with them? Are you silently judging them?
*  I kind of wish they'd get more anxious. No, I'm judging them out loud.
*  What do you say?
*  Well, I will not let anyone eat octopus in front of me. That is a hard line. I mean, they're so smart.
*  They're so cool. Like, why would you eat them? I sometimes say to people like, do you want to go
*  have sushi? I'm like, do you really want to have sushi with me?
*  And is it stupid for anybody to be buying a beach home these days?
*  I mean, if you like to set money on fire, it's a great plan. I don't know. I mean, the level of
*  denial of the changes that are coming is really off the charts. And the way people joke about it,
*  like go to the Hamptons to a cocktail party and tell someone that you work on climate change,
*  and they'll be like, so how soon till I have beachfront property? Because I'm like a few rows
*  back right now. Just like as if it's funny, and we don't actually have to prepare for things.
*  But I get it. It's really hard to get your head around the amount of change that's coming.
*  Does other people, what you see as other people's denial make you angry?
*  Anger is not really a primary emotion for me. I mean, I'm just a regular human. I experience
*  a full range of emotions. Certainly anger is one of them, but heartache is another. I mean,
*  if we think about just how much we're losing, that can be really hard.
*  Yeah, that can be really hard to deal with. And as a scientist, I mean, I look at all these
*  projections and I could cry looking at a graph, because I know the amount of suffering and
*  ecological loss that these numbers imply. But honestly, I feel quite lucky to have been born
*  with a brain chemistry that's not prone to depression, because given the amount of bad
*  news I take in every day, that would be really hard to deal with.
*  But there is kind of this soft denial of the climate crisis that I think is extremely
*  widespread, including for someone like myself. Oh, describe your soft climate denial.
*  Well, I feel like I understand the scope and honestly, the horrifying scale of our climate
*  future. And if that's true, why don't I do more than compost? I don't know why.
*  Well, it's, you know, I'm supposed to be asking you these questions.
*  This is going to be much more informative for the audience, actually, hearing what you
*  want to say, because we're all in that same boat. Like if this is true.
*  Yes. And this goes directly to the heart of one of my first questions for you. It's like,
*  what motivates behavior? And I feel like, you know, for me, what small steps I've taken in
*  response to the climate crisis have been directly the result of feelings of anger and despair,
*  both my own. Anger can be very motivating.
*  Both my own and, you know, over the last 10 years, there's been more anger and fury about
*  what's happening than ever before. And that is directly coterminous with the biggest changes
*  we've seen in terms of pro-climate policy, in terms of sort of public awareness of the problem,
*  politicians actually acknowledging that this is a problem. All of this, to me, suggests that
*  anger works. And then there's also, you know, and fear too, like they didn't get people to
*  stop smoking by saying, think about how healthy you'll be if you don't do it. They got people
*  to stop smoking by saying, this will really hurt you if you continue to do it. And my inclination
*  is to think that the same logic applies in climate. And this is all sort of just tangential to the
*  question you just asked me, which is why don't I do more? And, you know, I think I honestly find
*  it too big and too heartbreaking. And also I'm basically comfortable. You know, I'm basically
*  comfortable. I think a lot of us are dealing with this cognitive dissonance, right, between the
*  lifestyles that we have, especially those of us who have nice lifestyles, and the knowledge that
*  it's probably unsustainable. And I think there are all these structural things that are in the way
*  of us shifting our lifestyles. You cannot take a train instead of a plane if that train doesn't
*  exist. I feel like there is obviously an enormous amount we can do as individuals, but really the
*  system around us is not set up for success. I mean, this is why I focus on policy and not shaming
*  individual people into like tiny actions in their own lives, although we really do need to, they do
*  add up. Like we should all do more and better. But I think this is the need and the opportunity.
*  This is why it's so important to have things like the almost $400 billion in the Inflation Reduction
*  Act that help to seed this transformation. Like how can people afford to electrify their homes?
*  We have millions of buildings in this country that need to be retrofit. We need to take out all these
*  boilers. We need to change our HVAC systems. We need to put in heat pumps, induction stoves,
*  electric water heaters, solar panels, green roofs, right? Like there are these like big-
*  And the grid has to be transformed to accommodate-
*  The grid has to be transformed. These are not things individuals have control over. It's not
*  that simple list of vote, donate, spread the word, protest, lower your carbon footprint.
*  That's not enough. And the fact that I know you went out of your way to make sure to interview a
*  climate person in the first few episodes of this show, that's something only you can do, right?
*  Maybe I just have like an unexamined rage problem or anger issue, but it makes me
*  mad to hear- If you want to be mad, there are actual
*  fossil fuel and big ag and advertising executives and politicians who are enabling all of this.
*  There are individual humans, actually a quite small group of them, who are making these decisions
*  that are impacting life on this planet for the 8 million or so species that share it. And that
*  should make you mad because who are they to decide the future of life on earth and to be
*  so callous and so short-term thinking and so quarterly earnings, profit, shareholder,
*  dividend driven, that they are jeopardizing biodiversity and quality of life for all of us?
*  But do you have, like, are there historical models where massive social change was rooted in
*  feelings of joy and positivity and not, you know, indignation, moral outrage, conflict?
*  I don't think there's any movement that's just based on one emotion. The ways we're experiencing
*  the horrors of environmental destruction are motivating people to get in the streets,
*  but it's also like we love nature. We love clean rivers. We love all of these things,
*  like the caesaurus of aspen leaves. Why would you not want to keep that around? And it's just a
*  matter of like, what do you do with those feelings? Can you remind me what caesaurus means?
*  There's so many good nature words. It is the sound of leaves in the wind.
*  Tell me other good nature words.
*  Heterocore is the smell of the soil after it first starts to rain.
*  Oh, that is a good one.
*  I mean, then there's like the Latin names of Caribbean fish species like Lactophis tricolor.
*  There's so many good ones.
*  What's the non-Latin name of that fish species?
*  That's a smooth trunk fish.
*  That's also a great name.
*  Also a good name. Yeah, they're hilarious.
*  But I feel like I'm being like a David Downer here, but just to respond to the idea of sacrifice.
*  I just saw a study that if we follow the most plausible possible path to decarbonization
*  by 2050, if we get there, the amount of carbon emissions that are already in the air will result
*  in something like $38 trillion worth of damages every year. That's baked in.
*  What are we talking about really when we're talking about possibilities?
*  What is it that you don't want to give up?
*  The thing I don't want to give up is I don't want to give up the range of possibilities
*  for my kids. They're seven and nine. These are totally selfish things to bring up.
*  I assume you care about other people on the planet besides your children.
*  My wife. You seem nice. I hope things work out for you.
*  Thank you so much. I appreciate that.
*  I just don't know how to think about the future. I'm talking with you today and really the
*  fundamental thing is I'm trying to understand how to think about the future. I don't feel like I
*  understand it. What you mentioned about wanting to secure a good future for your children,
*  this is the number one thing that drives people to do something about climate change.
*  It really does come down to love as an enormously powerful motivator.
*  I don't have children, but if I did, I would want to be able to look them in the eye and say,
*  I did everything I could to secure your future. And I think most parents feel that way.
*  I feel that way about my godchildren, for sure. I feel that way about children that I
*  barely know at all. And so I feel like whether it's fear, anger, or love, anxiety,
*  all of those can lead to us further rolling up our sleeves. That's the inflection that needs to
*  happen for everybody. I mean, I guess perhaps it's worth saying it's okay not to be hopeful.
*  I feel like there's so much emphasis in our society on being hopeful, as if that's the
*  answer to unlocking everything. I'm not a hopeful person. I'm not an optimist.
*  I see the data. I see what's coming. But I also see the full range of possible futures.
*  I feel like there's so much that we could create. It's not gonna be perfect. But yeah,
*  how can we each be a part of getting it as right as possible?
*  I think what getting it right could look like would be a good thing for us to pick back up on
*  when we speak again next week. Yeah, I love that.
*  After the break, my second call with Dr. Johnson. I ask her more about specific solutions to the
*  climate crisis and what she thinks might stop us from pursuing them. I think I don't engage as
*  deeply as I should with the political divisions in America and around the world as being a really,
*  really enormous barrier to getting any of this done.
*  Hello. Hey, Iona. How are you? I'm good. This is the interview. I'm David Marchese.
*  You know, one of the things that you had said near the end of our first conversation was the
*  phrase that's the title of your book, What if we get it right? Can you give specific examples
*  of what getting it right on climate looks like? What are things that are within our grasp
*  that we can get right? So many things. I mean, we know how to transition to renewable energy.
*  We know how to insulate buildings. We know how to put on green roofs or reflective roofs on
*  buildings. We know how to improve public transit. We know how to shift our transportation towards
*  electric. We know how to avoid food waste, which is actually a huge source of greenhouse gas
*  emissions as food is rotting and releasing methane. We know how to just reduce our consumption.
*  There's a million things we could do. Of course, there's room for innovation, but
*  there's absolutely nothing that we need to wait for.
*  So I'm always very impressed when people have what feels like very reasonable,
*  plausible answers to these big questions about life on earth. But if you're tossing and turning
*  in your bed at night, what skepticism do you have about your own ideas? What might you be wrong about?
*  I think I don't engage as deeply as I should with the political divisions in America and around the
*  world as being a really, really enormous barrier to getting any of this done. I'm not in the dark
*  about it, but it's not something that infuses my daily life and work. And every time it hits me,
*  I'm just like, how can we get past this? Like the question of this upcoming election,
*  the stakes are so high and we have so many people who do not appreciate
*  the risks that we're facing and so are not motivated to do much to address them.
*  So unfortunately, the climate crisis is going to give us a lot of tests for how we can collaborate
*  across various social divisions. But a lot of the solutions to climate change people agree on,
*  even if they don't agree on the problem, people are very excited about the new
*  battery manufacturing plants in like deeply red parts of this country because they're good for
*  this country because they're good jobs. Texas and Iowa have the most wind energy of any place in
*  the US because it's profitable. So the economics of the transition to renewable energy and
*  implementing climate solutions make a lot of sense. And so we may have to just skip over
*  some of these divisions and let self-interest in various ways guide us towards where we need to go,
*  even if we don't all agree on exactly the contours of the problem.
*  You know, I gotta say that there was a response that I gave to you based on a question that you
*  asked me in our prior conversation that I've really been thinking about since we spoke. And
*  I was talking about the context of the future and sacrifice or if we might have to sacrifice.
*  And you had asked me what I was so afraid of giving up. And I was really thinking about that
*  since we spoke. And I concluded that I think the answer that I gave you in the moment was kind of
*  cockamamie. So I want to try and give you what I think is a more truthful answer. And the real
*  answer to why I might be reluctant to change behaviors or be scared of the future in some ways
*  is maybe actually has more to do with some selfishness.
*  That's good of you to admit. I think we all want to hold on to our comforts.
*  Well, is there sort of an antidote to that kind of thinking? And then also,
*  is it possible that just is human nature?
*  I think the answer is community. We have to be responsible to more than ourselves. We have to
*  feel an obligation to more than just our children. It can't just be a selfish desire to hold on to
*  what we currently have, which is even that illogical because the world is going to change around us and
*  the things that we have, we won't be able to hold on to because we can't actually control
*  all of society and live in a bubble. And so you can maybe rip really tightly onto your comforts
*  in the short term. But the more we resist being part of the collective solution,
*  the less likely that collective solution is to happen. I mean, in a sense, you're echoing a bit
*  of this bunker mentality, right? Where we have these wealthy people who are buying up land in New
*  Zealand and wherever else, trying to just save themselves. And to me, that seems like such a sad
*  way to see the world, right? Like, do you want to live in a bunker for a year eating canned rations?
*  Like, is that the life we want to build? Or do we just all try to make sure we have a world
*  where there's enough for everybody? Where no one takes too much and we share what we have?
*  I'd rather share.
*  That's Ayanna Elizabeth Johnson. This conversation was produced by Seth Kelly. It was edited by
*  Annabel Bacon, mixing by Afim Shapiro. Original music by Dan Powell, Elisheba Etup, and Marion
*  Lozano. Photography by Philip Montgomery. The rest of the team is Priya Matthew and Wyatt Orm.

*  speaks with Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos. I don't agree with the premise that quantity and quality
*  are somehow in conflict with each other. I think our content and our movie programming
*  has been great, but it's just not all for you. I'm David Marchese, and this is The Interview
*  from The New York Times.
