# Trump Shocks Europe
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=4.24s)]
*  A few days ago, the Trump administration began blowing up America's existing approach to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=11.64s)]
*  ending the war between Russia and Ukraine by embracing Russia and snubbing Ukraine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  And that shift has quickly turned into a broader assault on America's relationship with Europe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=23.44s)]
*  Today, Moscow bureau chief Anton Tronofsky, on how it's all adding up to a stunning victory [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=29.76s)]
*  for Vladimir Putin and a major setback for the once ironclad alliance between the US [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  and Europe. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  It's Monday, February 17th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  So Anton, during the presidential campaign, Donald Trump vowed to end the war in Ukraine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=55.88s)]
*  And this past week, he has turned his attention to that conflict, but in a way that has been [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  really scrambling the picture, not just for Ukraine, not just for Russia, but really for [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=66.22s)]
*  all of Europe. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  So tell us what that has looked like from your perspective. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=73.66s)]
*  I mean, it's been a really extraordinary week when it comes to the Ukraine war, the transatlantic [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  relationship and us kind of all discovering what Trump's second term in office is really [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  going to mean in terms of foreign policy, because it already feels so different from [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=90.44s)]
*  his first term. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  The first hint that something was going to change came early last week when surprisingly, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=96.76s)]
*  the Russians released Mark Fogel, an American school teacher who had been in jail in Russia. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  To get him out, Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, actually flew to Moscow and then [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=109.4s)]
*  later brought him home on his plane. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=117.36s)]
*  That was the first time that a senior American official had traveled to Russia since before [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=119.72s)]
*  the war. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=126.76s)]
*  So that was the first thing that happened. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=127.92s)]
*  Then on Wednesday, Trump speaks to Putin on the phone. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=130.36s)]
*  It was a 90 minute call, according to the Russians. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=136.04s)]
*  And just the mere fact of this call was really remarkable. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  It was the first time that we know of that an American president spoke to the Russian [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=142.18s)]
*  leader since Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=148.28s)]
*  Right, because Biden's strategy was to isolate Putin both diplomatically and economically [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=152.44s)]
*  to put pressure on him. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=158.84s)]
*  It was about sanctions. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=159.84s)]
*  It was about don't talk to Putin. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=161.64s)]
*  Show Russia that the fact that it launched Europe's biggest war of aggression since World [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=164.44s)]
*  War II was absolutely unacceptable and made Moscow a capital that was just not to be dealt [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=170.56s)]
*  with diplomatically. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=178.56s)]
*  And in addition, it was all about showing a united Western front. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=179.56s)]
*  The US under President Biden was very, very careful to coordinate all of its steps with [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=185.16s)]
*  Europeans just to show Putin that he wasn't going to be able to divide and conquer when [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=192.0s)]
*  dealing with the West. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  And Trump's call, which was clearly not pre coordinated with America's allies, broke that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=198.48s)]
*  precedent as well. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=205.42s)]
*  So tell me more about this call. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  What did they talk about? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  So I think you really have to read Trump's social media post about this call to really [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=210.64s)]
*  see how remarkable it was. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  Trump wrote that in this call, he and Putin both reflected on the great history of our [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=220.67999999999998s)]
*  nations and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=227.16s)]
*  And then Trump added that he and Putin had both agreed that they want to stop the war [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  in Ukraine and that President Putin even used Trump's quote, very strong campaign motto [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=238.56s)]
*  of common sense. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  Trump writes on social media after that call that he will then call President Volodymyr [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=248.12s)]
*  Zelensky, the Ukrainian leader, to inform him of that conversation with Putin. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=254.36s)]
*  So first he calls Putin and then he calls Zelensky to let him know how it went and what [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=260.76s)]
*  they discussed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=266.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=267.52s)]
*  So the message here from Trump is really, I'm going to sit down at the negotiating table. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=268.52s)]
*  I'm going to make the decisions and then I will inform you, Ukraine, of what I've decided. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=272.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=277.72s)]
*  Which was yet another major departure from the Biden administration's approach. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=278.72s)]
*  The Biden administration's philosophy that they repeated over and over was nothing about [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=283.92s)]
*  Ukraine without Ukraine. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  And here Trump threw that completely out the window. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=292.8s)]
*  And what did Zelensky have to say about all this? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=296.68s)]
*  So he later said that he, in his call with Trump that same day on Wednesday, he told [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=299.64s)]
*  Trump that Putin was a liar, someone you couldn't trust, someone who did not actually want peace [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=307.84s)]
*  and someone who could deploy Russian troops beyond Ukraine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=313.52s)]
*  At the same time, Zelensky was saying publicly that a strong America, a strong Trump, could [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=319.08s)]
*  Putin to make the kind of peace deal that Ukraine believes would be sustainable. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=328.16s)]
*  So he really tried to kind of put a positive spin on it, but I think it was pretty clear [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=335.04s)]
*  that just the speed with which Trump appeared to embrace making a deal with Putin to end [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=339.76000000000005s)]
*  the war really caught everyone off guard, including Ukraine. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=347.48s)]
*  That same day, Pete Hegseth, the new US defense secretary, gave a speech in Brussels. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=352.58000000000004s)]
*  And what did Hegseth say in that speech? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, good afternoon, friends. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=361.18s)]
*  This is my first Ukraine defense contact group and I'm honored to join all of you today. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=364.42s)]
*  This was really Hegseth's debut in Europe as the head of the Pentagon. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  And he was speaking to NATO and European defense ministers in Brussels. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=376.5s)]
*  We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=381.34s)]
*  But we must start by recognizing that a return to Ukraine's borders from before Putin annexed [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=387.14s)]
*  Crimea in 2014 was, quote, an unrealistic objective. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=394.34s)]
*  A durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=399.73999999999995s)]
*  will not begin again. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=405.26s)]
*  That said, the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=408.66s)]
*  outcome of a negotiated settlement. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=416.98s)]
*  He also said it was unrealistic that Ukraine would join NATO. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=419.74s)]
*  And he said that there will not be US troops deployed to Ukraine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=425.5s)]
*  If there were to be a peace deal, American troops would not be part of any peacekeeping [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=430.82000000000005s)]
*  mission to make sure Russia didn't invade again. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  President Trump looks forward to working together to continuing this frank discussion amongst [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=443.12s)]
*  friends and to achieve peace through strength together. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=448.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=453.96s)]
*  So to step back for a second, all those things that Hegseth said were, you know, something [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=455.24s)]
*  that many people assumed behind closed doors. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=462.0s)]
*  It was just stunning to hear Hegseth make those concessions publicly before any kind [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=466.16s)]
*  of negotiation with Putin actually took place. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=475.12s)]
*  Already giving away the store. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=478.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=480.2s)]
*  Before you even got to talks. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=481.2s)]
*  And so those concessions that Hegseth made, that put Europe into an incredibly tough spot [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=482.96s)]
*  because how do you guarantee Ukraine's security and deter a renewed Russian invasion at some [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=492.2s)]
*  point down the road if the US isn't involved? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=501.4s)]
*  You know, Russia's military is huge compared to any European country. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=505.28s)]
*  And obviously their nuclear arsenal is far greater than anything that Europe has. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=510.68s)]
*  So that speech really put into stark relief how much of a problem Europe was going to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=516.36s)]
*  have in finding a way to face down Russia and Putin without the US at its back. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=524.6s)]
*  How was all of this received, this call between Trump and Putin and the Hegseth speech? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=531.4s)]
*  Well I think it's fair to say that in Moscow there was quite a bit of elation in response. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=537.32s)]
*  The Russian stock market was up more than 5%. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=543.36s)]
*  The ruble, the Russian currency strengthened. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=546.0s)]
*  You had all these pro-Putin politicians posting on social media about how this was such a [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=549.04s)]
*  big win for Russia and it showed Putin's status as a brilliant foreign policy strategist. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=555.48s)]
*  In Europe there was both shock and confusion. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=562.18s)]
*  Pete Hegseth tried to walk back parts of his speech the next day. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=565.96s)]
*  Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in the talks. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=570.96s)]
*  On top of just the shock, you also just had people not really understanding what exactly [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=576.28s)]
*  the approach of the administration was going to be to Europe, to NATO, and to Russia and [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=583.16s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=590.6s)]
*  And all of this was happening just before the Munich Security Conference, this big annual [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=591.96s)]
*  gathering of security officials started on Friday in Germany. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  And JD Vance, the vice president, was scheduled to give a big speech. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=603.64s)]
*  So there was a lot of hope or at least expectation among Europeans that Vance, when he stepped [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=608.04s)]
*  up to that podium, was going to clarify where exactly the administration stood on these issues. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=614.22s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=634.64s)]
*  So Anton, you've just painted a picture for us of how America's allies are feeling really [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=642.64s)]
*  confused and concerned in this moment and that there was some hope that the vice president [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=648.24s)]
*  would offer some clarity about Ukraine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=653.96s)]
*  Did that happen? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=657.8s)]
*  Anton Lashkovitz It did not happen. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=658.8s)]
*  And the fact that it didn't was really yet another stunning moment of last week. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=663.0s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=669.0s)]
*  And thanks to all the gathered delegates and luminaries and media professionals. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=671.5200000000001s)]
*  So Vance gives this speech at the Munich Security Conference. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=676.6800000000001s)]
*  It's like this massive event, probably the most high profile security forum globally [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=681.12s)]
*  where you have tons of heads of state, prime ministers, defense ministers, foreign ministers [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=688.4s)]
*  in the audience. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=695.48s)]
*  We're happy to be here. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=696.48s)]
*  And one of the things that I wanted to talk about today is, of course, our shared values. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=698.44s)]
*  But instead of talking about Trump's foreign policy, he launches into this extensive criticism [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=706.08s)]
*  of Europe. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=715.5600000000001s)]
*  The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=716.76s)]
*  not any other external actor. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=723.04s)]
*  And what I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=725.76s)]
*  its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=732.4s)]
*  You know, a Europe that, in his telling, has departed from its democratic roots. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=737.28s)]
*  It's actually a picture of Europe that very much echoes what we've been hearing from [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=742.4s)]
*  Vladimir Putin over the last few years. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, he's long been criticizing Europe for becoming too woke, for silencing speech. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=760.92s)]
*  And I really do believe that allowing our citizens to speak their mind will make them [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=769.64s)]
*  stronger still. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=774.16s)]
*  Which of course brings us back to Munich, where the organizers of this very conference [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=776.4399999999999s)]
*  have banned lawmakers representing populist parties on both the left and the right from [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=782.16s)]
*  participating in these conversations. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=786.36s)]
*  Now again, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=788.96s)]
*  And you know, and even more remarkable was the fact that he was doing this in Germany [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=789.96s)]
*  the big national German election less than two weeks away, and where the German far-right [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=794.84s)]
*  party is hoping to make big gains. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=801.1600000000001s)]
*  And of course, the German far-right party, the Alternative for Germany has been very [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  much ostracized across the political spectrum in Germany for its links to neo-Nazi ideology [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=809.08s)]
*  and its attempts to whitewash the Nazi past. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=818.62s)]
*  If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=823.56s)]
*  Basically, the vice president of the United States is saying to his European allies, long-standing [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=829.28s)]
*  European allies, that Russia isn't the problem here, you are. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=834.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=838.7199999999999s)]
*  And Vance here is signaling the possibility that America will no longer be that key ally [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  of Western Europe and the European Union that it was for all those decades after the end [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=848.8s)]
*  of World War II. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=855.7199999999999s)]
*  We shouldn't be afraid of our people even when they express views that disagree with [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=857.36s)]
*  their leadership. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=862.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=864.06s)]
*  Good luck to all of you. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=865.06s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=866.06s)]
*  And on top of that, we also learned during the Munich Security Conference last weekend [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=868.92s)]
*  that the Trump administration does not expect Europe to be at the table when peace talks [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  around Ukraine finally take place. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=881.84s)]
*  We heard from Keith Kellogg, Trump's envoy to Ukraine, say that the Trump administration [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=885.96s)]
*  expects Russia and Ukraine to be at the table. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=891.8000000000001s)]
*  They expect the United States to act as a mediator, but that the Europeans probably won't be there. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=894.72s)]
*  And it's worth pointing out that it would be pretty striking for Europe to be excluded [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=903.26s)]
*  like this. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=907.3s)]
*  You know, European countries have contributed more than $100 billion, by some counts more [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=908.3s)]
*  than the US has in total, to Ukraine over the last three years. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=914.66s)]
*  So they clearly have a huge stake in this too. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=920.34s)]
*  Okay, basically it sounds like Europe's out, but Ukraine is in. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=923.86s)]
*  Well, maybe. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=928.66s)]
*  I mean, there's so much uncertainty right now. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=929.66s)]
*  In fact, we're actually continuing to see signs that Ukraine's involvement is in question. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=933.02s)]
*  Just this weekend, we learned that three top US officials, Marco Rubio, the Secretary of [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=940.02s)]
*  State, Mike Walz, the National Security Adviser, Steve Witkoff, the Middle East envoy, are [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=945.66s)]
*  all going to be in Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian officials about the war in Ukraine. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=951.3s)]
*  And for all we know, Ukraine won't be there. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=957.28s)]
*  So in that sense, it's not a surprise that when Volodymyr Zelensky was on Meet the Press [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=960.94s)]
*  on Sunday morning, he was insisting that Ukraine did need to be involved. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=968.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, but just ask a really basic question. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=973.74s)]
*  How do you end a war in Ukraine without Ukraine at the table? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=977.0200000000001s)]
*  Well, that's a great question. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=982.1400000000001s)]
*  It is true, Rachel, that the US is Ukraine's biggest ally. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=986.18s)]
*  And Zelensky himself has said that if the US were to pull its aid, it would be very [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=989.5s)]
*  difficult for Ukraine to survive as an independent country. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=994.8599999999999s)]
*  On the flip side, Putin has also made it very clear that he wants to be talking to the US. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=998.8599999999999s)]
*  He sees Zelensky's government as a puppet of Washington. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1004.66s)]
*  So there is clearly space here for conversations between the US and Russia to happen. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1010.46s)]
*  It would just be pretty shocking for those conversations to happen without Ukraine being [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1018.0600000000001s)]
*  a part of them. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1023.14s)]
*  But the second issue is that even if Russia and the US were to make a deal here, you would [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1024.96s)]
*  still need Ukraine to agree to it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1032.54s)]
*  You would need Ukraine to agree to stop fighting. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1035.14s)]
*  Zelensky has said very clearly that Ukraine will not accept a deal that they were not [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1038.54s)]
*  a part of in negotiating. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1044.22s)]
*  So the big question, if these negotiations get more serious, is going to be how do you [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1047.1799999999998s)]
*  thread the needle between Putin's demands and what Ukraine would need? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1053.3s)]
*  Putin is demanding not just to keep the territory he already has, but he also wants influence [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1060.1799999999998s)]
*  over Ukraine. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1065.78s)]
*  He wants Ukraine's military to be limited. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1066.78s)]
*  And then on the other hand, Zelensky and the Ukrainians are saying they need security guarantees. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1071.18s)]
*  They need assurances that there will be a response if Putin were to try to invade again [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1077.74s)]
*  down the road. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1085.5s)]
*  They need deterrence against Russia. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1086.5s)]
*  And so how to thread the needle between those two things, that's clearly going to be really [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1089.3799999999999s)]
*  hard and that's what we'll be watching from here. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1095.26s)]
*  So obviously we know what Zelensky thinks Ukraine wants and what Ukraine needs, but [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1099.3s)]
*  I'm curious about average Ukrainians. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1104.98s)]
*  Do we know how they feel about the war and peace talks and all of this? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1108.3s)]
*  Well we know from our colleagues in Ukraine that there's extremely deep skepticism across [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1113.9s)]
*  Ukraine that Putin can be seen as a good faith negotiator. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1119.3000000000002s)]
*  At the same time, if you look at our colleagues reporting from Ukraine, you see there's intense [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1125.98s)]
*  fatigue with the war there. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1131.3000000000002s)]
*  The war has lasted almost three years now, which would have been just so unimaginable [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1133.46s)]
*  if we think back to the beginning of 2022. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1138.48s)]
*  Obviously tens of thousands of Ukrainians, both soldiers and civilians have died. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1143.1000000000001s)]
*  And so what you've also been seeing over the last year or so in Ukraine is a higher readiness, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1148.92s)]
*  according to the polls, to make some kind of compromise with Russia. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1155.52s)]
*  Anton, I feel like it's worth taking a step back here and just reckoning with what a headspinning [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1160.1200000000001s)]
*  week this has been. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1166.48s)]
*  We've basically seen the United States embrace Russia over its longstanding allies. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1168.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's still early, but you're right. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1174.3200000000002s)]
*  It really feels like a moment where that world order that we were all used to has started [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1177.56s)]
*  to crumble. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1184.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1185.04s)]
*  Most people listening to this show have grown up in a world where it's a given that the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1186.04s)]
*  United States is aligned with Europe. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1190.62s)]
*  Yeah, you know, there were clearly pretty major bumps along the way that we can remember, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1192.84s)]
*  but I struggle to remember a week like the one that we just saw where JD Vance, Pete [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1198.08s)]
*  Hegseth and Donald Trump himself just shook the foundations of that transatlantic alliance [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1204.84s)]
*  so intensely. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1213.1599999999999s)]
*  And you know, if you think back to Putin and the beginning of his invasion of Ukraine, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  in many ways, this is kind of what he wanted to achieve. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  Before Putin started his invasion, I don't know if you remember, he presented this ultimatum [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1229.96s)]
*  to the West saying NATO needed to withdraw from Eastern and Central Europe and really [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1234.8400000000001s)]
*  give Russia its European sphere of influence back. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1241.44s)]
*  At the time, that seemed like a ludicrous demand. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1246.68s)]
*  The West dismissed it out of hand. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1249.8400000000001s)]
*  But here we are three years later and really kind of talking about many of the things that [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1251.8600000000001s)]
*  Putin demanded. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1257.16s)]
*  Look, make no mistake. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1258.16s)]
*  The cost of all this to Russia has been just extraordinary. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1264.16s)]
*  Maybe a hundred thousand or more Russians have died. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1268.0s)]
*  Something like a million have fled the country. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1271.4s)]
*  The economy has been stretched to its breaking point. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1273.8200000000002s)]

*  War Two is hard to fathom. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1282.5600000000002s)]
*  But if Putin, through these peace talks, is able to settle the war more or less on his [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1285.0400000000002s)]
*  terms, that'll be something he presents as a big victory. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1292.08s)]
*  And an even bigger victory will be if, at the end of all this, he gets the U.S. to walk [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1296.96s)]
*  away from Europe. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1305.08s)]

*  On Sunday, lawyers for President Trump asked the Supreme Court to let him fire the head [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1331.76s)]
*  of a federal agency that safeguards whistleblowers and enforces certain ethics laws. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1336.36s)]
*  The move is the first test of the White House's broader challenge to limits on presidential [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1342.12s)]
*  authority and the ability of a president to fire the leaders of independent agencies that [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1346.52s)]
*  are meant to be insulated from politics. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVSX8wd69bw&t=1352.02s)]
