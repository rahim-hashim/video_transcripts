# A Sudden Escalation in Ukraine Before Trump Takes Office
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zzva0PaBOQ)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  President-elect Donald Trump has promised a radically different approach to foreign
*  policy from the Biden administration, perhaps nowhere more so than in Ukraine, where Trump
*  has pledged to end the war in a day.
*  But just weeks before he's set to take office, the war has taken an unexpected turn.
*  Today, my colleague Anton Trinovsky on the conflict's dangerous new phase.
*  It's Monday, November 25th.
*  So Anton, we've seen this real ratcheting up in the war in Ukraine over the past week.
*  Help us understand what's going on.
*  Well, we've seen a bunch of new developments that are really quite dangerous, quite escalatory.
*  We have seen missiles flying across the border between Russia and Ukraine in a way we haven't
*  seen before.
*  We have seen the Biden administration taking steps that they have not been willing to take
*  before.
*  And we've seen a new kind of rhetoric from President Putin in Moscow.
*  And what this all adds up to is that the war is becoming more dangerous, more volatile.
*  And specifically, what's happening is that we're getting closer to this war in Ukraine
*  turning into a broader war between Russia and the West.
*  So Anton, this is very striking because just a few months ago, we were talking about the
*  Russians digging into positions in eastern Ukraine, and it was this protracted trench
*  warfare.
*  How did we get from there to here?
*  The turning point was early August.
*  The unthinkable for many Russians is now a reality.
*  Their homeland invaded.
*  Ukraine broke that stalemate by invading Russia.
*  It's the first time there's been a foreign incursion of Russia since World War II.
*  Ukrainian troops went into Russia's Kursk region on the border, captured about 400 square
*  miles of territory, and delivered this huge embarrassment to Vladimir Putin, who it turned
*  out couldn't even protect what was internationally recognized Russian territory.
*  Ukraine is proving that it truly knows how to restore justice and is providing the exact
*  pressure needed.
*  That incursion into Kursk was a big morale boost for Ukraine, but it came at a cost.
*  Russians are making gains, capturing partially destroyed villages, raising the Russian tricolor
*  flag.
*  In order to do it, Ukraine had to thin out its troops in eastern Ukraine, where Russia
*  was advancing.
*  They just don't have the personnel to hold all this territory.
*  And as a result, Russia was actually able to push forward in eastern Ukraine at a much
*  higher clip than before.
*  In other words, for the first time in a long time, the front line was actually moving,
*  and it was moving to Russia's advantage.
*  Exactly.
*  And then this fall, Vladimir Putin pulled out his own surprise.
*  The Pentagon confirmed that there are North Korean troops now in Russia, especially in
*  the region of Kursk, which is bringing in North Korean troops.
*  Reportedly, there's something like 10,000 troops from North Korea that are fighting
*  or getting ready to fight on the Russian side.
*  And that was a really remarkable moment, right?
*  Because suddenly it's about more than just Russia and Ukraine.
*  There's a third country involved.
*  Exactly.
*  And think about North Korea, how important that country is strategically as a nuclear
*  armed adversary of the United States.
*  And what it shows about how close the strategic relationship between Russia and North Korea
*  has become, that has sent shockwaves really around the world.
*  Okay, so you've laid out this pretty major shift in the war.
*  But of course, all of this was happening in the months leading up to the US election,
*  won, of course, by Donald Trump.
*  Exactly.
*  And Donald Trump's victory in the election is going to have enormous repercussions for
*  the war.
*  Remember his campaign.
*  He refused to say that he wanted Ukraine to win the war.
*  He promised to end the war in 24 hours, which was widely seen as him being open to a deal
*  that could essentially sell Ukraine out to Russia.
*  He brought on JD Vance as his vice president, who has been extremely critical of American
*  support for Ukraine.
*  So you've had so many signals coming from the Trump camp that his presidency will be
*  much tougher for Ukraine than the Biden presidency was.
*  So Trump's election, in other words, was very bad news for the Ukrainians because the Americans,
*  and Biden in particular, was their biggest ally and he's gone.
*  Yes.
*  So when Donald Trump won, President Zelensky in Ukraine swung into win over Donald Trump
*  mode.
*  And, you know, he was one of the first world leaders to have a phone call with him.
*  He tweeted congratulating Trump on impressive election victory.
*  And so there's a hope in Ukraine that Trump will still want to support their fight, that
*  supporting Ukraine will be kind of a way that Trump projects American strength globally.
*  But still, I think there's a huge amount of concern among supporters of Ukraine everywhere
*  that Trump will just see it as much less of a national interest for the U.S. to allow
*  Ukraine to keep fighting and somehow defeat Russia in this war.
*  Right, which by definition is good for Russia.
*  So tell us how Putin and Russia are thinking about this Trump win.
*  So to step back for a sec, Putin's fundamental bet throughout this war has been that at the
*  end of the day, Russia cares more about Ukraine and is willing to sacrifice more to win in
*  Ukraine than does the West, than do the United States.
*  And so to Putin, Trump's victory shows that at the end of the day, many Americans don't
*  care enough about Ukraine to continue sending tens of billions of dollars of weapons there
*  to be in a situation where Russia is threatening an escalation that could draw the U.S. into
*  a direct war with the world's other nuclear superpower.
*  At the same time, it also brings Putin closer to something he could call victory in Ukraine
*  because Putin's primary goal at this point is not to capture more territory.
*  His main goal is some kind of deal that would allow him to end the war and say he won it.
*  Okay, so basically with Trump's victory, it really seemed like things were on a glide
*  path to exactly the kind of outcome that Putin wanted.
*  Not quite.
*  Because for one thing, Donald Trump is not in power yet.
*  And the Biden administration has been very clear on seeking to continue to support Ukraine.
*  That became even more clear in the last couple of weeks when President Biden made a really
*  important shift in his own policy.
*  For the first time, he allowed Ukraine to use American missiles to strike deep inside
*  Russian territory.
*  These missiles are called Atacams.
*  They have a range of 190 miles.
*  Ukraine has been asking for months, if not longer, to be able to use these missiles for
*  those kinds of strikes inside Russia in order to disrupt Russia's ability to build up its
*  forces, resupply its forces, and wage this war.
*  The Biden administration has resisted that because they feared that that would be the
*  kind of thing that could really push Putin to escalate the war in a new way.
*  But then Putin brought in those North Korean troops that we talked about.
*  And that, apparently, as our colleagues in Washington have reported, is what pushed President
*  Biden to change course and allow Ukraine to use those American missiles for strikes inside Russia.
*  And how soon does Ukraine make use of these long-range rockets?
*  Just about immediately.
*  Tonight, anxious hours after Ukraine fired American-made long-range missiles called Atacams.
*  Last Tuesday, they fired these Atacam missiles and hit an ammunition depot in the Bransk
*  region of southwestern Russia.
*  And then on Wednesday, Ukraine fired Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which are these British-manufactured
*  long-range missiles, into the Kursk region.
*  Neither of those, as far as we know, did massive damage, but the symbolism was enormous.
*  For the first time, Ukraine was firing Western-provided missiles deep into Russian territory, leaving
*  everyone asking, what does Putin do now?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So you've set up this very high-stakes moment for Putin.
*  The U.S. has crossed his red line, allowing the use of these missiles into Russia.
*  They're kind of throwing down the glove, if you will.
*  What does Putin do?
*  The first thing we see is early in the week, less than two days after the news comes out
*  that President Biden is going to allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory with those American-made
*  missiles, Putin approves Russia's revised nuclear doctrine.
*  What does that mean?
*  So it sounds bureaucratic, but it's actually pretty serious.
*  The nuclear doctrine defines how and when Russia would consider using its nuclear weapons.
*  Remember, Russia has a massive stockpile of nuclear weapons.
*  So Putin revises this doctrine to lower the threshold at which Russia would consider using
*  nuclear weapons.
*  Not just that, he also updates it to say that an attack from a non-nuclear state, if backed
*  by a nuclear power, will be treated as a joint attack on Russia.
*  A looser trigger, so to speak.
*  Specifically, it relates to Ukraine because Ukraine is not a nuclear power, but the United
*  States is a nuclear power.
*  Exactly.
*  Putin has this enormous nuclear arsenal, but he hasn't been able to figure out how to use
*  it effectively as a deterrent against the US.
*  And so that's what this new doctrine is about, finding a new way, basically, to scare Americans.
*  And it seems that it did, in a way.
*  Last Wednesday, the US embassy in Kiev issued this urgent warning saying that Russia might
*  launch a significant air attack and closed its embassy and told employees to shelter
*  in place, which was a really rare move.
*  Obviously, Kiev has been attacked many, many times during the course of the last almost
*  three years.
*  And for much of that time, the embassy has been operating.
*  So closing the embassy was another signal that things were getting even more dangerous.
*  So what happens?
*  Was there an attack?
*  So on Thursday, there was.
*  Russia raised the stakes in the war against Ukraine by firing an experimental ballistic
*  missile.
*  And it's the first of its kind to be used in this conflict.
*  Russia does something it hasn't done since the start of the war, which is to use a new
*  something similar to the kind that's used to deliver strategic nuclear weapons.
*  It has a range of 3000 miles.
*  That means it's a weapon that could be capable of reaching targets across Europe.
*  We're talking about something that would be used for a large scale nuclear attack.
*  And it uses this missile to strike in a Ukrainian city, Dnipro.
*  This is a kind of missile that releases multiple warheads.
*  So you see in videos of this attack, these multiple glowing orbs kind of dropping one
*  after the other.
*  It's the kind of missile developed to do really massive damage.
*  To be clear, this particular missile didn't have nuclear warheads in it.
*  But think about the message that that's sending.
*  And on top of all that, these warheads are designed to attack at hypersonic speeds, meaning
*  multiple times the speed of sound.
*  Interesting.
*  So air defenses don't work against them.
*  Exactly.
*  And so it was all about sending this signal that Russia was ready to respond and ready
*  to escalate further.
*  So Putin keeps trying to get the West to listen, to pay attention.
*  Absolutely.
*  And he doesn't just launch that missile.
*  He then gives a speech, a televised speech to the nation of the kind he delivers very
*  rarely.
*  He's sitting in what looks like the same wood paneled office as where he was when he launched
*  the invasion in February 2022.
*  He looked pretty tired, pretty weary, aggrieved.
*  And he says, we consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military facilities
*  of those countries that allowed their weapons to be used against our facilities.
*  In other words, a direct reference to what happened with Biden allowing the use of the
*  ATTACOMS.
*  Exactly.
*  Last week.
*  And so it sounds like what he's saying here is that he would be willing to attack the
*  US.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it's the kind of threat he's made throughout this war, kind of vaguely, but
*  this is the most explicit we've heard him say this.
*  And toward the end of the speech, he lays that out and then comes back with yet another
*  threat.
*  He says, I would like to emphasize once again that it was not Russia, but the United States
*  that destroyed the international security system.
*  And by continuing to fight and cling to its hegemony, they are pushing the whole world
*  into a global conflict.
*  We have always preferred and are ready now to resolve all disputes by peaceful means,
*  but we are also ready for any turn of events.
*  If anyone still doubts this, make no mistake, there will always be a response.
*  So this is pretty remarkable and seems pretty frightening.
*  What did you make of it, Anton?
*  I mean, you've been following Putin for a long time.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Putin has been making threats toward the West, including with references, veiled
*  references to his nuclear arsenal since day one of the invasion.
*  But what makes this situation, I think, particularly concerning is the specificity of it.
*  You know, Putin's previous threats have been quite vague.
*  And so that's the concerning thing here.
*  So what does all of this mean for the possibility of an end to the war, of a settlement like
*  we've been talking about?
*  Well, it's definitely a strange moment because people have been talking more seriously about
*  the potential for a settlement and how that would look than really at any point since
*  the early months of the war.
*  And so as that's happening, you know, you have Putin going essentially all in on this
*  threat that if he continues to make good on it would clearly make it harder for Donald
*  Trump to actually engage in some kind of negotiations with Putin.
*  You know, think about obviously, God forbid, if there were to be a direct Russian attack
*  on any kind of American facility, how could Donald Trump at that point do something that
*  would make it look like he is doing Putin's bidding in Ukraine?
*  Right.
*  But I guess big picture here.
*  Putin does want the war to be over and he seems to be in a pretty good position to achieve
*  that.
*  Yes, he does.
*  But there's still a few weeks to go before Trump comes in and starts trying to end this.
*  And so in the meantime, there's this pretty frantic, incredibly bloody effort by both
*  sides, by both Russia and Ukraine to try to grab as much territory or hold on to as much
*  territory as possible before potential negotiations begin.
*  So what you're seeing for one thing is Putin pushing really hard to get the Ukrainian military
*  out of Kursk.
*  And that, of course, is also where Ukraine is using those new American and British missiles
*  to try to slow the Russian counteroffensive there.
*  And then you've also got Russia really pushing hard in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine,
*  trying to grab as much territory as they can, despite those casualty rates of a thousand
*  people a day or more that Russia is losing.
*  So there's definitely a lot of jockeying happening ahead of the expectation that when Trump comes
*  to power, he'll at least try to create the conditions for some kind of settlement.
*  Okay, so fundamentally, we are now likely looking at the beginning of the end of this
*  war with Putin as the winner.
*  Well, he's still got to get a deal.
*  And ultimately, he'll still need to sit down at some sort of negotiating table to get that.
*  He's been pretty explicit about what he wants.
*  He's made clear that he will not give up territory, the territory that Russia has captured,
*  that's for sure.
*  But what Putin clearly cares more about than territory is the political aspect and the
*  geopolitical aspect of some kind of agreement.
*  So most important is that Ukraine will never join NATO.
*  And then on the other end, of course, Ukraine clearly is going to have a say in this as
*  well.
*  For Ukraine, what's become clear is that for them also, territory is not the most important
*  thing.
*  You know, it does look like there's more and more acceptance that in order to bring this
*  war to a close, Ukraine will have to accept Russian occupation of part of its lands.
*  So what Ukraine cares about the most is what are referred to as security guarantees.
*  How will Ukraine feel assured that Russia won't just reconstitute its forces and attack
*  again a few years from now?
*  So then the question is going to become how can Ukraine get security guarantees without
*  being part of the NATO alliance?
*  Will countries actually sign up for some kind of agreement in which they'll be treaty bound
*  to come to Ukraine's defense if Russia attacks again?
*  Right.
*  If there's anything we've learned over the past few weeks, it's just how tenuous that
*  Western support can be.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  You know, Russia and Ukraine actually did sit down at the negotiating table together
*  in the first few weeks of the war.
*  And one of the reasons we've reported that that negotiation fell apart back in the spring
*  of 2022 is that they couldn't actually figure out a mechanism for those security guarantees
*  for Ukraine that would work.
*  How do you make Ukraine feel reasonably safe from a new Russian attack?
*  That was never solved back then and it's clearly going to be the biggest challenge now.
*  And that's a really hard problem to solve.
*  The West is tired and it clearly does not seem very inclined to come to the aid of Ukraine,
*  this country that is the obsession of this very tenacious and very dangerous leader,
*  Putin.
*  So at the end of the day, Anton, is Putin getting away with it?
*  Well, let's remember first of all that both the West and Putin have been surprised repeatedly
*  during this war by Ukraine's tenacity and Ukraine's will to fight.
*  We have not seen much sign at this point, even though Ukrainian soldiers are clearly
*  very tired and Ukraine is struggling to get enough men on the battlefield.
*  But still, we're not seeing that Ukraine is actually ready to stop fighting.
*  You know, and that means you could even imagine a scenario where even if Trump tries to force
*  some kind of peace deal, Ukraine might try to continue to fight.
*  But big picture, Sabrina, you raise an important point.
*  Putin has been waging the biggest war of aggression that Europe has seen since World War II.
*  It's a war that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives in terms of killed and injured soldiers
*  and not to mention the civilians that have died in Ukraine.
*  But despite all the Western sanctions and the tremendous amounts of weaponry that Ukraine
*  has received from the West, Putin is still going.
*  Domestically, he's as powerful as he's ever been.
*  And globally, you know, he may be a pariah in the West, but outside the West, Russia
*  continues to have a lot of influence.
*  So as we approach the three-year mark of this war, it is time, I think, for serious questions
*  about what the West has and hasn't been able to accomplish in supporting Ukraine.
*  The West has been able to keep Ukraine in the fight, but it has not been able to stop Putin.
*  Anton, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  President-elect Donald Trump has picked Scott Besant to serve as Treasury Secretary.
*  Besant is a billionaire hedge fund manager who once supported Democrats, but now endorses
*  the Republican agenda of cutting taxes, rolling back federal regulations, and enacting the
*  sweeping tariffs that Trump has promised.
*  He'll also oversee trade talks with China.
*  The selection came after weeks of debate by Trump and his advisors about who should win
*  the most prominent economic job in his administration.
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Astha Chaturvedi, Michael Simon Johnson, and
*  Will Reid.
*  It was edited by Maria Byrne and Patricia Willems with help from Michael Benoit, contains
*  original music by Marian Lozano, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonderly.
