# Can the Cease-Fire in Gaza Hold?
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I)
*  From The New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=4.28s)]
*  Today, as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas enters its final phase, no one knows [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=8.0s)]
*  who will control the future of Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=17.0s)]
*  Israel, Hamas, or possibly President Trump. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=19.76s)]
*  My colleague, Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley, walks us through this delicate [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=24.92s)]
*  moment and the questions hovering over the future of the war. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=29.160000000000004s)]
*  It's Wednesday, February 26th. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  Patrick, we're in the final days of the first phase of the ceasefire deal between Israel [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=40.92s)]
*  and Hamas, which was outlined very clearly in terms of what each side had to give to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=48.52s)]
*  the other. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=53.04s)]
*  And now we're entering into this next phase, which is not yet negotiated and could lead [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=54.32s)]
*  to more talks, but it could also end up leading just to more war, which we'll get to in a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=59.68s)]
*  moment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=64.36s)]
*  But just to start, how in your estimation has this first part of the process actually [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=65.36s)]
*  gone? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=71.36s)]
*  Several many crises aside, it has gone roughly to plan. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=74.14s)]
*  That plan was to exchange 33 hostages held in Gaza by Hamas and its allies for roughly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=78.86s)]
*  1500 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israeli jails. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=89.34s)]
*  Just to recap, at the start of the war, Hamas and its allies raided Israel, captured roughly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=97.54s)]
*  250 hostages, both dead and alive, brought them back to Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=104.98s)]
*  Some of them were exchanged in a previous hostage for prisoner deal in late 2023. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=110.98s)]
*  A handful have been rescued in Israeli military operations, but roughly 100 were still in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=119.18s)]
*  captivity in January when this ceasefire was sealed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=130.46s)]
*  And the deal allows for roughly a third of them, most of them alive, but some of them [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=135.94s)]
*  dead to be swapped for Palestinian prisoners who variously had been jailed 20 years ago [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=140.42000000000002s)]
*  for their role in terrorist attacks on Israelis, but also hundreds of Palestinians who had [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=146.94s)]
*  arrested without charge inside Gaza by the Israeli military and held in difficult conditions [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=154.7s)]
*  inside the Israeli prison archipelago. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=163.22s)]
*  And as I say, the broad picture is that those have mostly gone as they were expected to. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=167.22s)]
*  But there have been some immensely traumatic scenes for both Israelis and Palestinians [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  that have led to constant fears that this initial ceasefire was about to collapse. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=181.17999999999998s)]
*  Tell us about those. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=188.34s)]
*  Well, every Saturday, the choreography would go like this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=189.33999999999997s)]
*  The hostages would be released from Gaza, and then once they were free, the prisoners [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  would be released from Israel. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  But the spectacles of both releases drew immense pain and anger on both sides. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=203.5s)]
*  When the three or four hostages that were supposed to be released that day were freed, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=215.3s)]
*  they were put up on stage in front of cheering crowds to bombastic music, often set against [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=221.18s)]
*  the Spanners that attacked Israel and sought to humiliate the Israeli military. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=230.62s)]
*  The hostages themselves often looked extremely gaunt, malnourished, starved, which sent shockwaves [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=239.02s)]
*  through Israeli society. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=245.74s)]
*  And sometimes they would be interviewed on stage, seemingly against their will, asked [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=252.3s)]
*  humiliating questions about their time in captivity or asked to send messages to the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=258.78s)]
*  Israeli political leadership. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  On the Palestinian side, there were also some uncomfortable scenes of prisoners emerging [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=269.5s)]
*  from Israeli prisons in very bad shape. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=276.7s)]
*  Some of them were forced to wear clothes that said words to the effect of, we will never [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=281.5s)]
*  forget a reference to the crimes that they were jailed for 20 years ago. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=287.94s)]
*  And so there was anger among both societies about the way that these releases were being [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=295.82s)]
*  conducted. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=301.42s)]
*  And that culminated in perhaps the most unsettling and disturbing hostage release ceremony of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=302.8s)]
*  last week when the bodies of three Israeli civilians from the same family, two very young [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=312.06s)]
*  boys, Ariel Bebas and his brother, Kefir Bebas, four years old and eight months old, respectively, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=320.94s)]
*  at the time of their capture in October 2023, and their mother, Shiri Bebas, a 32-year-old [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=328.3s)]
*  accountant. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  Those bodies were supposed to be released back to Israel last Thursday. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=338.34s)]
*  And they were handed over to members of the Red Cross in front of big crowds of Palestinians [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=345.02s)]
*  and against the visual backdrop of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, looking [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=354.94s)]
*  like a vampire dripping with blood. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=361.74s)]
*  To imply that it's the prime minister's fault that these three people are dead. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=366.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=371.7s)]
*  The Hamas claim was that these two very young children and their mother were killed in Israeli [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=372.98s)]
*  airstrikes and that Netanyahu and the Israeli military was to blame for their deaths, along [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=380.82s)]
*  with the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=387.46s)]
*  Those images of a vampiric Netanyahu seemed to be stuck to not only the banner on the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=392.94s)]
*  stage that was at the center of this handing over ceremony, but also on the coffins themselves. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=399.1s)]
*  This was seen in Israel as enormously disrespectful ghoulish, essentially. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=405.9s)]
*  That impression was taken to the nth degree once the bodies were examined back in Israel. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=414.06s)]
*  The Israeli military said that the two boys were not killed in Israeli airstrikes and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=423.34s)]
*  that an autopsy had revealed that they were killed by militants inside Gaza after their [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=429.02s)]
*  capture. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=436.22s)]
*  And then they revealed something even more shocking, that the body of their mother, Shiri [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=437.38s)]
*  Bebas, was not actually her body at all. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=443.54s)]
*  It was the body of someone else completely, perhaps a Palestinian woman, who had been [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=446.18s)]
*  sent back either by mistake or by design to Israel. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=451.1s)]
*  And this was a shocking piece of news for the Israeli public. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=456.34s)]
*  This family had been one of the main emblems of Israeli trauma on October the 7th. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=462.34s)]
*  And so to see the spectacle of these two young children and their mother being returned in [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=470.17999999999995s)]
*  this way, and then on top of that to learn that the mother, Shiri, was in fact still [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=474.9s)]
*  in Gaza, was an immensely triggering and re-traumatizing event. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=479.73999999999995s)]
*  And was the body of Shiri Bebas actually returned? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=486.14s)]
*  It was, ultimately. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=488.82s)]
*  Hamas said it searched again in the place where the Bebas family was buried alongside [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=490.62s)]
*  Palestinians killed during Israeli airstrikes at some point in the course of the war. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=495.86s)]
*  And they quickly found the right body and returned it back to Israel. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=501.42s)]
*  And that family was finally able to have some degree of closure. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=506.46s)]
*  But the fury of the Israeli government did not die down once Shiri Bebas's body was returned. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=511.58s)]
*  The whole incident contributed to the Israeli decision to delay the release of the prisoners [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=520.66s)]
*  who were meant to be exchanged for the Bebas's bodies. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=527.38s)]
*  I mean, all of this, as you said, sounds just so ghoulish, the parading of these emaciated [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=531.4599999999999s)]
*  people, this mix-up with the body. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=536.8199999999999s)]
*  Given the reaction to all of this within Israel and the fact that it has, as you mentioned, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=540.54s)]
*  held up the return of these Palestinian prisoners, what is Hamas thinking here? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=545.3s)]
*  What is the strategy? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=550.06s)]
*  Why are the hostages being treated this way? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=551.56s)]
*  There's a few different reasons. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=554.38s)]
*  In part, it's seen as a counterpoint to the way that Palestinian detainees and prisoners [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=556.66s)]
*  are being released in what Palestinians see as a very humiliating manner. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=562.5s)]
*  But it's also a means of projecting power and authority. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=567.26s)]
*  They want to remind both the Palestinians of Gaza and the people of Israel that despite [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=572.64s)]
*  16 months of war that was meant to force them from power in Gaza, they are very much still [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=578.4599999999999s)]
*  in charge. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=585.8599999999999s)]
*  And are they actually in charge, given how much damage Israel has done to Gaza, the infrastructure, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=587.2199999999999s)]
*  killing their leaders, destroying the tunnels? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=593.66s)]
*  It's hard to know exactly what level of authority or capacity they have in Gaza because we're [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=597.54s)]
*  not allowed in. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=603.26s)]
*  The Israeli government is still not letting journalists into Gaza. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=604.26s)]
*  However, it does seem from these videos and what reporting we are able to do that they [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=608.42s)]
*  are still the dominant force in Gaza. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=613.5s)]
*  And if they want to organize a dramatic rally to send off the bodies of Israeli children [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=615.9s)]
*  on their way back to Israel, they can very much do that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=624.1s)]
*  And the message is very clear. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=627.82s)]
*  Whatever the Israeli government has said about killing thousands and thousands of Hamas militants, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=629.78s)]
*  they still have some men left. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=635.06s)]
*  They still have lots of vehicles. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=637.88s)]
*  They still have lots of guns. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=640.04s)]
*  And any discussion about the future of Gaza, any discussion about end to the war has to [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=641.88s)]
*  take their presence into account. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  Given that Israel did not achieve its intended goal of eliminating Hamas in the war, where [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=651.78s)]
*  does that leave the war and the ceasefire in this next phase? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=656.5s)]
*  It leaves us in a very uncertain place. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=661.2s)]
*  All throughout this last six weeks, as the hostages were being exchanged for prisoners, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=663.96s)]
*  Israel and Hamas were supposed to have been negotiating through mediators about a more [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=670.1600000000001s)]
*  wholesale agreement to end the war and about the future governance of Gaza. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=676.1400000000001s)]
*  Because they have such completely different visions for how that should look, the two [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=683.76s)]
*  sides have not been able to even start negotiations. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=689.2s)]
*  And that means we're approaching the end of these 42 days that constitute the first phase [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=692.78s)]
*  of the ceasefire and that end at midnight on Saturday night without a clear sense of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=699.2s)]
*  what's going to happen next. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=705.6s)]
*  So what are the possible outcomes here after Saturday night? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=708.32s)]
*  Can you just walk us through them? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=710.98s)]
*  The first and most likely outcome is that the truce continues in a very informal, unstructured [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=712.98s)]
*  way at least for a few days. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=722.7800000000001s)]
*  The wording of the current deal allows for the truce to continue even if there is no [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=726.2600000000001s)]
*  agreement about how the truce should continue, as long as there are negotiations still taking [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=732.4200000000001s)]
*  place. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=739.2600000000001s)]
*  Another option, and this is something that has been proposed in recent days by Steve [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=741.44s)]
*  Whitcoff, President Trump's Middle East envoy, is that there could be a brief formal extension [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=746.2800000000001s)]
*  of the ceasefire, more or less on the same terms that the ceasefire has been observed [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=754.48s)]
*  thus far. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=759.72s)]
*  And that would involve an exchange of a few more hostages for several hundred more prisoners. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=760.72s)]
*  And it wouldn't solve the fundamental disagreement about whether the war should end entirely [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=768.4s)]
*  or who should govern Gaza after the war, but it would keep the arrangement going for another [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=773.72s)]
*  week, two weeks, maybe even three weeks. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=780.88s)]
*  The third option, and it's extremely unlikely that they'll reach this point, is that there [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  might be a deal about who should govern Gaza next, should the war end entirely, but that's [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=788.4399999999999s)]
*  something that is almost impossible to reach right now just because the two sides are so [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=795.28s)]
*  far apart about what that would look like. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=799.8399999999999s)]
*  So if both sides cannot come to a deal by the weekend or an extension, as you described, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=804.24s)]
*  is it possible that the war is just going to start again? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=809.8s)]
*  And if so, what is that going to look like? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=813.16s)]
*  It's very possible. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=816.14s)]
*  Whether that happens on Sunday morning, I'm not sure. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=817.14s)]
*  It's probably more likely that the ceasefire would stutter on for a little bit longer, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  but it is possible that the war could resume. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=824.8s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said as much earlier this week, he said that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=827.3599999999999s)]
*  Israel is ready to go back to war. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=832.88s)]
*  And we understand from our own reporting that there are very extensive plans in place to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=835.64s)]
*  return to fighting. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=841.56s)]
*  So basically, the options here are go back to war or make some sort of short term extension [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=844.4799999999999s)]
*  of the ceasefire. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=850.8399999999999s)]
*  Are there any longer term options on the table for a durable peace deal? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=852.5799999999999s)]
*  There are plenty of longer term options that have been suggested by governments, analysts, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=858.1s)]
*  politicians, diplomats, Arabs, Israelis, Westerners. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=862.86s)]
*  None of them are particularly viable because they all require a degree of compromise from [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=868.54s)]
*  the two main actors. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=871.98s)]
*  Perhaps the most dramatic and consequential has been the one proposed in recent weeks [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=873.58s)]
*  by President Trump himself. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=884.74s)]
*  You have to learn from history. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=888.94s)]
*  History has, you know, just can't let it keep repeating itself. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=890.82s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=894.32s)]
*  And I don't want to be cute. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=899.34s)]
*  I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=900.7s)]
*  that could be so back. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=904.7800000000001s)]
*  This could be so magnificent. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=906.1s)]
*  But more importantly than that is the people that... [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=908.5400000000001s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=917.4200000000001s)]
*  So, Patrick, how has President Trump's quote unquote Riviera vision of the Gaza Strip affected [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=918.38s)]
*  the negotiations over the ceasefire and what comes next for Gaza? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=932.86s)]
*  Well, let's just start with what the plan actually was. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=936.54s)]
*  Today I'm delighted to welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back to the White [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=940.54s)]
*  House. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=945.86s)]
*  This was a proposal put forth by President Trump in the White House in a seemingly impromptu [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=947.26s)]
*  way as he stood at a lectern beside the Israeli Prime Minister a few weeks ago. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=955.06s)]
*  The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=962.02s)]
*  And in this proposal, President Trump suggested depopulating Gaza. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=967.34s)]
*  Essentially forcing its 2 million residents to leave their homes and live for years in [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=972.98s)]
*  mainly Egypt and also Jordan. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=995.1800000000001s)]
*  Thank you all very much. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1000.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1001.66s)]
*  And this was such an outlandish proposal that no one really knew what to do with it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1003.3399999999999s)]
*  Did the President of the United States really think it would be possible to move 2 million [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1012.02s)]
*  people from one part of the world to another? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1017.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1022.18s)]
*  So this is actually a more extreme proposal than any American president, I think, has [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1023.18s)]
*  proposed in modern times, if not ever. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1027.78s)]
*  So what has the reaction to it been? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1030.94s)]
*  In Israel, there's been a mixture of enthusiasm and caution. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1033.78s)]
*  Enthusiasm from the Israeli right. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1039.94s)]
*  For years, the Israeli right wing has wanted Israel to return to Gaza, which it occupied [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1042.6599999999999s)]
*  wholly between 1967 and 2005, and reestablish Israeli settlements throughout the territory. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1050.22s)]
*  Then there's the Israeli center that's more cautious, that sees this as a pie in the sky [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1059.02s)]
*  kind of plan that could cause more disruption than it's worth. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1062.5400000000002s)]
*  And then from the Palestinians, you have a feeling of abject horror that 75 years after [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1067.46s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced to leave their homes or fled their [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1074.18s)]
*  homes during the wars surrounding Israel's creation. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1079.76s)]
*  Now, another generation of Palestinians would in turn themselves be forced to leave their [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1084.98s)]
*  homes for the second time in two or three generations. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1091.6599999999999s)]
*  Yes, and I can imagine to those Palestinians, it would feel a lot like a second expulsion. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1096.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1102.6599999999999s)]
*  In 1948, in the wars surrounding Israel's creation, somewhere north of 700,000 Palestinians [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1103.6599999999999s)]
*  fled or were forced to flee their homes in what has become the kind of foundational trauma [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1112.86s)]
*  of Palestinian history, referred to by Palestinians and indeed across the Arab world as the Nakba [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1120.06s)]
*  or an English catastrophe. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1126.54s)]
*  And the sense that two million Palestinians in 2025 could be forced to leave their homes, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1129.02s)]
*  however much this has been portrayed as a humanitarian gesture by the Trump administration, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1137.1s)]
*  feels very much like a second Nakba. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1142.62s)]
*  And where are the Arab countries in all of this, the ones that Trump talks about in his [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1146.36s)]
*  plan, Jordan and Egypt and others, because Trump is basically suggesting that they would [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1150.26s)]
*  have to take in millions of Palestinian refugees. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1155.1799999999998s)]
*  So what have they said in response to that idea? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1158.86s)]
*  Well, at first, they displayed the same kind of horror and anger that we saw from Palestinians, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1162.1s)]
*  partly out of solidarity for the Palestinian cause, but also the need to care for and provide [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1169.74s)]
*  for such a large number of people was considered an immensely destabilizing idea that could [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1177.34s)]
*  have both created social and political chaos for the Egyptian and Jordanian governments. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1185.34s)]
*  So they rejected this plan. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1192.3999999999999s)]
*  And then gradually out of that horror and rejection came a slightly different response, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1195.02s)]
*  which was not acceptance, but it was the realization that the Egyptians, the Jordanians, the Saudis, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1202.1799999999998s)]
*  other leading Arab countries that are allied with the U.S. needed to come up with their [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1208.72s)]
*  own response, their own proposal for the governance of postwar Gaza. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1214.34s)]
*  And that's exactly what we see happening in the capitals of the Arab world today. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1222.9399999999998s)]
*  What's really striking here is that basically, to put it another way, even if all these Arab [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1229.58s)]
*  countries hated this idea that Trump floated out there, it does actually light a fire under [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1233.58s)]
*  them to meet and start discussing other options. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1238.06s)]
*  That's one way of putting it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1241.4199999999998s)]
*  And it is also now what the Trump administration and its top envoys are saying was the intention [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1243.06s)]
*  of President Trump when he made this proposal in the first place. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1249.3799999999999s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, his Middle East envoy, said last week that President Trump didn't mean [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1253.8999999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1261.1s)]
*  Literally, he meant to get the Arab world talking and proposing their own ideas to help [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1262.1s)]
*  try to break this deadlock about Gaza's future that has been hanging over the region for [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1267.98s)]
*  the last 16 months, if not the last 75 years. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1275.46s)]
*  What kind of plan are they talking about exactly? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1279.94s)]
*  And more importantly, how would it actually work? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1281.94s)]
*  It's not yet clear. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1284.98s)]
*  The leaders of the Arab world, or most of them, met last week in Riyadh to try and thrash [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1286.54s)]
*  out a proposal. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1291.6200000000001s)]
*  They're meant to meet again next week in Cairo to talk more. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1293.82s)]
*  From what we understand about what's being discussed at these meetings, the main proposals [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1299.86s)]
*  are for the leaders of the Arab world to have some kind of oversight over a local Palestinian [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1305.82s)]
*  governing authority that does not include Hamas in exchange for Israel promising that [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1314.06s)]
*  At some point in the future, Gaza and the West Bank, the other main territory where [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1321.9199999999998s)]
*  Palestinians live under Israeli occupation, will be able to become their own sovereign [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1328.06s)]
*  Palestinian state. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1335.08s)]
*  The problem with this proposal is that it requires both Hamas to give up power and Israel [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1336.6999999999998s)]
*  to promise Palestinian sovereignty. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1344.02s)]
*  Neither of those two things seem very likely at the moment. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1346.0s)]
*  Because basically, each side wants something that the other side, at least at this point, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  is absolutely unwilling to give up. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1355.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1357.88s)]
*  That was the case before President Trump made his proposal, and it remains the case now. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1358.88s)]
*  And the whole thing is reminiscent of trying to solve a Rubik's Cube. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1363.6000000000001s)]
*  You turn the cube in one direction and you bring two squares slightly closer to where [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1370.28s)]
*  you want them to be. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1376.24s)]
*  At the same time, you dislodge another square, bringing yourself back to where you were a [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1377.24s)]
*  moment ago. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1383.84s)]
*  In the negotiations to try and solve the Rubik's Cube of the Gaza war, all sides, including [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1385.36s)]
*  some of the people trying to mediate, have got their own preconditions and own desired [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1393.56s)]
*  completely incompatible with those of the others. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1400.64s)]
*  And to be specific, Israel wants a post-war Gaza that does not involve Hamas governing [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1404.8400000000001s)]
*  it or exerting any kind of military power. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1413.92s)]
*  Hamas wants a post-war Gaza in which it still plays a significant political role and it [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1417.68s)]
*  still gets to keep its military wing intact, posing a threat, conceivably, to Israel. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1425.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, you also have the Arab leaders from Egypt, Jordan, and elsewhere now trying [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1433.72s)]
*  to produce their own halfway house that would involve Hamas stepping down. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1439.96s)]
*  But also, in exchange for their involvement, Israel would need to promise to give the Palestinians [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1445.9199999999998s)]
*  a state. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1452.8s)]
*  Israel would be happy with the first bit, getting rid of Hamas. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1454.28s)]
*  They would not be happy with the second bit, giving the Palestinians a state. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1457.76s)]
*  This actually sounds harder than a Rubik's Cube. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1463.84s)]
*  People have actually solved a Rubik's Cube. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1465.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1468.12s)]
*  And the riddle of Gaza has not been solved in the last 60 months of war, but also not [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1469.12s)]
*  really over the last 75 years of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1475.1399999999999s)]
*  Ever since Israel was established in 1948, the future of Gaza has been a conundrum that [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1481.04s)]
*  no one has been able to really solve, least of all now. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1488.6s)]
*  On the one hand, Patrick, it feels like we are exactly where we were before the war started, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1493.32s)]
*  except obviously now there are tens of thousands of people who are dead. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1498.1599999999999s)]
*  There are more people who are traumatized and radicalized. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1501.32s)]
*  But on the other hand, we do have some of these leaders in the Arab world at the negotiating [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1504.72s)]
*  table. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1510.32s)]
*  And so it feels like maybe there's this slight possibility that Trump may have thrown a big [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1511.32s)]
*  enough curveball into the mix that the logjam could actually be broken, solve the riddle [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1517.12s)]
*  of Gaza, as you called it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1522.76s)]
*  So can you just kind of help put this all into perspective for us? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1524.04s)]
*  One of the implicit consequences of President Trump proposing such a dramatic plan is it [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1528.68s)]
*  really underscored the idea that Trump is acting in lockstep with Israeli interests, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1535.76s)]
*  even more than President Biden was perceived to be. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1543.0s)]
*  The supporters of that approach say that it is likely to place more pressure on Hamas [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1554.92s)]
*  to compromise because it believes that there is no daylight between Israel and its biggest [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1561.0s)]
*  benefactor, the United States. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1567.24s)]
*  The critics of that approach say that rather than making Hamas more likely to compromise, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1571.16s)]
*  it'll in fact make Israel less likely to compromise because it believes that it can return to [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1576.92s)]
*  war, return to the kinds of deadly and bloody fighting that we saw until January with the [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1583.64s)]
*  United States' full support. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1589.8799999999999s)]
*  And that raises the specter of the ceasefire breaking down, if not in days, then at least [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1593.3999999999999s)]
*  in weeks, and a return to the devastating destruction that we've seen over the last [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1599.8999999999999s)]
*  16 months. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1606.1999999999998s)]
*  Patrick, thank you very much. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1608.1999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1616.84s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1619.84s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1641.84s)]
*  On Tuesday, a group of federal tech workers resigned rather than help Elon Musk and his [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1643.8799999999999s)]
*  allies with their agenda to dramatically reshape the federal government. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1648.6s)]
*  In a scathing letter to the White House, the 21 employees of the U.S. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1653.24s)]
*  Digital Service said they would not support what they described as the breaking of critical [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1657.24s)]
*  systems and the mishandling of sensitive data. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1661.84s)]
*  The resignations come after Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in just over one month [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1665.6s)]
*  has ended contracts, laid off workers and shuttered entire federal agencies. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1670.6399999999999s)]
*  And in a major concession to President Trump, Ukraine has agreed to give the United States [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1675.96s)]
*  money from its mineral resources. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1682.28s)]
*  The deal follows an intense pressure campaign that included threats and insults as Trump [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1685.24s)]
*  increasingly pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a quote unquote payback in exchange [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1689.96s)]
*  for continued support in Ukraine's war with Russia. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1695.4s)]
*  The details of the deal aren't clear yet, including whether President Trump has committed [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1698.96s)]
*  any specific security support at all. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omMoMsA9D0I&t=1703.12s)]
