# The Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs Verdict
**New York Times - The Daily:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=4.54s)]
*  On Wednesday morning, after a seven-week trial whose every turn has grabbed headlines, a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=11.08s)]
*  jury found Sean Combs, the music mogul known as Diddy, not guilty of the most serious charges [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=16.52s)]
*  against him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=23.28s)]
*  Today, I speak with Ben Cesario about why the prosecution's case fell short at trial, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=25.32s)]
*  and Jodie Cantor on what the verdict may tell us about how prosecutors and juries see sexual [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=31.36s)]
*  abuse cases. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=37.2s)]
*  It's Thursday, July 3rd. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=45.2s)]
*  Ben, hi. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=54.68s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=60.68s)]
*  Are you outside the courthouse right now? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=61.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm right around the corner from the federal courthouse downtown. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=67.2s)]
*  Well, we'll try not to take up too much of your time, but very happy to have you here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=68.2s)]
*  As we know, since we did an episode on this with you last week, Diddy has been on trial [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=73.12s)]
*  for the last two months or so facing sex trafficking and racketeering charges. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=78.16s)]
*  These are accusations that centered on the argument that he had coerced two ex-girlfriends [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=83.64s)]
*  into repeated sex sessions with multiple men. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=88.8s)]
*  The jury started its deliberations on Monday, and you were at the courthouse today when [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=93.36s)]
*  the verdict was announced. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=99.16s)]
*  So tell me how it unfolded. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=100.84s)]
*  Well, it started like most mornings where there's a long line of people to get into [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=103.4s)]
*  the courthouse. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=107.8s)]
*  There's all the reporters, but then there's influencers and just members of the public [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=109.56s)]
*  who have been showing up every day at this point after two months. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=114.64s)]
*  I recognize a lot of them, and we say good morning to each other, and we head inside [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  the court building. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=122.08s)]
*  There was a real sense of tension about this because we've all been waiting for the verdict [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=123.36s)]
*  for two months now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=130.4s)]
*  The other thing is that on Tuesday, the jury told the judge that they had reached a verdict [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=132.6s)]
*  on four of the five counts against Sean Combs, but they were still deadlocked on the fifth [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=140.32s)]
*  one, which is the racketeering conspiracy charge. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=147.28s)]
*  Since they said that, I think everybody has been trying to game out in their minds how [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=151.32s)]
*  this day might go. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=155.92s)]
*  So what happened when things started today? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=158.92s)]
*  It started off pretty normal. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  The jury was deliberating, and then a little later in the morning, a note was delivered [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=163.44s)]
*  and word got around that the jury had reached a verdict. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=169.68s)]
*  So Sean Combs comes in. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=173.16s)]
*  He's accompanied by the US Marshals who have brought him in every day of the trial. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=174.24s)]
*  He gets to his seat, looks to his family who are seated right in the front of the public [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=179.28s)]
*  gallery, and he mouths to them, we got this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=184.12s)]
*  And he has a copy with him of the 11th Psalm, which is the one that begins, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=188.56s)]
*  In the Lord I take refuge. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=192.36s)]
*  It's about putting your trust in God. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=194.88s)]
*  The jury comes in, and the four person is called on by the judge to read their verdict. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=197.36s)]
*  And the first count that's read is racketeering conspiracy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=203.56s)]
*  This is one of the most serious charges he was facing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=207.4s)]
*  It carries a potential life sentence. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=209.8s)]
*  It's also one of the trickiest ones for the government to prove. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=212.44s)]
*  It's a very complicated law, and the verdict was not guilty. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=215.68s)]
*  And you could see the release on Sean Combs, the feeling of relief that he has been found [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=221.08s)]
*  not guilty of this very serious charge. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a big moment. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=231.24s)]
*  Big moment, very dramatic moment in the courtroom. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  And then they get to the second count, which is sex trafficking of Cassie. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=235.24s)]
*  Cassie, his ex-girlfriend. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=239.84s)]
*  Cassie, his ex-girlfriend, who got this entire thing started when she filed a lawsuit against [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=242.08s)]
*  him a year and a half ago. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=247.96s)]
*  And she was definitely the star witness in the trial. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  She was on the stand for four days giving pretty grueling testimony about her experience [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=254.52s)]
*  with Combs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=259.32s)]
*  But the jury found that Sean Combs was not guilty of sex trafficking of her. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  So two wins right off the bat for him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  The next count that they read was transportation to engage in prostitution related to Cassie's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=269.56s)]
*  story. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=276.0s)]
*  This is also known as the Mann Act. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=277.24s)]
*  It's a law that says it's illegal to transport people across state lines for the purpose [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=279.04s)]
*  of prostitution. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=284.48s)]
*  And it was guilty. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=286.48s)]
*  So now he's been found guilty of one charge, but not of two others. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=288.72s)]
*  Okay, what about the rest? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  So the next one is sex trafficking of a woman known as Jane. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=296.48s)]
*  This is an anonymous woman who was Combs' girlfriend after Cassie. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=301.28s)]
*  And she told, in some ways, a very similar story to Cassie about being coerced into these [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=306.92s)]
*  long sex marathons with prostitutes, but not guilty. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=312.74s)]
*  And the fifth and last count that was read was another transportation to engage in prostitution, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=318.28s)]
*  this time related to Jane. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=324.58s)]
*  And it was guilty for that one. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=326.46s)]
*  So just to sum up here, Ben, he's found not guilty of these two really serious charges, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=328.58s)]
*  racketeering and sex trafficking in the case of both of these former girlfriends. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=337.38s)]
*  But he is found guilty of this lesser charge, which is essentially hiring a sex worker. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=343.5s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=351.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=353.02s)]
*  He's been acquitted of by far the most serious charges, the ones that could have landed him [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  life in prison, and that the government had really built its entire case around. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=359.34s)]
*  He still was found guilty of two counts of a federal crime, but the sentence is a lot [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=365.26s)]
*  lower and the crime itself is regarded as far less serious than racketeering and sex [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=370.82s)]
*  trafficking. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  A family who have been in court almost every day and some supporters behind them were in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=379.66s)]
*  just jubilation when the not guilty verdicts were read, cheering, clapping, holding their [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=386.86s)]
*  arms up in the air. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  And it sounds like Diddy and his team are viewing this as a huge win just based on their [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=395.38000000000005s)]
*  reaction. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=401.26000000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=402.26000000000005s)]
*  Short of a full acquittal, this was the best outcome he could have hoped for. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=403.26000000000005s)]
*  The body language from him was like utterly different than we had seen even just the day [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  before when he seemed quite worried about the way this might all play out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=414.24s)]
*  And he thanked the jury as they filed out of the room. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=420.36s)]
*  And there was just a sort of palpable relief from him. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  His lawyers were all smiling and the prosecutors who are seated at the table in front of them [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=428.09999999999997s)]
*  who represent the federal government were looking straight ahead, stone faced. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=433.96s)]
*  Okay, I want to walk through the two big buckets of charges that he was found not guilty of. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  First let's talk about what we said the last time that we talked was always going to be [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  the more complicated of the two charges, which is racketeering conspiracy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=449.68s)]
*  The prosecution here, as you told us, needed to prove that Diddy had a network of employees [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  who were all actively helping him commit these crimes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  Why do you think the jury didn't buy the prosecution's argument? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=464.23999999999995s)]
*  Well we can't read their minds and we haven't heard from any of the jurors yet. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  But I think that the government maybe just didn't persuade them that this machine that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  Sean Combs had of assistance and bodyguards and all these people who worked for him, even [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=481.28s)]
*  if it was a perfectly well-oiled machine, that its purpose was committing crimes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  That the employees knew, if they're conspirators, then it means that they knew that they were [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=493.88s)]
*  engaged in something illegal. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=499.72s)]
*  There was conflicting testimony about what the assistants did know about these sexual [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=502.32s)]
*  encounters which were called freak-offs at the trial, whether they knew what was happening [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=509.6s)]
*  in the room or they didn't know what was happening in the room. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=515.2s)]
*  Right, yes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=518.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean there were these questions about whether these were accomplices or just employees doing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=519.1600000000001s)]
*  a job who didn't actually know what they were participating in effectively. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that was certainly the defense's position that the government hadn't proved that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=531.08s)]
*  The government argued very strongly, but I think when it came to the jury, they just [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  didn't buy it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=542.2s)]
*  Okay, now let's turn to the second charge which by comparison seemed more straightforward, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  the sex trafficking charge. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  The prosecution argued that these two former girlfriends were essentially forced into these [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=550.0s)]
*  freak-offs. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=553.96s)]
*  It seems as though the jury though was more persuaded by the defense's position, which [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=556.6s)]
*  is that the girlfriends were willing participants in these encounters. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=563.38s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=568.32s)]
*  Either that or that they just didn't believe beyond a reasonable doubt that they were coerced. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=570.28s)]
*  Maybe they bought the defense's position fully. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=577.6s)]
*  Maybe they just didn't feel persuaded by the story that the government told that these [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=581.6s)]
*  women were coerced even just in certain instances over the course of the long relationships [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=586.4s)]
*  that Combs had with these women. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=593.16s)]
*  He was with Cassie for over a decade and the government actually said, we're not arguing [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=595.04s)]
*  that every single time they did this it was coerced, but we are saying that it happened [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=599.9s)]
*  sometimes and they pointed to a few particular episodes of that. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=605.22s)]
*  And just to remind folks who may not have been following this as closely as you were, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=609.34s)]
*  the jury was adjudicating that question of were they coerced into this or not based on [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=613.9399999999999s)]
*  a huge body of text messages, right, that these women had with Diddy that was presented [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  at trial. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=625.92s)]
*  Well, there was also a testimony from the two women who had the longest time on the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=627.28s)]
*  stand of any witness. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=632.4s)]
*  Cassie was on the stand for four days. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=634.56s)]
*  Jane was on the stand for six days. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=636.8s)]
*  And they told very gripping, upsetting stories about the things that had happened in their [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=639.4799999999999s)]
*  relationship. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  But the defense's strategy was to undermine them with those text messages. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=646.5999999999999s)]
*  And there were hundreds of them that they presented at court where they would make flirtatious [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=652.32s)]
*  comments to Combs, where they would get involved with the planning and even the choosing of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=658.1600000000001s)]
*  which male escorts were going to be invited. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=663.36s)]
*  And I think that that really complicated the story that the government was trying to tell. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=667.36s)]
*  And that may have been the reason that the jury found him not guilty. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  The government's response was that these women were telling Diddy what he wanted to hear, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=677.48s)]
*  right, that they were in a scenario in which they felt they had to say they were happy [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=682.24s)]
*  about this, but they weren't really. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=686.88s)]
*  I mean, the women said that themselves. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=689.48s)]
*  They said, a lot of times I was only saying this because I knew that's what he wanted. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=691.36s)]
*  And if I didn't give it to him, he would get it somehow. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=696.72s)]
*  Or I would suffer or I was afraid that he would release those sex tapes that he had [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=700.24s)]
*  made of me. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=706.16s)]
*  So they did talk about their fear of consequences. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=707.28s)]
*  Some of those consequences that they fear was violence. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=712.12s)]
*  We heard a lot about that from Cassie. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=714.96s)]
*  And we even saw it on the hotel videotape that was broadcast on CNN. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=717.4s)]
*  That was a central piece of evidence in the trial that the jury saw again and again and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=722.4s)]
*  again. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=727.72s)]
*  And the defense's response was not to deny that it happened because it was on film, but [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=729.32s)]
*  to say, yes, he beat his girlfriend. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=735.8s)]
*  He was violent, but he wasn't a sex trafficker. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=738.68s)]
*  Do you think it's possible, Ben, that the government opened itself up to criticism for [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=742.64s)]
*  the strategy that it took in this case? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=750.0s)]
*  We talked on the show about how difficult racketeering would be to prove. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=752.88s)]
*  And I'm wondering if you think it's possible that the government's now vulnerable to critics [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=757.0999999999999s)]
*  who say maybe they shouldn't have brought those charges. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=761.56s)]
*  Maybe those more complex charges muddied their case. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=764.26s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=769.78s)]
*  I think they also may face criticism simply over the sex trafficking charge. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=770.78s)]
*  The defense portrayed the entire case as overreach. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=776.16s)]
*  And as the government looking to police behavior in the bedroom is the way that they would [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=780.9s)]
*  describe it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=786.9s)]
*  Their position was always that this was consensual sexual activity. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=787.98s)]
*  The counterpoint is that it was always going to be a difficult case for the government [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=794.16s)]
*  to prove. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=798.92s)]
*  And after the verdict was announced, the government released a statement where they basically [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=799.92s)]
*  defended their work and they talked about prosecuting sex crimes requires brave victims [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=805.3199999999999s)]
*  to come forward. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  And I read that as a signal to the victims that we're not giving up on you. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=813.2199999999999s)]
*  Basically saying these are really tough cases. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=819.0799999999999s)]
*  We stand by our strategy and we're still going to go forward with prosecutions like this. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=822.62s)]
*  That's how I read it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=828.68s)]
*  Ben, thank you so much for being here. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=830.32s)]
*  Thank you very much, Natalie. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=834.44s)]
*  After the break, I talked to my colleague, Jodie Cantor, about what this case may show [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=841.08s)]
*  about how prosecution of sexual assault claims has evolved in the aftermath of Me Too. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=845.8s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=862.3599999999999s)]
*  Jodie, you're one of the reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein story that sparked the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=867.36s)]
*  Me Too movement. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=877.16s)]
*  You've been following his case as it returned to court in New York for a retrial. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=878.16s)]
*  You've also just generally been a student of sexual assault litigation in the wake of [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=883.16s)]
*  Me Too. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=887.92s)]
*  So, I wanted to talk to you to help interpret this verdict. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=888.92s)]
*  How are you thinking about the outcome of this case, and particularly the fact that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=893.72s)]
*  Combs was found not guilty of sex trafficking? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=898.48s)]
*  Well, let's start here. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=901.88s)]
*  These are intimate crimes, right? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=904.24s)]
*  They occur behind closed doors. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=906.64s)]
*  They are often very hard to prove. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=909.58s)]
*  And it's also a premise of our legal system that we would rather have a guilty person [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=911.6800000000001s)]
*  walking around free than we would send an innocent person to prison. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=917.0600000000001s)]
*  So the starting assumption, I think, for most sex crime trials is that it's very hard to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=923.42s)]
*  convict. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=929.38s)]
*  But the question for the legal system in the wake of the Me Too movement has been, is it [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=930.38s)]
*  too hard? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=935.4599999999999s)]
*  Is the system so rigid that it can't recognize reality when a crime has taken place? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=936.4599999999999s)]
*  Can it not recognize what is sometimes the messy nature of these interactions and of [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=944.18s)]
*  women's lives? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=950.4599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=951.4599999999999s)]
*  One of the central questions that came in the aftermath of the Me Too movement seemed [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=952.5400000000001s)]
*  to be, how are all of these accusations that have been made in the public square, how do [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=956.4200000000001s)]
*  they translate to a court of law? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=961.62s)]
*  How are judges and juries going to handle the complexity and mushiness of cases that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=964.58s)]
*  hinge on questions of consent? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=970.1s)]
*  Totally. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=972.74s)]
*  So, here's a really messy thing that both the recent Weinstein trial in New York and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=973.74s)]
*  the Diddy trial have in common, which is that some of the women at the center of these [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=978.66s)]
*  cases acknowledged having had somewhat romantic, somewhat consensual relationships with the [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=983.1s)]
*  accused. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=991.18s)]
*  It is so hard for a jury of strangers to walk into one of these rooms, take a look at this [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=992.18s)]
*  very private thing that happened in the past, and say, ooh, you know, I can draw a clear [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=999.38s)]
*  line between what is consensual and what is non-consensual here. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1004.96s)]
*  Will a jury decisively, unanimously be willing to say, yes, this man is guilty? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1010.9200000000001s)]
*  And in the Diddy case, sent him to federal prison for a really long time based on a relationship [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1019.9200000000001s)]
*  that's hard to parse? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1028.04s)]
*  That was a problem for prosecutors in both trials. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1030.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1035.24s)]
*  And in this case, while we don't know everything that the jury was thinking, it seems clear [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1036.24s)]
*  that they felt unable to say definitively these two women didn't consent to these sexual [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1040.0s)]
*  encounters. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1045.6799999999998s)]
*  Like, the jury is saying, we're on the outside looking in, deciding if this was consensual [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1046.6799999999998s)]
*  or not. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1051.76s)]
*  I mean, making that kind of determination just has to be difficult, right? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1052.76s)]
*  It's really difficult. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1057.58s)]
*  Part of what prosecutors did in both cases is that they used somewhat creative techniques. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1060.0800000000002s)]
*  In the first Weinstein trial in New York, the one that was overturned, the prosecutors [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1065.28s)]
*  brought these other women in who were kind of pattern witnesses who testified about Weinstein's [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1071.44s)]
*  behavior towards them. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1079.52s)]
*  And it was both very effective in the courtroom and it was also the reason why the conviction [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1082.6000000000001s)]
*  was overturned by a very narrow margin because it struck some of the appellate judges as [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1087.8s)]
*  unfair. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1094.12s)]
*  There's like a bedrock principle in the legal world that you can only be tried for the thing [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1095.48s)]
*  you're being tried for. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1100.1599999999999s)]
*  Bringing in some other outside thing is unfair. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1102.08s)]
*  That became a problem for prosecutors with Weinstein. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1106.04s)]
*  With Diddy, what you see is this kind of creative prosecution that involves sex, trafficking, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1109.84s)]
*  charges, and racketeering, even though in so many ways, what this looks like is maybe [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1117.72s)]
*  a little more similar to a domestic violence case. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1125.48s)]
*  So we talked a second ago about how rigid the system is. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1129.52s)]
*  This is the prosecutor's attempt to make the system a little bit less rigid and find new [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1134.68s)]
*  ways of saying this behavior is criminal. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1140.8s)]
*  But as they're doing that, what you're telling us is that you kind of make what could be [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1144.56s)]
*  a straightforward charge into a much more complex case that may be harder to prove. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1149.6799999999998s)]
*  Look, these are both cases about extremely powerful men who are alleged to have used [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1156.36s)]
*  their power to victimize women. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1164.6799999999998s)]
*  And the criminal justice system doesn't have a straightforward way of measuring that. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1168.24s)]
*  And both of these cases involved the really difficult question of what exactly is coercion. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1174.5600000000002s)]
*  And prosecutors, in constructing these much more elaborate cases, which in this instance [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1181.8400000000001s)]
*  included racketeering, are trying, it seems, to illustrate that power, to map it out, to [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1187.3400000000001s)]
*  show how it works, they say, in service of these crimes. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1194.3600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1198.4s)]
*  They're trying to bring to legal life these terrible power dynamics that the women experienced. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1199.4s)]
*  And crucially, they're trying to say that these power dynamics aren't just unfortunate, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  but that they were deployed in a criminal way. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1211.5600000000002s)]
*  And that's not an argument we would have seen a generation or two ago. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1216.2s)]
*  It isn't that long ago that prosecutors really would not touch cases like this that involved [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1221.0400000000002s)]
*  consensual sex, because the conventional wisdom among prosecutors were that juries [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1227.12s)]
*  were just going to find it too messy. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1232.6s)]
*  And so that's why the kind of mixed results of these two cases are so interesting, right? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1237.36s)]
*  The juries did and didn't buy prosecutors' arguments. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1244.0s)]
*  In the Weinstein retrial, there are three women at the center of that trial. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1248.04s)]
*  With one of them, Weinstein was declared not guilty. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1253.48s)]
*  On another, the jurors couldn't come to agreement themselves, and that one was a mistrial. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1257.84s)]
*  And then on the third, he was convicted. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1264.64s)]
*  And then with Diddy, as we saw, he was convicted on these two kind of side dish charges that [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1267.72s)]
*  involved transportation for the purposes of prostitution. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1274.7s)]
*  So in both trials, you sort of get the sense that the message from the jury is, we're not [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1280.02s)]
*  cool about what happened. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1286.22s)]
*  There was some criminality here. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1289.06s)]
*  There's something seriously wrong. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1290.86s)]
*  But we are unwilling to go with the full force of the charges either. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1293.3799999999999s)]
*  What do you make of that, this mixed result? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1300.04s)]
*  In this case, also in the Weinstein case, what does that tell you? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1302.74s)]
*  It's funny, Natalie, I've spent years telling people, don't draw broad conclusions from [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1306.9s)]
*  one legal proceeding. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1313.26s)]
*  You can't judge the entire Me Too movement based on the performance of one jury or the [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1315.1000000000001s)]
*  outcome of one criminal trial. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1321.8000000000002s)]
*  However, I do think when we take the Weinstein saga and we add Diddy, we do have a decent [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1323.94s)]
*  barometer of how people are thinking now, right? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1331.46s)]
*  Because there is willingness to recognize the women's stories and to say that something [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1334.74s)]
*  was wrong. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1341.5s)]
*  There is a desire on the part of prosecutors to better reflect the reality of what women [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1342.9s)]
*  have experienced. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1350.32s)]
*  And yet there's also a lot of debate and reluctance. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1352.54s)]
*  And remember, juries require unanimity. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1356.42s)]
*  So given all the currents swirling around Me Too and these issues, good luck getting [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1359.58s)]
*  nine people to agree on them. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1365.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1367.3799999999999s)]
*  And Jodie, I think a lot of people are looking at this result in this case and saying, look, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1368.3799999999999s)]
*  this is a failure for prosecutors. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1374.26s)]
*  They didn't get a conviction on their two biggest charges. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1376.6999999999998s)]
*  And so I mean, I wonder if there is a kind of resounding message there. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1380.54s)]
*  You know, I wanted to know the answer to the question you're asking. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1385.86s)]
*  So earlier today, I called some of my most expert sources, former sex crimes, prosecutors [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1391.1s)]
*  who track this stuff very closely. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1396.6599999999999s)]
*  And what they said is that for prosecutors, they don't see this as an abject loss. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1399.7s)]
*  They are so happy that prosecutors brought this case in the first place, see it as a [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1406.3s)]
*  sign of progress and a kind of testing because prosecutors don't know what will work until [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1412.02s)]
*  they actually discover in court what will work. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1417.86s)]
*  The question now given these mixed results is what cues do the prosecutors take from [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1421.5s)]
*  this? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1428.54s)]
*  Do they say, oh, there is a little room to work here. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1429.54s)]
*  Things have changed. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1433.74s)]
*  These are more willing to believe very complicated stories told by women. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1435.86s)]
*  Or do they look at these results and say these prosecutors went too far? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1442.3799999999999s)]
*  Jodi, thanks so much. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1460.78s)]
*  Natalie, great to be with you. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1462.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1465.86s)]
*  On Wednesday evening, the judge presiding over the Sean Combs case denied the music [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1472.86s)]
*  mogul bail, citing his history of domestic violence. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1477.3799999999999s)]
*  Combs will remain in federal custody until his sentencing. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1482.1799999999998s)]
*  He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years for his two guilty charges. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1486.02s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1496.5s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1507.5s)]
*  On Wednesday night, House Republicans were locked in tense negotiations over the fate [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1511.3s)]
*  of President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1515.9799999999998s)]
*  Conservative Republicans have complained that the bill doesn't make deep enough cuts to [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1520.06s)]
*  federal spending, while moderate Republicans fear it makes too many cuts to the country's [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1524.26s)]
*  social safety net. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1529.3799999999999s)]
*  Trump can only afford for three House Republicans to vote against the bill, and he spent much [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1531.74s)]
*  of the day trying to persuade them to back the legislation. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1536.66s)]
*  White House officials predict that the bill will pass as soon as today. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1540.74s)]
*  And new data shows that the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico has dropped [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1546.58s)]
*  to the lowest level in decades. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1551.94s)]
*  The decrease highlights just how much President Trump's hard-line immigration policies are [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJvKLa2VX8&t=1554.8200000000002s)]
