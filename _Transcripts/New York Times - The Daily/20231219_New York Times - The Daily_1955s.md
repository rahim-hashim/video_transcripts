# Footballâ€™s Young Victims
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vOo6qIHJI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  They started playing football as young as six years old.
*  They died in their teens and twenties with CTE.
*  Today, my colleague John Branch, on the growing body of evidence that a disease many believed
*  was reserved for professional athletes, is also afflicting young amateurs.
*  It's Tuesday, December 19th.
*  John we wanted to talk to you because you have spent many years trying to understand
*  what's been happening to the brains of athletes who play contact sports.
*  And you have been talking to researchers who study those brains and those researchers recently
*  told you about a major new discovery.
*  So tell us about that.
*  So what we're talking about when we're talking about brain damage in contact sports athletes
*  is CTE, which stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
*  And what this is, it's the brain disease, progressive brain disease caused by concussions
*  and hits to the head.
*  And for the most part, CTE has been connected with, at least in terms of the public perception,
*  aging football players, Hall of Fame style football players, Ken Stabler, the Earl Morales,
*  people like Junior Seau.
*  There are now 300 and some former NFL players who have been posthumously diagnosed with
*  CTE.
*  But what's new now is that for the first time, these researchers have gathered this growing
*  subset of young brains, of young people, people under the age of 30 into a profound study.
*  And it shows, you know, things that we knew or suspected, but it puts it in very, in very
*  stark terms.
*  Young athletes, even teenagers, as young as 17 years old, are getting CTE and feeling
*  the effects of it.
*  And these researchers at Boston University have found cases of CTE in more than 60 brains
*  of young athletes who have died.
*  Some of them were really advanced cases.
*  Which is genuinely startling, right?
*  I mean, that would seem to completely change how we think about the very idea of CTE.
*  Yeah, I think where this changes the mindset for us is this is afflicting people who are
*  just in high school, who are maybe just in college, who had no aspirations to go to the
*  pros.
*  You know, these are people who, starting from a really young age, suffer the same kinds
*  of symptoms that we've seen in the pro players.
*  Things like memory loss and impulse control, insomnia.
*  They're having troubles with substance abuse and severe depression and sometimes ultimately
*  even suicide.
*  And once, John, you absorb this new research and the implications of it, what do you do
*  with all that?
*  We wanted to go talk to some of these families whose children had been part of this data
*  group.
*  You know, these are families who have watched their child decline for reasons they couldn't
*  explain.
*  And they now have information that tells them a little bit more about what might have been
*  behind those confusing years, all those signs that they couldn't make sense of.
*  And we wanted to understand how they processed that new information, knowing now what that
*  answer might be.
*  And which of those families stands out to you?
*  Well, there are several.
*  All right, well, thank you both.
*  But I would say that the family of Hunter Foraker.
*  Let's start chronologically.
*  His parents, Bill and Kim Foraker, still really stick with me.
*  In 1992, Hunter was born in May.
*  Why the name Hunter?
*  Bill came up with that name.
*  Bill, can you tell us why?
*  It was Colorado-y.
*  And as it turned out, it was perfect for him.
*  Hunter was a kid who grew up in Colorado.
*  And when I went to visit his parents, they really reminisced about how great his childhood
*  was.
*  We lived in the mountains.
*  We had a chocolate lab named Hershey.
*  And we hiked every day.
*  How much he loved the outdoors.
*  Fishing, hunting, skiing.
*  How much time they spent skiing and hiking and doing things up in the mountains.
*  Hunter was definitely a Colorado boy.
*  Yeah.
*  His parents described him as quiet, but also very mature, never a troublemaker.
*  And when he was seven years old, he began to play tackle football.
*  The name of the team was Cougars.
*  And Bill was the coach.
*  Yeah.
*  Go, Hunter!
*  Go, go, go, go!
*  His father Bill thought the best thing to do would be to coach my own child, to teach
*  him the game, to teach him how to play it safely.
*  Hmm.
*  Get him, get him, get him!
*  I was concerned if he was going to play a contact sport like football that I was there
*  to supervise.
*  Good job!
*  And so he coached his son all the way until his son got up to high school.
*  He was lights out.
*  He excelled.
*  I mean, at levels that they'd never seen before in a kid that young in high school.
*  He becomes a star at Mullen High School, which is one of the big powerhouse football programs
*  in Denver.
*  And sometime in his mid-teens.
*  Was it during his sophomore summer?
*  Yeah.
*  He ever sustained a concussion, a pretty serious concussion.
*  I never knew during the scrimmage.
*  I knew he was acting a little different, but nothing alarming.
*  He was woozy afterward.
*  Seemed to have shaken it off the way a lot of kids do.
*  But on the way home that day.
*  He started to vomit.
*  He threw up in the car.
*  The Four Acres then took him to the hospital and then to his pediatrician.
*  Looked him over and he said, Hunter, you're a big kid.
*  You're tough.
*  You got your bell rung.
*  Go get him.
*  You're going to be an All-American.
*  In other words, go back to the football field.
*  Go back to the football field.
*  And that's exactly what Hunter does.
*  He becomes the captain of the football team his junior and senior year.
*  That football team goes on to win a state title and Hunter is an All-State player.
*  But off the field there were some challenges.
*  Some of them felt like normal high school stuff to the Four Acres and some of them didn't.
*  Especially in hindsight.
*  There were some signs of him getting a bit of a temper.
*  He began to drink a little bit and a lot of kids do.
*  How big of a concern is it?
*  He was also having nightmares.
*  He had horrible nightmares.
*  And I asked him to please explain to me these nightmares.
*  And he said, they are so f-ing bad, I cannot begin to tell you what they are.
*  And so he started getting some therapy and they thought he was okay.
*  You know, he was doing well in school.
*  He was playing well in football.
*  But Hunter was not the type of person who thought he would ever go professional.
*  I think football to Hunter meant a way to a higher education.
*  You know, a lot of these kids, my dream of the NFL, that was not really his dream.
*  His dream was actually for the best education possible.
*  And so he saw football as potentially a useful tool to get him into a better school.
*  And he fell in love with Dartmouth.
*  And sure enough, that's where he went because Dartmouth and New Hampshire reminded him a
*  lot of Colorado with the mountains and the outdoor activities.
*  And what happens to Hunter once he gets to Dartmouth?
*  Yeah, so he plays on the JV team his freshman year and does very well.
*  And then during training campus sophomore year, he has another serious concussion.
*  And it took him about a week and a half to really fully recover.
*  He was foggy.
*  He would report serious headaches.
*  And he was really uncomfortable with the way concussions were handled.
*  Hunter told his parents he had seen some of his other teammates with concussions and saw
*  how they hurried back despite having symptoms.
*  And I remember having a conversation with him that it scared him to death that he's
*  witnessed other football players on his team that have had concussions and that he knows
*  it and they would just go right back in.
*  And he said, you know what, this is not for me.
*  This is not really the reason why I'm here.
*  I'm here to get an education.
*  And he quit football.
*  So he understood these hits he had been taking as accumulating to something that he no longer
*  wanted to be a part of.
*  That's right.
*  And what happens once he walks away?
*  Well, he continues there at Dartmouth.
*  He focuses on his studies and actually graduates with a double major in environmental science
*  and anthropology.
*  And he stays at Dartmouth to work for the alumni relations department.
*  From Bill and Kim's perspective, he seemed to be doing okay.
*  But there were some worrying signs.
*  Some of the issues that they had seen in previous years from him seemed to be intensifying.
*  He seemed to be drinking more and more.
*  His nightmares seemed to be getting worse.
*  He started to talk a little bit about loneliness and depression, which they accounted to the
*  fact that he was still at Dartmouth while most of his friends from the undergraduate
*  years had moved on.
*  And then they get a call.
*  And he said, Mom and Dad, I'm so sorry.
*  I really f'd up.
*  And we were like, what did you do?
*  Because this kid was never in trouble.
*  And he goes, well, I drank too much.
*  I ended up at Hitchcock.
*  Hunter was at Dartmouth Hitchcock Hospital.
*  And they told him he was an alcoholic.
*  That's where he first got labeled.
*  So he spent a year or so.
*  You know, rehab, detox, rehab, detox.
*  In and out of rehab and out of detox.
*  It was just the circle.
*  Drinking became a bigger and bigger problem.
*  I know the nightmares were horrible.
*  And he was just trying to survive.
*  I think that is part of the reason he was binge drinking was to get those thoughts out
*  of his mind.
*  What do his parents think is happening at this point?
*  How are they making sense of what he's going through?
*  Well, it's impossible, right?
*  Because they're trying to make sense of small clues, phone calls and notes, things they
*  hear.
*  You know, he's not living with them.
*  So it's hard for them to know.
*  At one point, Hunter told him that he had been diagnosed as bipolar and with depression
*  and anxiety.
*  And he had been given medications.
*  His weight had dropped by at least 50 pounds.
*  He was just skinny, no muscle tone, unshaven, unkept.
*  You know, those were alarming signs to us that something was wrong with him.
*  But at the time, we were still hearing from the professionals that he is an alcoholic.
*  And this must just be what happens to one's body.
*  And then they got a call one day, one winter, when they had not heard from him for a few
*  days and he was supposedly on a ski trip in Colorado and found out that Hunter had attempted
*  suicide.
*  He had tried to drink himself to death.
*  His intoxication level was the highest they had ever found a person to be.
*  And they could not believe that he was still alive.
*  And at that point, Hunter goes back into rehab and into counseling.
*  But after a few weeks, he seems to be better.
*  Things seem to be clicking for him.
*  He had cleaned up.
*  He was freshly shaven.
*  He had a nice haircut.
*  He had a new clothes that fit him nicely.
*  And we thought, oh, he's sober.
*  He's on the right track.
*  He put weight back on.
*  Yeah, he's turned a corner.
*  Just to kind of point out, you know, how this went back and forth and just as soon as you
*  think things are getting really dark, now you start to see the light and you start thinking
*  maybe he's moving forward.
*  Maybe this is a positive step here.
*  He actually got a job, a good job in Dallas.
*  And so Kim and the couple's daughter helped move Hunter into an apartment in Dallas.
*  He seemed so happy.
*  The old Hunter, he was just the old Hunter.
*  And we were thrilled for him.
*  They left there and went back home thinking Hunter's in a really good place.
*  Whatever all that was, he seems to have worked his way through it.
*  But a few days later, he stopped answering texts.
*  So Thursday, we tried to get a hold of him.
*  No answer.
*  Couldn't reach him.
*  Friday called him.
*  You know, hey, let's FaceTime.
*  Skype, texting, no answer.
*  And over the course of a weekend.
*  By Sunday, I was frantic.
*  Monday morning, over the top.
*  They couldn't get a hold of him and finally called the police to do a wellness check.
*  And finally, hours later, we get a call.
*  We get a call back.
*  And that was it.
*  That was it.
*  And they found that Hunter had shot himself.
*  That he had taken his own life.
*  Hmm.
*  The worst news you ever want to hear.
*  You know, the worst news you ever want to hear.
*  You've lost your child.
*  So after the police find Hunter, the local coroner goes to the apartment and notices
*  all the football helmets that Hunter has and calls the family and says, have you considered
*  donating your son's brain for research?
*  The coroner obviously understands there's a connection between football and brain disease.
*  And the Four Acre family would not consider this.
*  Turned around at that moment and said, yeah, yeah, we're desperate for answers.
*  We want to know what happened to Hunter.
*  And if this helps us understand it, then by all means, let's donate his brain.
*  So Hunter's brain ends up in Massachusetts at the same brain bank that has examined the
*  brains of all these famous football players.
*  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of brains.
*  And the researchers then call Kim and Bill and say, your son had stage two CTE out of
*  a four stage scale.
*  Severe case of CTE, especially for somebody that age.
*  And then we started asking questions, of course.
*  What exactly does that mean?
*  You know, what are the symptoms?
*  And then she started telling us and then it just came together and it was like that was
*  Hunter.
*  Exactly.
*  His actions, his change in his lifestyle, his everything, it just started coming together.
*  And so in some ways they were relieved.
*  They had an answer for what had happened to their son.
*  All these inexplicable things that he had been going through the last few years now
*  suddenly kind of made sense.
*  They could be explained in some way.
*  But it also struck them with a hard piece of guilt because they're the ones who put
*  them into football.
*  You know, how could we have let our child get harmed to that point?
*  How could we ever have let Hunter in a sport that damaged his brain to a point that gave
*  him stage two CTE?
*  I mean, that is something an NFL player has.
*  And I feel a tremendous amount of guilt because I was there coaching the whole time.
*  We'll be right back.
*  John, I want to better understand the research at the heart of this reporting that you have
*  been doing.
*  And you mentioned it briefly at the beginning of our conversation, the work of these researchers
*  at Boston University who've been studying the brains of people like Hunter Foraker.
*  So take us more deeply inside of that research and into its specific findings.
*  Yeah.
*  So this study is focused on brains of young athletes under the age of 30.
*  And since 2008, between 2008 and 2022, they collected 152 of them.
*  And what they have to do is to take them into a lab and they literally slice them into really
*  thin sheets and put them underneath the microscope.
*  And what they're looking for is the buildup of what they call tau proteins.
*  And what tau proteins do basically is tangle the neurons in the brains, not unlike what
*  we see with older people who have dementia or Alzheimer's.
*  So the researchers take a look at slices of the brains from the 152 samples that they
*  have of people under 30 years old.
*  And they find CTE in 63 of those brains.
*  A little bit more than 40% of them had CTE.
*  That's a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  It sounds like a staggering number.
*  And it's not just the brain that's going to be trying to optimize even the researchers.
*  Now we have to be clear that this is a biased sample.
*  People are donating these brains because they are looking for answers.
*  So it's a no way to suggest that 40% of kids who play football or anything else are going
*  to have CTE.
*  But yeah, more than 40% of the brains that they had, had CTE.
*  Among those are athletes who were as young as 17 years old, 18 year olds with very severe
*  cases of CTE, as bad as many of these NFL football players and hall of famers that we've
*  been talking about.
*  And it crosses a lot of sports.
*  We typically associate this with football.
*  And that's where most of these brains came from, where the families of football players.
*  But there were other sports as well.
*  Hockey, soccer, boxers, an equestrian athlete, rugby.
*  These are all contact sports that are now seeing increasing numbers of people with CTE,
*  including young people with CTE.
*  Something you just said seems a little hard to wrap your head around, which is that there
*  are cases where these young athletes have CTE that is as serious as professional athletes,
*  which is very counterintuitive.
*  I mean, even a young athlete who plays football for a long time doesn't evoke the kind of
*  hits that I think of when I think of professional football.
*  So how do the researchers come to understand that?
*  Yeah, I mean, this is all part of the nasty trick of trying to figure out what CTE is
*  and who gets it and why.
*  The researchers don't know why somebody is more apt to get it, why somebody is more apt
*  to get more severe cases of CTE.
*  Michael, you and I could have the same career.
*  You and I could play football through our youth and into the pros for 20 years.
*  I may have a severe case of CTE.
*  You show no signs whatsoever.
*  And part of the difficulty of this is that this does not just involve concussions that
*  we see on TV every Sunday where somebody is maybe knocked out and carted off the field.
*  CTE is the product of subconcussive hits as well.
*  And subconcussive hits are those hits that maybe don't even register to the person who's
*  absorbing them, certainly not to anybody else who's watching.
*  If you think about in the NFL or in football, the offensive linemen and defensive linemen
*  are banging heads every single play.
*  CTE, they believe, is basically the accumulation of the total force that you're taking.
*  That force can be in several big hits or it can be thousands of little ones.
*  And so what you're talking about with kids is when you're putting them into football
*  at the ages of six or seven, those hits add up.
*  So according to this theory about subconcussive hits, in the case of someone like Hunter,
*  what ultimately mattered to his CTE might not have been those two big concussions.
*  He suffered one in high school, one in college.
*  It may have been ultimately countless smaller hits he took over his career that he didn't
*  even notice all the way back to when he was in Pee-wee football.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I mean, his family knows of two big concussions.
*  They don't know if Hunter had a lot of other ones he never owned up to.
*  They don't know if he had a lot of ones that maybe he thought were just minor hits that
*  he felt and maybe made him feel weird for a day or two.
*  And they certainly don't know how many thousands and thousands or whatever the total might
*  be hits he took in every single practice from the age of seven through the first year or
*  second year at Dartmouth in college.
*  You know, that's 10 or 12 years or more of football and being hit in the head a lot of
*  times.
*  Well, given that reality, what do these researchers say about the overall safety of any version
*  of youth contact sport, especially football, but really any of the sports that we've been
*  talking about here?
*  Yeah, the researchers say essentially don't do it.
*  Are they that explicit?
*  Yeah.
*  I believe that, you know, look in this country, we're not going to stop the hits in the NFL.
*  And at this point, we're probably not going to stop them in college and maybe even in
*  high school and some of these communities that are, you know, worship tackle football.
*  But one thing they believe we can do is to stop letting kids from the ages of five or
*  six or seven or eight hit themselves in the head up until at least they're in high school.
*  So their recommendation is anybody under say the age of 14 or anybody before they get to
*  high school should not be playing tackle football.
*  If it really truly is an issue of number of years of exposure to hits, we know most
*  people are not going to go play in college.
*  Very few people are ever going to play in the pros.
*  So how much CTE could we eliminate by just eliminating them tackling when they're young?
*  Hmm.
*  In other words, limit the exposure to the four years of high school for most people,
*  which is a lot of years potentially of brain damage, but it's fewer than if a kid starts
*  when they're five or six.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I'm curious, are these recommendations, are they focused just on football or do they extend
*  to other youth contact sports?
*  There are now other sports that are certainly more aware of concussions and even sub concussive
*  hits and an example might be soccer, where a lot of the youth leagues now are banning
*  heading of the soccer ball because soccer players now have been shown to have CTE.
*  Well they're not hitting each other like football players on every play where they're getting
*  a lot of their hits are from just heading the ball and that's a sub concussive hit.
*  And now we know there might actually be long term ramifications to that.
*  Right.
*  John, you had mentioned that Hunter's parents, when they learned of his diagnosis of CTE,
*  looked back at his time as a player with a lot of guilt.
*  How have the parents of the other young athletes in this study who were also diagnosed with
*  CTE handled that news?
*  And what did they tell you about how they now think about football and what their kids
*  were doing?
*  Yeah, there are certainly a lot of families that are on board with the idea that young
*  kids should not play football, at least to a certain age, and they regret what they had
*  their kids do.
*  But not everybody.
*  In fact, we talked to a couple of families who are still deeply involved in football.
*  One of them who lost their son, the father is the head football coach at University of
*  Maryland.
*  He believes football does so many good things for kids that even though his own son had
*  CTE, he is still involved at the highest level of the game.
*  The 18 year old who had stage two, his parents say if they had it to do over again, he would
*  still play football.
*  That's going to be hard for some listeners to wrap their heads around the idea that a
*  parent whose kid is diagnosed with CTE posthumously doesn't regret them playing football and doesn't
*  want to discourage anybody else from playing football.
*  Yeah, I think for a lot of people, it seems simple, right?
*  But it's complicated.
*  And it's complicated for these families who are going through the worst thing that any
*  of us could ever imagine.
*  The tricky part of this is that CTE is, there's not a straight line between CTE and the ultimate
*  death of your child.
*  Some families will say, look, I know CTE maybe had some factors in the decline of my child,
*  but he was going through a lot.
*  There were some other mental health issues.
*  There were changes in his own life.
*  I can't draw a straight line between what happened to him and CTE.
*  And so I wouldn't want to take away what gave my son so much joy that for all those years
*  growing up, those were the best times in his life.
*  And if I can't necessarily say that that's exactly why he's not here anymore, then why
*  would I take that away?
*  There's something I think ultimately very sad about the way we got to this entire conversation,
*  John, which is, as you said, you can't diagnose CTE when somebody's alive.
*  The only way we get here is because so many young people suffered so much that many of
*  them took their own lives, donated their brains to these scientists in Boston.
*  Therefore, it feels like the only way we're going to keep getting a deeper understanding
*  of this is through the death of more and more young athletes.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, unfortunately, the brain banks are going to grow with the brains of young athletes.
*  I think it's just the fact that CTE is just mysterious enough and intangible enough that
*  people are able to sort of ignore it and think, you know what, it's probably not going to
*  happen to my kid and I'm not going to be the one that pulls him off the football field
*  because of some fear that is probably unrealistic.
*  But as we found out from these families, it is realistic and there is a cultural awareness
*  now that didn't used to exist, probably didn't exist 10 years ago, in that even kids today
*  and certainly families today increasingly are aware of concussion issues and CTE.
*  One of the families that we spent time with was the family of Wyatt Bramwell.
*  He took his life at the age of 18 and had stage two CTE, a very severe case of CTE,
*  the worst that he has seen in somebody so young.
*  Hello.
*  So what this is, this is me explaining what's wrong with me.
*  But moments before he took his own life, he recorded a video in his car explaining his
*  decision.
*  My head is pretty messed up and damaged.
*  To be sent to family and loved ones.
*  The voices and demons in my head just started to take over everything I wanted to do because
*  my life for the past four years has been living hell inside of my head.
*  And he says it's all because of football.
*  I took a lot of hits through football, a lot of hits through football, took a lot of concussions.
*  And all the concussions that he took, including the ones that he never told anybody about.
*  Dad, I know you're capable of doing this and I want you to do it.
*  His last request is to his father.
*  After my funeral, which will be an open casket, I want my brain donated to be studied.
*  I feel like it'll be closer for me and it'll be closer for you guys to know that maybe
*  why it suffered from brain damage.
*  Maybe that was the reason.
*  So do that for yourself.
*  I would like that to be done.
*  Basically, Wyatt was predicting his own CTE and he was absolutely right.
*  Well, John, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, Pope Francis gave priests permission to bless same-sex couples.
*  His boldest step yet to make the Roman Catholic Church more welcoming to LGBTQ Catholics.
*  It was a major about phase for the church, which has long argued that any official approval
*  of same-sex couples amounted to blessing a sin.
*  But the church stopped short of allowing priests to marry gay couples, which remains forbidden.
*  And the governor of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, has signed a law that permits Texas
*  police to arrest migrants who illegally enter the state from Mexico, setting up a legal
*  showdown with the federal government.
*  Abbott said that such arrests are needed to allow Texas to reduce illegal crossings into
*  the state, which exceeded 60,000 over the past year.
*  But according to Democrats and immigration activists, it would violate the U.S.
*  Constitution, which gives the federal government, not states, the power to enforce immigration law.
