# The Atlantic's Editor Jeffrey Goldberg on How He Was Texted Secret War Plans on Signal
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw)
*  Hey everybody, it's Sabrina. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been a little while, I know, and that's because after three years of hosting this [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=3.92s)]
*  show with Michael, I'm leaving the job as host. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  I've decided to return to my first love, Reporting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=10.64s)]
*  It was a really hard decision for me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  As you know, this is a very special show, and I'm really proud of the work I did on [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=17.76s)]
*  it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=21.36s)]
*  I said Reporting was my first love, but you are dear listeners, and the amazing thing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=22.72s)]
*  that is this show is my other one. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=27.56s)]
*  I always loved hearing from you, knowing you were out there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  So as you've probably noticed, there's been some new voices on the show as we figure out [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  who's going to permanently step in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=38.76s)]
*  And don't be surprised if I come back to visit as a guest or even to sit in as host. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=41.36s)]
*  Okay, here's today's show. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=46.84s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=50.8s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=53.32s)]
*  It's being called a reckless and devastating breach of national security. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=57.4s)]
*  Revelations that top Trump officials inadvertently shared secret U.S. military plans with a prominent [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=64.84s)]
*  journalist by mistakenly adding him to a group chat. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=70.24s)]
*  Today, Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg explains how he initially thought [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=74.24s)]
*  the messages were a scam, and now what he makes of the enormous fallout since going [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=79.96s)]
*  public. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=85.32s)]
*  It's Wednesday, March 26. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=86.32s)]
*  Jeffrey is that you? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, hello, Jeffrey. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  You've had quite a week. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  It's only Tuesday morning. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, tell me what we're doing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=112.24s)]
*  What is this for? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=114.6s)]
*  So I'm with The Daily. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=115.88s)]
*  My name is Rachel Abrams. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=117.28s)]
*  Oh, The Daily. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=118.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=119.28s)]
*  I'm familiar with it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=120.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=121.28s)]
*  It's a little podcast at the New York Times. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=122.28s)]
*  Local newspaper in New York. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  No, we're just starting out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  So thanks for bearing with us. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  No, that's great. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=128.64s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=129.64s)]
*  Do you have a lot of listeners? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=130.64s)]
*  Yeah, we have a lot of listeners. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=131.64s)]
*  I'm happy to have my mom, my dad. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=132.64s)]
*  And my mom. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=135.64s)]
*  Jeffrey and I talked on Tuesday morning. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=136.64s)]
*  It was a full day after a story came out about how he'd been added accidentally to a group [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=141.72s)]
*  chat with top Trump administration officials. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=146.2s)]
*  So Jeffrey, we have never met before, but yesterday I think I texted you, I emailed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=152.28s)]
*  you, I called you, I called your publicist. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=157.68s)]
*  I was desperate to get you on the show to talk about your story and the reaction to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=159.88s)]
*  it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  Should have tried Signal. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  Should have tried Signal, that's right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  So as we're hinting at, you just wrote something that really everybody is talking about. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=168.48s)]
*  So tell us, where does the story begin? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=172.64s)]
*  The story begins in earnest about March 11th. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=176.32s)]
*  I received a message request on Signal from someone identified as Michael Waltz. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  He's the National Security Advisor of the United States. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=186.32s)]
*  Signal the secure messaging app. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, the commercial, non-government, end-to-end encrypted app that a lot of people in journalism [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  and outside of journalism use because it's allegedly safer. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=196.12s)]
*  And I don't know Waltz, I've met him a couple of times, but it struck me as unusual because [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=200.0s)]
*  I have a somewhat contentious relationship with the Trump administration, or more to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=204.44s)]
*  the point with Trump. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=209.16s)]
*  But certainly in the normal bandwidth of Washington experience for a magazine editor covers politics [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  and foreign policy and national security to get a message request from the National Security [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=216.64s)]
*  Advisor, if it was indeed him. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  I accepted the request, forgot about it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=222.04s)]
*  A couple of days later, I'm included in a group called the Houthi PC Small Group. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  Can you translate that for us? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=231.44s)]
*  You have deep experience in foreign policy as a journalist, as you've said. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  What does Houthi's PC Small Group mean to you in this moment? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=236.33999999999997s)]
*  Houthis are obviously the Iran-backed terrorist organization that runs part of Yemen and been [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=239.92s)]
*  obviously attacking shipping, attacking Israel for the last year and a half, becoming quite [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=245.44s)]
*  a menace to international shipping. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=250.62s)]
*  PC stands for Principles Committee, meaning that small group of principals, cabinet members, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=252.72s)]
*  people who run intelligence agencies. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=259.32s)]
*  And you are certainly, I think we need to point out, not a principal in this context. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=261.72s)]
*  No, I have never been to a principals meeting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=265.6s)]
*  Right, just to be clear. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=269.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=271.52s)]
*  So that's what PC stands for. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=272.68s)]
*  Small group is not actually that small, it was 18 people, 19 people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=274.24s)]
*  I wouldn't consider that a small group. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=279.04s)]
*  I would consider it the medium group. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=280.84s)]
*  And who is in the group at this point? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=283.32s)]
*  JD Vance, Michael Waltz, and the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury, CIA Director, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=285.4s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence, et cetera. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean, again, people who are identified as such on my phone, but I'm an appropriately [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  suspicious journalist. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=300.55999999999995s)]
*  And obviously for reasons I can go into, I think this is a setup of some sort. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=302.12s)]
*  I think this is a hoax, a deception, a non-state actor trying to entrap a journalist. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  I don't know what it is, but on the face premise of this is ridiculous, so it had to be something [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=310.64s)]
*  other than what it was purporting to be. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=316.84s)]
*  Right, basically like you being on a group chat with really top tier officials in the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=319.4s)]
*  administration, you're not believing this is the real thing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=323.32s)]
*  Maybe I can be included on something having to do with the Easter egg roll or something [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=326.68s)]
*  at the White House, but I'm not going to be in this. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=330.32s)]
*  And even though you think it's fake at this point, I'm sure you're still kind of curious, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  you're watching this thing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=339.2s)]
*  Because what if? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  What if? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, let's be honest, you become a journalist because the most interesting place on the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  planet is the other side of a closed door, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=347.72s)]
*  I got to watch it one way or the other. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  So what do they start discussing? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=354.04s)]
*  Well, the first text in this chain is from Michael Waltz saying that he's setting up [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=356.32s)]
*  this discussion group. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=361.36s)]
*  This is on a Thursday, I guess, for basically, you know, we're heading into this weekend. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=363.7s)]
*  There's this sort of elliptical promise of something happening over the next 72 hours. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  And Michael Waltz user name asks these other principals to give their weekend POC point [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=374.62s)]
*  of contact in case there's a reason to have a further discussion. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=382.14s)]
*  And so one after another, six or seven people respond, Marco Rubio or the person playing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=386.82s)]
*  Marco Rubio responds with a name from somebody from the State Department and so on, the Defense [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=391.14s)]
*  Department, et cetera. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=396.06s)]
*  And most interesting in this moment to me is that the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=397.54s)]
*  names a person and says this person is going to be representing the CIA in this discussion. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=404.1s)]
*  Now, what I learned over time is that the person he names is an active CIA officer whose [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=410.86s)]
*  name has never been discussed in public. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=416.82s)]
*  I thought, like, this is really weird. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=420.5s)]
*  What is happening here? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=425.5s)]
*  But that's the initial foray. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=426.58000000000004s)]
*  And then the next day, there's a really interesting substantive policy debate about whether the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=428.3s)]
*  US should ramp up its military activities against the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=435.42s)]
*  And there's a lot of criticism in the chain of the Biden administration's inability to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=441.62s)]
*  get the Houthi situation under control. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=446.14s)]
*  And really what there is is a lot of resentment expressed toward the Europeans for not being [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=449.02000000000004s)]
*  able to float navies that could actually do this work and criticism the Europeans for [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=452.78000000000003s)]
*  not being able to pay, you know, the sort of thing that we've heard for a while from [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=457.66s)]
*  these guys. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=461.06s)]
*  And JD Vance starts the conversation out by saying he disagrees with the decision to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  attack Yemen, at least right now. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=467.26s)]
*  He goes on to say that we're sending the wrong message to Europe and why do we have to do [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  this and to the European shipping that's in danger, not American shipping. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=473.1s)]
*  Furthermore, the president doesn't really understand the consequences of doing this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=477.62s)]
*  And JD Vance is, he's doing this in front of half the cabinet, people who work for the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=483.26s)]
*  president, he's telling them, I disagree with the president and also I'm not sure he gets [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=492.65999999999997s)]
*  And JD Vance is playing the role that we understand JD Vance to play, which is like kind of a [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  soft isolationism. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=499.58s)]
*  It's like, why are we fighting Yemen? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  And then the more kind of traditional muscular interventionist philosophy is represented [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=505.38s)]
*  by Michael Waltz, the national security advisor and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=511.82s)]
*  is yes, we recognize that Europe is pathetic. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=516.62s)]
*  And this is what Hegseth says about Europe in all caps, by the way. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=519.42s)]
*  They recognize this European dynamic, but they're more interested in just like, let's [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=523.78s)]
*  get this thing going against the Houthis. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=528.26s)]
*  So this conversation, just to recap, is them discussing whether ramping up attacks on the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=531.46s)]
*  Houthis militarily will be a good political strategy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=536.0600000000001s)]
*  And you're telling it sounds like they're having a kind of a polite disagreement. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=539.9000000000001s)]
*  JD Vance is seemingly disagreeing with the position that Trump has. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=544.02s)]
*  And that disagreement seems like it hinges on whether or not we're making the Europeans [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=548.22s)]
*  pay enough, which is something we've talked about on the show quite a bit. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=553.52s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=557.1s)]
*  So I want to check in with you here because in this moment, do you still think that this [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=558.9s)]
*  is a hoax? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=563.5799999999999s)]
*  Are you starting to sense that it could be real? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=564.5799999999999s)]
*  I am suspecting that it could be real because it's pretty accurate depiction of what these [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=567.38s)]
*  guys sound like. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=574.3s)]
*  But again, and let me put this in like, it can't be true. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=575.98s)]
*  That's what's keeping me from believing that it's true. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=581.86s)]
*  It can't be true. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=583.42s)]
*  It can't be true. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=584.42s)]
*  Like, come on. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=585.42s)]
*  I've been around this world for a long time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=586.9399999999999s)]
*  They don't do this. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=589.4599999999999s)]
*  No, Bob Woodward has spent an entire career trying to infiltrate groups like this. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=591.14s)]
*  So how could you possibly have just been added to a group chat? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=597.42s)]
*  And also, it's weird that substantive government conversations will be taking place over Signal [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=598.9s)]
*  because Signal is not, by the US government standards, secure. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=605.66s)]
*  In part because obviously it's open to, technically open to anyone, including yours truly. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=610.02s)]
*  I know that previous administrations have used different messaging services, but not [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=616.3399999999999s)]
*  for substance. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=624.26s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=625.26s)]
*  I mean, I think in the Biden administration, it's a good example. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=626.26s)]
*  They used Signal. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=629.4599999999999s)]
*  But my impression is, based on some reporting, my impression is that they use Signal to do [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=630.9s)]
*  things like setting up lunch appointments or, hey, I've just left Saudi Arabia. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=636.2199999999999s)]
*  I'll call you from a skiff when I get to whatever. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=641.02s)]
*  And just to be clear, the skiff is a? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=643.86s)]
*  The skiff is a compartmentalized facility that is built to protect conversations electronically. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=646.26s)]
*  You can't even take your phone or your Apple Watch or your Fitbit. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=653.62s)]
*  These are very, very, very secure facilities. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=658.42s)]
*  And by the way, the senior people in the national security apparatus of the United States have [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=661.58s)]
*  these things built into their houses when they're serving. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=667.1s)]
*  So they can just go down to the basement and make the secure phone call. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=670.86s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=674.78s)]
*  And the whole idea is to protect these conversations from foreign surveillance. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=675.78s)]
*  So what happens after this? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=681.98s)]
*  How does this discussion progress from here? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=683.64s)]
*  Well, it progressed very quickly so that on Saturday the 15th, I am running some errands [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=685.58s)]
*  and the Signal chat lights up. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=691.48s)]
*  And probably the most important text in this entire series of texts comes from the account [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=694.62s)]
*  user Pete Hegseth, who provides what I would call basically the attack sequence, a summary [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=700.34s)]
*  of the war plan. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=706.5799999999999s)]
*  And it's detailed. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=708.34s)]
*  It tells the exact time that attack will be launched. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=712.0799999999999s)]
*  It tells the exact time the effects of the attack will be felt in Yemen. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=715.62s)]
*  It talks about the weapons packages being used. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=720.02s)]
*  It talks about some specific targets. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=722.5799999999999s)]
*  Like actual military planning that is a settled business and about to happen. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=725.62s)]
*  A forthcoming attack on Yemen. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=729.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm also sitting there in my car. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=733.0600000000001s)]
*  It's 1144 a.m. Eastern Time. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=735.3000000000001s)]
*  I get this text. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=737.1800000000001s)]
*  The text promises that the effects of the first wave of attacks will be felt in Yemen [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=739.14s)]
*  at 1345, 1 45 p.m. Eastern Time. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=745.5200000000001s)]
*  So it's two hours. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=749.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=750.5s)]
*  And I'm thinking to myself, hmm, well, I guess in two hours I'm going to find out if this [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=751.5s)]
*  is a real chain or not. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=755.5400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=757.82s)]
*  So, you know, I basically just kind of sit there and at 1 55 or so I go into Twitter [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=759.6600000000001s)]
*  and I put Yemen in the search bar and then sure enough, there are bombs falling all over [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=768.6600000000001s)]
*  Yemen just as the user identified as Pete Hegseth promised two hours earlier. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=774.0600000000001s)]
*  Breaking news overseas right now. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=784.62s)]
*  Where officials are confirming that U.S. air and naval assets hit dozens of Houthi targets [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=785.98s)]
*  in Yemen, including missiles, radar, drones and air defense systems. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=791.02s)]
*  These are the most significant airstrikes since President Trump returned to the White [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=795.14s)]
*  House and the first time U.S. jets have struck these Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=798.9s)]
*  since President Trump returned to the White House. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=804.3000000000001s)]
*  Trump announced the strikes on social media threatening the Houthi rebels with, quote, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=806.7s)]
*  overwhelming lethal force. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=811.74s)]
*  The U.S. says it will keep attacking targets in Yemen until the Houthis stop their assault [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=813.94s)]
*  on global shipping in the Red Sea. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=818.22s)]
*  I want you to describe to us what you're seeing in this group chat after the attacks start. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=825.82s)]
*  It's a couple of updates on the consequences of the attack, that's all I'll say. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=829.9000000000001s)]
*  The damage that they think that they have done combined with some congratulatory texts. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=836.62s)]
*  And this is of course where they start using emojis. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=845.02s)]
*  Emojis? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=847.74s)]
*  Which emojis are they using? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=848.74s)]
*  Before the attack started, there was the prayer emoji used by a couple of people. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=849.74s)]
*  And then during the attacks, when the reports are coming in that's going well from the American [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=854.26s)]
*  perspective, there's the flex bicep, I guess, emoji. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=859.02s)]
*  There's the fire emoji. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=863.54s)]
*  There's an American flag emoji. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=865.3s)]
*  Sometimes they repeat it a couple of times. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=867.54s)]
*  And there I'm sitting there watching that and going, wow, every workplace is the same, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=870.14s)]
*  huh? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=875.06s)]
*  So what do you do next? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=876.06s)]
*  So I'm sitting in the car, I'm watching the Signal Chat react to the Yemen attack. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=877.3s)]
*  I'm realizing that this is almost certainly a real signal group and not some sort of deceptive [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=882.18s)]
*  disinformation campaign. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=888.8199999999999s)]
*  And so then I had to begin to make a series of decisions consulting with colleagues that [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=890.74s)]
*  ultimately led me to remove myself from the signal group later that day. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=896.78s)]
*  Knowing that the group administrator and signal and the members, I believe, of a group as [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=901.86s)]
*  well are notified that you have left the group. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=907.74s)]
*  I assumed at that point that Mike Walz was going to call and say, hey, who is this? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=912.5s)]
*  Or call and say, why did you leave the group? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=920.62s)]
*  And then I would say, Director Walz or whatever, do you even know who this is? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=923.38s)]
*  But nobody, look, here's the truth of it is nobody noticed when I was added and nobody [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=928.62s)]
*  noticed when I was left. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=934.18s)]
*  And can you tell us why you decided to leave the group chat? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=935.5s)]
*  I think people can make their own deductions here. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=938.82s)]
*  But I can't get into, for various reasons, the conversations I subsequently had with [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=942.54s)]
*  and others about my decision making. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=947.9s)]
*  All I will say is that I remove myself from the group, understanding the consequences [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=951.78s)]
*  of that. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=955.5400000000001s)]
*  And what I do is I decide, oh, I have to write a story about the world's weirdest signal [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=956.78s)]
*  group. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=962.34s)]
*  On Monday, I texted and emailed the relevant people in the chat. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=963.34s)]
*  I used the signal contact. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=969.14s)]
*  I sent long emails to a large number of players in this drama asking various questions. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=971.5799999999999s)]
*  And what was the response? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=979.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, I got one official response back from the National Security Council, which [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=980.5799999999999s)]
*  came pretty quickly saying, apparently, this is a real chain and we're investigating why [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=985.66s)]
*  a journalist was inadvertently invited to the chain. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=990.9s)]
*  But I think they had to acknowledge it and they did. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=995.14s)]
*  Once they acknowledged that it's real, I published our first piece on the subject. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=997.98s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1016.14s)]
*  You reacted to the story, The Atlantic, that said that some of your top cabinet officials [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1027.98s)]
*  and aides have been discussing very sensitive material through signal and included an Atlantic [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1033.34s)]
*  report in that. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1038.74s)]
*  What is your response to that? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1039.74s)]
*  And are you continuing to ask? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1040.74s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1041.74s)]
*  I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1042.74s)]
*  To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1044.54s)]
*  You're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who's made [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1046.9s)]
*  a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1054.28s)]
*  I just can't, to this moment, get over the idea that during the days that group was going [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1061.8s)]
*  on, not one of the participants said, we shouldn't be doing this on signal. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you believe that this warrants a congressional investigation? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1073.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, it will. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1076.32s)]
*  Common Sense says this was a major screw up and somebody should be held accountable. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1078.24s)]
*  Clearly, I think the administration has acknowledged it was a mistake and they'll tighten up and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1081.56s)]
*  make sure it doesn't happen again. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1085.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what else you can say about that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1086.3999999999999s)]
*  Should Mike Walton accept being disciplined? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1087.3999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  Jeffrey, I want to talk about the immediate reaction. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  This is such a breach of security protocols. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1101.08s)]
*  Can you explain the hazards of this from a security point of view? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1104.24s)]
*  Put aside the weirdness of inviting a journalist by mistake. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1109.92s)]
*  It's hard to put aside, obviously, given what's happened. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1114.04s)]
*  One of the things that people don't understand, I think, about why there are rules governing [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1117.92s)]
*  privileged conversations within the national security community is that signal might be [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1122.92s)]
*  end-to-end encrypted and it might be very hard to hack, but foreign intelligence services [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1127.36s)]
*  spend a lot of time trying to target the actual devices that belong to government officials. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1133.2s)]
*  In other words, the Secretary of State Marco Rubio is walking around with a cell phone [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1141.8s)]
*  in his pocket. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1145.0800000000002s)]
*  It should not surprise anyone to know that the Chinese government is very interested [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1146.68s)]
*  in knowing what's going on inside that phone and it uses all kinds of methods where, in [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1151.56s)]
*  a remote way, you can target that phone. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1156.8s)]
*  In this particular scenario, this particular attack on the Houthis, if a foreign adversary [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1160.0s)]
*  had gotten this information that you saw, what is the worst-case scenario? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1163.88s)]
*  Can you just play out the possibilities a little bit? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1168.4s)]
*  If somehow the Houthis understood that American warplanes were heading in their direction, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1170.88s)]
*  that would give them conceivably more time to prepare a response, which would obviously [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1177.56s)]
*  put the pilots of those planes in danger. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1182.72s)]
*  You're the National Security Advisor of the United States. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1186.08s)]
*  You're the CIA Director. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1188.0s)]
*  You don't want your target in Yemen to know that in an hour or so, he's going to get [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1189.84s)]
*  blown up. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1197.6399999999999s)]
*  So yes, if you put this stuff out in the wild and signal and you're not talking about this [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  in a secure way, face-to-face, theoretically, the danger level goes up. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1205.28s)]
*  This is so obvious to me. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1213.04s)]
*  Logic dictates this. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1214.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1215.6s)]
*  I just don't want to breeze over it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1216.6s)]
*  I just want to make it really clear for people that the reason that it is important for the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1218.6s)]
*  government to take all of these precautions and conceal these types of plans is that this [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1220.6s)]
*  information getting out there could compromise a military mission. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1225.1599999999999s)]
*  It could put military service members at risk. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1227.76s)]
*  A greater risk. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1230.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1231.76s)]
*  A greater risk. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1232.76s)]
*  Those are the stakes here. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1233.76s)]
*  Also, the success and failure of your mission, right? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1234.76s)]
*  Right, of course. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1237.0s)]
*  Because these are the stakes, did they break any laws here? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1238.48s)]
*  We're talking about how things are typically done, but did the existence of this group [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1242.24s)]
*  chat adding you with any of this illegal? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1245.56s)]
*  I can't answer that question. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1248.56s)]
*  I'm not a national security lawyer. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1249.56s)]
*  We've interviewed national security lawyers who say that there are various risks associated [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1251.48s)]
*  with doing this the way they did it. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1256.24s)]
*  That will be discovered in the fullness of time. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1258.56s)]
*  And there's a lot of chatter right now in military forums and government forums of people [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1261.16s)]
*  who are saying, I'm an army captain in the artillery, right? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1267.4s)]
*  But every year I have to be recertified in cybersecurity and I have to watch videos of [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1271.48s)]
*  how to make sure that your information is correct and what kind of information can you [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1278.52s)]
*  put on your personal phone and what kind of information can't you put on your personal [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1281.64s)]
*  phone. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1284.72s)]
*  And there are people who get kicked out of the military. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1285.72s)]
*  There are people who go to prison for compromising security at a much lower level than we're [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1288.3s)]
*  about to attack Yemen. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1294.32s)]
*  Here's how the attack is going to go. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1296.6s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1298.32s)]
*  So I can imagine that if you are a member of the military or the State Department, you [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1299.56s)]
*  are frustrated, to say the least. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1303.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what you're, because you are held to a very, very high standard that these folks, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1305.6399999999999s)]
*  at least for now, do not seem like they were holding themselves to. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1308.96s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1312.96s)]
*  And that's why there was no sympathy among government employees. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1313.96s)]
*  There's no particular sympathy for Hillary Clinton for having government emails on her [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1316.4399999999998s)]
*  personal server. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1321.6399999999999s)]
*  But still, there's not, you know, guys, you make these rules, you got to follow them. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1323.12s)]
*  Is there any chance that anybody on this group chat could believably say that they [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1327.8s)]
*  didn't know that they were supposed to take different kinds of precautions? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1333.56s)]
*  I mean, I guess you could say that. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1336.76s)]
*  It's the beginning of an administration. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1338.28s)]
*  They're two months in. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1340.1599999999999s)]
*  But is ignorance of the law, you know, does that absolve you of following the rules? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1341.2s)]
*  Although some of them have obviously served, Marco Rubio was on the Intelligence Committee, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1345.52s)]
*  John Ratcliffe was the former DNI, Pete Hexeth served in the Army, and so on. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1348.96s)]
*  Also, like, here's the thing. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1354.12s)]
*  I mean, even at that level, there's a kind of an orientation moment. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1355.56s)]
*  Here's your office. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1359.52s)]
*  Here's your computer. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1360.8s)]
*  Here's your skiff. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1362.0s)]
*  Here's your skiff. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1363.0s)]
*  This is the computer that you can communicate with other intelligence agencies with, but [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1364.0s)]
*  you cannot have your personal email on it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1368.68s)]
*  It's a closed system. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1370.84s)]
*  And this is the computer that you get to use to do internet research. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1372.44s)]
*  And this is the, you know, I mean, you're presumably told all this stuff. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1376.12s)]
*  It really makes you wonder what else is being communicated this way. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1380.12s)]
*  How many other small groups are there? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1385.2s)]
*  And also, why would these folks be communicating this way? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1386.72s)]
*  I mean, just... [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1390.04s)]
*  You know why? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1391.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1392.04s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1393.04s)]
*  Because going into a skiff is a pain in the neck. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1394.04s)]
*  Even if it's in your basement? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1395.88s)]
*  I mean, I had to go to the supermarket. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1397.04s)]
*  Maybe they got to go to the supermarket. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1398.64s)]
*  I mean, you know, you got to go to the supermarket. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1399.64s)]
*  You got to go take your kid to Little League. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1401.8s)]
*  I mean, all these people do have security details. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1404.44s)]
*  Mind you, they're driven and armored suburbans, and they have very extensive communications [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1407.88s)]
*  devices associated with those vehicles. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1413.76s)]
*  I mean, the idea is to make it maximally convenient. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1416.3600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, this is... [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1419.0s)]
*  So that's it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1420.0s)]
*  It's convenience. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1421.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1422.0s)]
*  Or, if you talk about it on Signal, you're obligated to make a copy of that discussion [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1423.0s)]
*  and send it to an official government account so that it can be archived by the National [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1430.16s)]
*  Archives. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1434.92s)]
*  But, Signal is a disappearing app. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1435.92s)]
*  Obviously, you know, the messages disappear. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1438.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, they can. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1440.04s)]
*  You can set it to disappear. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1441.04s)]
*  Is that what happened here? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1442.08s)]
*  Yeah, and these were set to disappear. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1443.24s)]
*  I see. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1444.24s)]
*  And so there is the plausible explanation that they're like, we just want to have real [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1445.24s)]
*  talk and we don't want this to be archived forever in the National Archives. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1449.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1454.1999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1455.1999999999998s)]
*  So that sounds like it potentially could be a legal problem. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1456.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, so it's convenience and also a way of having a way of protecting your conversation [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1457.1999999999998s)]
*  from future congressional oversight. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1462.52s)]
*  It's a lot of other things. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1465.6799999999998s)]
*  I think the natural question is to say under normal circumstances, there would probably [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1467.1599999999999s)]
*  be an investigation led by Congress. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1471.52s)]
*  Democrats are obviously calling for that, but it just feels like there must be so little [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1474.08s)]
*  interest in an investigation from anybody with the power to do it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1478.16s)]
*  And I just want to give you some examples of the reaction to your story that make me [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1482.1200000000001s)]
*  say that because over the past 24 hours, the Republicans have really played this down. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1486.38s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson has said, this is not our issue. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1491.8s)]
*  Senator John Kennedy said a mistake was made. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1494.72s)]
*  It happens. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1496.72s)]
*  A House Republican called it a learning moment. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1497.72s)]
*  Trump himself said, Mike Walt is a good man. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1499.92s)]
*  He's learned a lesson. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1502.64s)]
*  Do you think there will be any consequences for the people who initiated or participated [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1504.3600000000001s)]
*  in this breach of national security? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1509.72s)]
*  Nothing that's been said by the administration so far suggests to me that they're treating [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1513.5600000000002s)]
*  this seriously or treating it the way they would treat it if this were Democrats who [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1518.48s)]
*  had done this. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1523.1200000000001s)]
*  You mentioned Hillary Clinton earlier, but I want to bring it back to her for a second [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1524.44s)]
*  because it seems noteworthy that a lot of the people on this signal chat and certainly [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1527.24s)]
*  President Trump, all of these people made a very big deal about Clinton and how she [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1533.0s)]
*  used a private email server for official business when she was Secretary of State. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1537.8s)]
*  Everybody remembers the chance to lock her up. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1541.76s)]
*  And every turn, they described what she did as a very serious breach of national security [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1544.04s)]
*  that should face consequences. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1549.88s)]
*  And I just, can you for a second, putting aside whether or not this is hypocritical, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1551.48s)]
*  could you ruminate on whether you think what you have seen is as serious, more serious, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1556.66s)]
*  far more serious just by comparison to what she did? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1563.3400000000001s)]
*  If this is not a big deal, then people like Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio and all the rest [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1566.44s)]
*  have to go back into time and say that Hillary Clinton wasn't a big deal either. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1571.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1575.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is this kind of arid, dispiriting Washington game where when you commit a crime, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1576.1000000000001s)]
*  it's the worst thing that ever happened on the planet. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1584.0s)]
*  And when I do it, it's perfectly acceptable and understandable. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1585.82s)]
*  Here's the thing, and this is sort of what I would love to say to Pete Hegseth. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1589.06s)]
*  Six months ago, if Tony Blinken and Jake Sullivan and Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State, the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1594.14s)]
*  National Security Advisor and the Secretary of Defense and the Joe Biden administration, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1600.34s)]
*  were communicating with Kamala Harris over Signal about an imminent military attack and [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1604.26s)]
*  describing to Kamala Harris which weapons are going to be used in the attack. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1610.66s)]
*  And they mistakenly included a journalist in that conversation. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1616.7s)]
*  Do you really think Pete Hegseth would say it's not a big deal? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1622.1000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that they think that the mistake here is being accidentally included in this [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1625.6200000000001s)]
*  getting out or having used Signal in the first place? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1630.22s)]
*  What I understand from inside the White House, I've talked to a couple of people and obviously [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1633.22s)]
*  read some of the reporting in the last period of time. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1636.3s)]
*  They think that Mike Waltz is a dope for including me in the chat and they're really focused [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1639.1s)]
*  on that. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1645.14s)]
*  I mean, there's not a fantastic record of Democrats being completely assiduous about [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1646.14s)]
*  the storage and safekeeping of classified information. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1652.02s)]
*  I mean, nobody's perfect here, but we're coming out of a situation where the current [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1655.26s)]
*  actually indicted for hiding classified information in a bathroom. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1660.74s)]
*  This is the president, of course, who is known to have discussed classified operations on [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1667.6599999999999s)]
*  the veranda of Mar-a-Lago. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1673.3s)]
*  So the tone is set from the top. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1676.1399999999999s)]
*  There are people who take security very seriously and there are people who don't take it very [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1679.2199999999998s)]
*  seriously. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1684.4599999999998s)]
*  I don't think anybody would say that Donald Trump is one of those presidents who took [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1685.4599999999998s)]
*  it extremely seriously. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1688.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1689.68s)]
*  I think this sort of speaks to the question I asked you about whether you think there [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1690.68s)]
*  are going to be any consequences because like all of the examples you just laid out, those [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1692.44s)]
*  suggest that maybe these are folks that think the mistake here was most likely just including [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1696.64s)]
*  you, which makes me wonder, do you think that you are going to be now targeted by the administration? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1702.3600000000001s)]
*  And I just want to quote from Pete Hegseth here because immediately after your story came [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1708.28s)]
*  out, he denied that he had shared war plans. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1711.92s)]
*  He said that you yourself were a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1714.88s)]
*  who made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1720.8400000000001s)]
*  And just given how aggressive this administration has been toward the press generally, I just [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1724.5200000000002s)]
*  wonder if you think you might be the only one, ironically, that could face any punishment [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1729.8400000000001s)]
*  from this. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1734.5200000000002s)]
*  Well, I don't think about that. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1735.5200000000002s)]
*  By the way, those are words that hurt. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1738.0s)]
*  I'm really sorry that he said that. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1739.8000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump has called me terrible things for five years. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1742.08s)]
*  Just a few months ago, he called me a radical left disgraceful, something I can't even remember. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1745.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like a bunch of words, the usual words that he uses when he's mad at a reporter. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1752.8s)]
*  So A, I'm used to it. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1757.6399999999999s)]
*  B, I don't care. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1759.84s)]
*  C, I'm going to do my job harder when I'm running up against opposition. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1761.76s)]
*  This is our current reality in America, and someone has to just keep trying to do accountability [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1768.12s)]
*  journalism even though there are a lot of pressures on people not to do accountability [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1778.56s)]
*  journalism. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1782.86s)]
*  I got to push back on you because every journalist at a major institution right now is thinking [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1784.04s)]
*  about whether or not the administration is going to be more aggressive with its journalists. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1787.3799999999999s)]
*  When you are in the position that you found yourself, you are consulting with people at [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1793.6799999999998s)]
*  the Atlantic. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1798.32s)]
*  Every major news organization has teams of lawyers, has people to talk to when you find [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1800.08s)]
*  yourselves in situations where you're wondering, what should I do next? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1804.6s)]
*  Are there any legal consequences? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1808.3799999999999s)]
*  You had mentioned earlier that people could deduce why you left that chat ultimately. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1810.6799999999998s)]
*  I respect the fact that you can't go into the details, but I do want to ask you whether [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1815.1999999999998s)]
*  Part of the reason why you left was that you were concerned you could get in trouble for [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1820.0600000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1823.38s)]
*  Were you worried at all that you had stayed in that chat too long? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1824.38s)]
*  Not just you, the people that you're talking to at the Atlantic that presumably you're [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1827.18s)]
*  getting advice from. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1830.5s)]
*  Your Honor, I'm going to respectfully decline to answer that question on the grounds that [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1831.5s)]
*  I can't answer the question. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1837.38s)]
*  I take the nation's laws very seriously, but I am not in a position to discuss decision-making [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1839.3400000000001s)]
*  related to the type of material that I was seeing. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1847.82s)]
*  I understand. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1852.46s)]
*  And obviously at the end of the day, the Atlantic published your story. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1853.58s)]
*  And I just want to zoom out for a second because as we mentioned earlier, you have covered [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1857.46s)]
*  foreign policy for decades. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1861.1599999999999s)]
*  You have covered a lot of White Houses. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1863.1s)]
*  And I assume that this is not the first time that you have had to weigh the public interest [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1865.0s)]
*  in publishing information that could be embarrassing or that the government doesn't want you to [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1870.04s)]
*  publish. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1874.82s)]
*  It's the first time that you've weighed that against national security risks. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1875.82s)]
*  And clearly you decided that the story was worth publishing in the public interest to [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1879.1799999999998s)]
*  know how national security leaders are flouting security protocols. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1883.34s)]
*  And I'm wondering as you're sitting here now at 1141 a.m. on Tuesday, how are you thinking [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1889.1799999999998s)]
*  about this calculation? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1897.9399999999998s)]
*  Do you think that we're safer now knowing what you reported? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1899.24s)]
*  First and foremost, what I discovered was what I consider to be a massive security breach, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1902.68s)]
*  a breach you can drive a Mack truck through. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1907.92s)]
*  The idea of reporting and the idea of having a free press and the idea of holding government [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1910.76s)]
*  officials accountable is that you make the world a better place by telling the citizens [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1914.76s)]
*  what's going on and what the government is doing. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1919.6000000000001s)]
*  And so let's assume that this is a functional government and responds in ordinary ways to [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1922.04s)]
*  the discovery of flaws. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1926.92s)]
*  With any luck, they'll tighten up their procedures and policies. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1928.5s)]
*  I guess the answer to my question depends on if they actually do anything. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1931.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1934.8000000000002s)]
*  It's too early to say. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1936.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we all can speculate about the unusual qualities of this administration and whether [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1937.3600000000001s)]
*  they respond in the way that other administrations would respond to these kind of events or these [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1942.3400000000001s)]
*  kind of revelations. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1948.76s)]
*  Do you think that this event was so egregious that it'll break through just actually just [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1950.4s)]
*  a regular people? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1955.4s)]
*  Is this going to be kind of the same thing that we're so used to, which is one side gets [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1957.24s)]
*  very upset, the other side tries to dismiss it, downplay it until it eventually goes away? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1962.28s)]
*  Is this so bad that it'll break through to the immunity people feel to claims of hypocrisy? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1967.3s)]
*  Look, 10 years ago, Donald Trump insulted the war record of John McCain. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1972.84s)]
*  I listened to that. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1980.56s)]
*  I thought, oh, well, that's it for the Donald Trump campaign because the one thing you don't [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1981.56s)]
*  do is attack war heroes. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1985.32s)]
*  But the rest is history. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1987.4399999999998s)]
*  We know what happened four years ago, five years ago, I reported that Donald Trump referred [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1989.04s)]
*  to the World War I and World War II war dead as suckers and losers. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1993.86s)]
*  And there are people who said, so what? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=1998.08s)]
*  There's always a contingent of people these days who say, so what, for partisan reasons. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2000.96s)]
*  And so I've gotten out of the prediction business. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2005.56s)]
*  The ordinary rules of political physics don't really apply anymore. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2008.76s)]
*  But if it does get brushed off, like, what does that say to you? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2013.24s)]
*  Says that we're in a dangerous place. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2019.44s)]
*  Successful countries respond to observable reality by changing course to account for [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2022.2s)]
*  that reality. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2030.4s)]
*  If these guys go back to using signal to discuss war planning, that's on them. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2032.6s)]
*  That is what you would call reckless behavior. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2039.68s)]
*  If they're going to not change certain procedures because they don't like the media or because [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2043.1s)]
*  they think that the Democrats are also bad, it doesn't, it just doesn't sound like a healthy [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2050.42s)]
*  country. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2056.7799999999997s)]
*  It doesn't sound like a healthy way to run a country. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2057.7799999999997s)]
*  Jeffrey, I want to thank you very much for your time. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2059.7799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2065.22s)]
*  During a contentious hearing on Tuesday in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2070.9s)]
*  two members of President Trump's cabinet who were included in the text exchanges with [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2074.78s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, CIA Director John Radcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2078.7400000000002s)]
*  Gabbard, both denied that any classified material was shared in the messages. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2083.86s)]
*  That prompted expressions of disbelief from several senators, including Angus King of [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2089.42s)]
*  Maine and Independent. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2094.26s)]
*  Secretary Hedgseff put into this group text a detailed operation plan, including targets, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2096.82s)]
*  the weapons we were going to be using, attack sequences and timing. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2104.42s)]
*  And yet you've testified that nothing in that tech, in that chain was classified. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2109.54s)]
*  Wouldn't that be classified? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2115.5s)]
*  What if that had been made public that morning before the attack took place? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2116.82s)]
*  Senator, I can attest to the fact that there were no classified or intelligence equities [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2122.7000000000003s)]
*  that were included in that chat group at any time. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2128.1s)]
*  At one point during the hearing, Democratic Senator John Ossoff of Georgia pressed Radcliffe [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2132.26s)]
*  to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2137.58s)]
*  Director Radcliffe, this was a huge mistake, correct? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2140.7400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2146.78s)]
*  A national, no, no, you hold on. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2149.78s)]
*  No, no, Director Radcliffe, I asked you a yes or no question and now you'll hold on. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2154.86s)]
*  A national political reporter was made privy to sensitive information about imminent military [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2158.5s)]
*  operations against a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2166.86s)]
*  And that wasn't a huge mistake. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2169.94s)]
*  That wasn't a huge mistake. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2173.1800000000003s)]
*  They characterized it as a embarrassment. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2175.02s)]
*  This is utterly unprofessional. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2178.34s)]
*  There's been no apology. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2180.6200000000003s)]
*  There has been no recognition of the gravity of this error. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2182.7000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, after we spoke with him, Jeffrey Goldberg rejected the claims from Radcliffe [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2186.98s)]
*  and Gabber that there was no classified material in the messages saying, quote, they are wrong. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2192.42s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2204.9s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2208.34s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia agreed to cease fighting in the Black Sea and to hash out the details [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2218.42s)]
*  for halting strikes on energy facilities in what would be the first significant step toward [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2222.5s)]
*  a ceasefire three years after Russia launched its war against Ukraine. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2227.02s)]
*  But the deal falls short of a complete pause in fighting and it remains unclear how and [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2231.58s)]
*  the limited troops to be carried out. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2236.8199999999997s)]
*  And President Trump signed a pardon for Devin Archer, a former business partner of Hunter [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2239.94s)]
*  Biden whose congressional testimony two years ago helped to fuel House Republicans' investigation [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2244.98s)]
*  into the Biden family. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2250.54s)]
*  Archer, who had been convicted in a fraud case, earned fans on the right after he testified [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2252.22s)]
*  against Hunter Biden. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDZl9nH9cyw&t=2258.18s)]
