# How Telegram Became the Underworld’s Favorite App
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpZS2Bx_ygY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  A Times investigation has found that one of the world's biggest messaging apps, with
*  nearly a billion users, is also a giant black market and gathering place for terrorists
*  and white supremacists.
*  Today, my colleague Adam Satariano on the extraordinary story of Telegram and how it's
*  led to one of the first arrests of a social media CEO in history.
*  It's Monday, September 23rd.
*  Adam, welcome back to the show.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So Adam, you and our colleagues just published a big investigation into what's going on inside
*  this giant messaging app called Telegram.
*  And it really came at the perfect time because the founder of the platform was arrested in
*  France just a few weeks ago.
*  So tell us what happened.
*  So this was a fascinating case.
*  This guy, Pavel Durov, a Russian tech billionaire, his private plane lands at an airport outside
*  Paris, and he is immediately picked up by the French authorities and detained.
*  And the French authorities at first are providing very little detail about what happened.
*  It happens over a weekend.
*  There's not much public statements being put out.
*  There's a few French media reports.
*  And then a few days later, the French prosecutors put out a press release, one page long, and
*  it just lists all these different things that he's been charged with, complicity in
*  crimes, including the spread of child pornography, drug trafficking, organized gang fraud,
*  criminal conspiracy.
*  And this was a shock and an important moment because Telegram is a massive platform that's
*  used by almost a billion people around the world.
*  And it raised this really fascinating question of to what extent does the head of a tech
*  company be held responsible for what users of that service are now doing?
*  OK, so this is a huge platform.
*  A big chunk of the world uses it and its founder, Durov, is in trouble because of what's
*  happening on it. So let's start with him, Durov.
*  Tell me about him. He's a fascinating character.
*  He was born in the Soviet Union.
*  He moved to Italy when he was a child.
*  His father was an academic and was working there.
*  And then after the fall of the Soviet Union, they moved back to St.
*  Petersburg. And he and his brother, who is a real engineering whiz, become fascinated
*  with an IBM computer that they had brought back with them from Italy.
*  And when Pavel is in university, he's shown Facebook for the first time and he becomes
*  fascinated by it. And he's like, I want to create my own.
*  And so they start their own version of Facebook geared towards Russia, a company known as
*  VK.
*  VKontakte, as it's known in Russian.
*  Yes. And it explodes in popularity.
*  And Durov himself begins to develop a bit of a profile.
*  On the one hand, he becomes known as Russia's Mark Zuckerberg.
*  He starts a social media company.
*  It's at a time when having a startup like that is cool.
*  He's being written about in places like TechCrunch and other Western press.
*  But on the other hand, he's sort of a loose cannon.
*  He has this incident where he throws cash out the window of their offices in St.
*  Petersburg and it leads to a street fight down below.
*  In another instance, he hit a police officer with a car when he's trying to evade a traffic
*  stop because he had driven onto the sidewalk to avoid traffic.
*  And so he has this kind of trollish element to him, but he's one who has a lot of money and
*  therefore a lot of power and influence at the time.
*  So kind of like a tech bro with a troll-y kind of contrarian attitude.
*  But knowing Putin and Russia, that's probably a pretty dangerous position to take at that time
*  in that country.
*  Right. As the popularity of the service takes off, it's also drawing the attention of the
*  Russian authorities who start coming to Dorov and the company for information about users.
*  And it becomes a source of tension.
*  And it's also a point where you start to see Dorov's anti-authority streak come forward.
*  When the authorities were asking for information about some opposition politicians, he
*  responded online by posting a picture of a hoodie wearing dog.
*  And he said, this is my official response to the intelligence services.
*  So thumbing his nose at the Russian authorities, which, as we all know, can be a little
*  dangerous. Exactly.
*  And it comes to a head over some Ukrainian activists that the Russian authorities want
*  Dorov to provide information about.
*  And it becomes this moment where he is forced to decide whether or not he's going to
*  cooperate with Russian authorities or if he is going to have to hand it over.
*  So he is essentially forced to sell the company.
*  He chooses that.
*  So Dorov is essentially forced to abandon his own darling here, his company that he
*  built from scratch.
*  And he chooses to do that rather than to see it become something that he doesn't agree
*  with. Exactly.
*  That must have been pretty painful.
*  Yeah, it was. Obviously, my first company was my baby.
*  I created myself. There was a lot of creativity, time and effort invested in that
*  platform. Dorov doesn't really give many interviews, but a few months ago, he had one
*  with Tucker Carlson and they touched on this moment.
*  But at the same time, you know, I understood that I would rather be free.
*  I would want to take orders from anyone.
*  And I left behind probably a comfortable life.
*  And he makes it really clear that this was a dilemma, but the choice was clear for him.
*  He knew what he had to do.
*  For me, everything in my life was about becoming free.
*  Yes. And to the extent it is possible, my mission in life was to allow other people
*  to also become free in a sense and using the platforms that we create or I created
*  my hope was that they could express their freedoms.
*  For Dorov, this moment ends up being a really important inflection point in his life
*  because in the middle of all this, getting all this pressure from Russian authorities
*  in losing VK, he starts to build a communications platform that he hopes will sit
*  outside any government and that they won't be able to crack down on.
*  And that tool is Telegram.
*  So tell me about the birth of Telegram.
*  How does it get started?
*  Dorov starts Telegram in 2013 and it's the next year in January 2014 that they
*  announced that he's lost VK and he decides to leave Russia and look for a new place
*  to push ahead with this new project.
*  And so he and a handful of engineers, they bounce around to different places.
*  They become something like digital nomads.
*  They're in Berlin, they're in London, they're in San Francisco.
*  They even push out a software update from a boat in Southeast Asia.
*  Wow.
*  They eventually land in Dubai where Dorov says that the government's given assurances
*  that they won't meddle in what they're doing.
*  And he feels it's a place can be a long-term home for Telegram.
*  What does Telegram look like in those early days?
*  So when Telegram first comes out, it's basically a simple messaging app
*  like iMessage or WhatsApp.
*  You can text your friends, you can start small group chats.
*  But over the next few years, Telegram becomes much, much more.
*  In 2015, they added something called channels and these are basically
*  one-way broadcasting features.
*  Any user can start a channel.
*  You send a message and anyone who subscribes will receive it.
*  In governments, public figures and others begin to flock there.
*  Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky is there.
*  You have government agencies that post updates there, but it's also all
*  sorts of random quirky stuff too.
*  You can get reality TV news from Brazil there.
*  You can get math lessons in India there.
*  Prepare for civil service exams.
*  It really runs the gamut.
*  So Telegram is already beginning to sort of transition here from a pure messaging
*  app to some kind of social media platform.
*  Exactly.
*  And they continue down this path.
*  In 2015, they also introduced something called Super Groups.
*  And it's like a typical group chat, but with a lot more people.
*  And so these Super Groups start out with a thousand people user cap.
*  But over the course of the next few years, Telegram increases the cap exponentially.
*  It's 5,000, then 10,000, then a hundred thousand, all the way up to 200,000 in 2019.
*  And how unusual is this, Adam?
*  I mean, do the other tech companies have features like this?
*  Not in the same way.
*  No.
*  In fact, as they were expanding the number of people who could participate in these
*  kinds of groups, others like WhatsApp were going the other direction because of
*  concerns that were being raised about the spread of misinformation or disinformation.
*  And so you have Telegram really moving in a different direction from these other
*  platforms and it helps distinguish it and it helps it grow.
*  Right.
*  And how much is it growing?
*  How popular does Telegram actually get?
*  So Telegram starts off with a hundred thousand users in 2013.
*  And just three years later, it's grown to a hundred million users.
*  And today Telegram has nearly a billion active users.
*  And so just to give you some sense of context, it's the fourth most popular
*  messaging app in the world behind WhatsApp, WeChat, the giant Chinese
*  messaging service, and Facebook Messenger.
*  That's just a wild number of people.
*  It really is.
*  And what's wilder to me is that over the years as Telegram is exploding in
*  popularity, the company itself stays essentially the same size.
*  So Telegram has around 60 core employees and it basically operates still
*  like it's a small startup.
*  There's no HR department.
*  There's like a stitched together content moderation team.
*  There's Dura off at the top and some other core employees and that's it.
*  I mean, this is just so remarkable because when you think of big tech
*  platforms, say like Meta, for example, you think of them employing tens of
*  thousands of workers, not fewer than a hundred like you have here with Telegram.
*  Right.
*  Absolutely.
*  And it's really a reflection of what Telegram is.
*  They don't have a large team of content moderators because they don't need one.
*  They don't believe in it.
*  They're not interested in limiting what their users say or do.
*  Telegram bills itself as anti-establishment.
*  It's anti-authoritarian.
*  It's free speech.
*  It's what Dura believes in.
*  And he's become the sort of free speech folk hero in the tech community.
*  And that ethos is what attracts hundreds of millions of users to
*  Telegram.
*  But it's also what lays the groundwork for Dura's problems because some of those
*  users who are flocking to Telegram are doing so for some pretty nefarious reasons.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, you said that Telegram's ethos created this kind of free for all, which
*  ultimately led to Dura's problems.
*  And that is of course what you and our colleagues have been investigating.
*  So what is actually happening on this platform?
*  Yeah.
*  So by the time Pavel Dura was arrested getting off his jet in Paris, myself and
*  some other colleagues, we were months into an investigation into Telegram.
*  So using software, we were able to analyze 3.2 million messages on Telegram across
*  16,000 channels.
*  And what we soon began to find as we look deeper is the volume of criminal and
*  extremist behavior that is happening on there was really quite shocking.
*  And Adam, when you started to look into these channels, what exactly did you find?
*  One of the main things that we found was the volume of sort of white supremacy and
*  white supremacist groups that are operating in Europe and the United States, especially.
*  And they use Telegram for communication, for recruitment, for sharing their ideology.
*  And in some respects, you see that these groups are also a place for staging violence.
*  There's a group called the Telegram Group.
*  There's a group called Telegram that's been designated a terror organization in the UK
*  where they are plotting violence and sharing information about weapons in other ways to
*  stage potential attacks.
*  And it's really provided a haven for them to grow.
*  So Adam, give me an example of a group that really has used all of these features of
*  Telegram, as you're saying.
*  One of the clearest examples that we found is Hamas.
*  And so when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th, it announced the assault on Telegram.
*  Within a few hours of moving in, they began posting all sorts of videos of the carnage.
*  And you've got over a three day stretch where they posted something like nearly seven
*  hundred times and they get over 54 million views, according to the analysis that we did.
*  Some of the videos of the hostages were shared over Telegram before some of these people
*  were killed.
*  Telegram was this key, key piece of the Hamas propaganda strategy.
*  And so it provides this massive megaphone for Hamas to share information about the
*  phone, for Hamas to share its messaging.
*  What else did you find in your investigation?
*  One of the most surprising things we were able to find is the extent to which Telegram
*  acts as a black market.
*  It is a clearinghouse for all sorts of illegal goods.
*  You can buy handguns, you can buy machine guns, you can buy cocaine.
*  You can buy MDMA.
*  You can buy fraudulent ATM cards.
*  The list goes on and on and on.
*  So in other words, it really simplifies the process of buying or selling something illegal
*  online. You don't have to be a specialist.
*  You can just be anyone with the Telegram app.
*  Exactly. And it's happening brazenly.
*  They post videos of people opening their deliveries, which they will call touchdowns.
*  It has all sorts of slang that's used within a lot of these groups for buying drugs or
*  guns. They act like salesmen like, oh, I can make a good deal for you.
*  I can deliver to these 30 countries.
*  They talk about how to make payments using crypto currencies.
*  They'll have videos of packages of pharmaceuticals that they have for sale.
*  So it's this kind of open air drug and gun market within an iPhone app.
*  So you have to sort of step back and think like, oh, well, bad stuff is on the Internet.
*  Who cares? But usually for this kind of stuff, you have to use the dark web, which
*  requires a special kind of browser.
*  And it has all sorts of hoops that you might have to jump through.
*  With Telegram, it's a simple to use app right there on your phone in your pocket.
*  And people have called it the dark web in your pocket.
*  So, Adam, this is pretty remarkable.
*  I mean, just how much illegal activity is happening on Telegram kind of in plain sight.
*  What can governments and law enforcement do to combat this kind of activity?
*  How are they dealing with this?
*  The governments haven't been able to do much in large part because Duroff and
*  Telegram have refused to cooperate.
*  We spoke to law enforcement and government agencies around the world who
*  expressed extreme frustration in trying to get any sort of cooperation from Telegram.
*  The NYPD told us that they don't even bother to send requests anymore because they
*  don't get any help from Telegram.
*  They've stopped even trying.
*  Yeah.
*  And German prosecutors told us the same thing.
*  I spoke to somebody who just conducted a bunch of research in Argentina and there
*  they have a prosecutor unit dedicated to child sexual abuse material.
*  They can't get any help from Telegram.
*  And so it's this black box where Telegram does not cooperate with law enforcement.
*  And I think this is like a really important point that is what has gotten Telegram
*  into perhaps the most trouble is that companies like Google, Meta, TikTok, they
*  have teams of people who are responsible for responding to requests from law
*  enforcement and thousands of moderators who will take down all sorts of material.
*  Telegram doesn't have that.
*  And so therefore you end up in a situation where there is a lot of illegal activity
*  happening on the platform and nothing is being done about it.
*  And if you are a police department, if you're a prosecutor, that is immensely
*  frustrating and infuriating.
*  So this all brings us, Adam, to Pavel Durov's arrest in France and really helps me
*  understand what the French government might have been trying to tell him.
*  Bring me back to that case and tell me where it stands now.
*  So Pavel Durov is in France now waiting trial.
*  At least one of the charges carries a up to 10 year prison sentence.
*  And the first word of the press release that the French prosecutors put out was
*  complicity. And they're essentially saying that Pavel Durov is complicit in all these
*  crimes that include child pornography, drug trafficking, gang fraud, criminal
*  conspiracy. The list goes on.
*  And so they're saying that because he and his company were so uncooperative in
*  trying to deal with these different crimes, they say that there was an almost total
*  lack of response from Telegram to legal requests.
*  And they finally had enough.
*  And so when his plane landed in France, they grabbed him.
*  And this is pretty unusual, right?
*  I mean, when it comes to social media, we haven't really seen a big tech CEO have
*  held criminally responsible for something like this.
*  Absolutely. I mean, his arrest is a big move by the French authorities.
*  There's little precedent for something like this.
*  They're essentially holding him as the CEO of the company responsible for the behavior
*  of others, basically saying he's an accomplice, he's complicit.
*  And this is not usually how governments have handled these sorts of crimes on social
*  media. And what has Durov said in response?
*  What's his defense?
*  So his main defense seems to be, I'm not responsible for what users do on my platform.
*  He didn't sell the drugs.
*  He didn't sell the guns.
*  He's also said that Telegram is a victim of its success.
*  It grew too fast.
*  And he's expressed some contrition saying they're going to put certain new policies in
*  place to respond more quickly to certain law enforcement requests and to moderate more
*  content. But beyond that, this arrest really cuts to the core of what Telegram
*  stands for. It's like what they've been trying to achieve.
*  For Durov, the whole point of Telegram is to create a platform that's free from government
*  interference. It's not going to submit to government requests.
*  So this stands with its users, not with governments.
*  And in places like Russia and Iran, Telegram has been seen as a force for good.
*  And that makes sense if you're a guy who grew up in Russia, where the government calls
*  anyone it disagrees with a criminal or a terrorist.
*  But in a lot of the rest of the world, including France, people live by laws, not by
*  the whims of an authoritarian leader like Putin.
*  And if they break those laws, the government comes after them as it should.
*  Right. I mean, Durov would have us believe that this situation is incredibly black and
*  white, that in order to have a free space where anyone can openly express themselves,
*  you have to have minimal moderation.
*  It's like censorship or no.
*  And he's arguing that the tradeoff is worth it.
*  That it's better to have Hamas broadcasting and understanding their point of view than
*  to have a Russian police state.
*  But the thing is, it's not totally clear that the situation is this black and white.
*  Most of the tech sector doesn't work this way.
*  Other social media sites like Facebook or YouTube, which are by no means perfect.
*  They have fairly robust policies and teams in place trying to keep the worst activity
*  off their platforms.
*  And they do a fairly good job of cultivating a marketplace for ideas.
*  But like you said, that isn't how Durov sees the world.
*  He has a very black and white view.
*  And there's a really good chance that he's going to be held accountable for the
*  consequences of holding on to those ideals so tightly.
*  Adam, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Over the weekend, a devastating Israeli airstrike on the Lebanese militant group
*  Hezbollah in central Beirut on Friday killed at least 37, including two commanders.
*  The attack leveled two apartment buildings and plunged Lebanon into further chaos.
*  Days after pagers and walkie talkies belonging to Hezbollah members exploded en masse.
*  The attacks appeared to mark a stark shift in the calculations that have long governed
*  the decades old conflict between Israel and Lebanon's most powerful militant group.
*  Until last week, Israel had refrained from launching the kind of attacks that its
*  leaders had feared could provoke retaliatory strikes by Hezbollah.
*  But over the past few days, Israel has crossed what had unofficially been considered
*  red lines. The Times reports that Israel's moves seem to indicate that the country's
*  leaders have decided they can no longer live with the threat of Hezbollah on their
*  northern border.
*  And the Georgia state election board voted on Friday to force counties to hand count
*  all ballots cast on Election Day, a move that critics say could significantly delay
*  the reporting of results in the battleground state and inject chaos into the post-election
*  period. The new rule, which passed on a three to two vote, runs counter to extensive legal
*  advice from election officials and law enforcement officials in the state.
*  The new rule is the latest in a stream of right-wing election policies passed by the
*  state election board over the past few months.
