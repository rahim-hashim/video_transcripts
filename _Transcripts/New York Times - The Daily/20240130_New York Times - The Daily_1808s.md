# Trump’s Voters vs. Haley’s Donors
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Taa00fdf9tE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Inside the Republican Party, a class war is playing out between the pro-Trump base, who's
*  ready for the nomination fight to be over, and the anti-Trump donor class, who thinks
*  it's just getting started. Today, my colleague, Astead Herndon, a political correspondent and
*  host of the run-up, reports on that clash. It's Tuesday, January 30th.
*  Hello. Hello. Hey, how are you? Good. Let me know when you're ready. I'm ready. Okay. So,
*  Astead, at this moment in the Republican presidential race, two kind of baffling
*  things are occurring at the same time. This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left
*  to go. The first is that former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is behaving as if she really
*  has a shot at beating Donald Trump. We still have a ways to go, but we keep moving up. Which all
*  evidence suggests is false. And the second thing that's happening is that Donald Trump... And just a
*  little note to Nikki. She's not going to win. ...is fixated on attacking Nikki Haley and her campaign
*  over and over. She said, wow, she's doing like a speech like she won. She didn't win. She lost.
*  And, you know... Despite the fact that she has no real shot at beating him. But let's not have
*  somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night. She had a very bad night. And you... And you
*  have been studying the Republican presidential race very closely over the past few months. So,
*  my question for you is, why are both of these things happening? And what do they tell us about
*  this political moment in the Republican party? Yeah. I mean, I think if you see it through the
*  lens of just Donald Trump versus Nikki Haley and two candidates that are vying to get the nomination,
*  then you're right. It is kind of baffling. You know, Haley has always been a long shot to become the
*  Republican nominee. And that's even become more clear as voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, and
*  particularly the Republican base has made it overwhelmingly obvious that their preference is
*  Donald Trump. Indeed. But I think if you view it through a different lens, and specifically the
*  kind of broader coalitions that these two candidates represent, and the donors that support these
*  campaigns, then I think you understand why they feel so diametrically opposed and why the slices
*  of the Republican party who are supporting them see themselves as diametrically opposed. So,
*  what I mean by that is the more Nikki Haley stays in the race, the more it fuels the distaste on the
*  Trump MAGA movement side, specifically because they see her as a candidate who represents the
*  interest of a elite donor class, of a moderate Republican wing that's more lenient on issues of
*  immigration, that is more deferential to the foreign policy establishment and embrace kind of
*  American intervention in wars abroad. And those are such fundamental beliefs when you think about
*  the kind of Donald Trump wing of the Republican party, that they see someone like Haley as being
*  offensive to the idea that that's what the Republican party in 2024 represents. And when I was at
*  Donald Trump's victory party in Nashville, New Hampshire last week, when we see the results
*  rolling in that confirm another victory, it wasn't just that the supporters in the building were
*  mocking Nikki Haley and kind of gloating on the fact that they were winning. They were also mocking
*  what they call the elite donor Republican class, who they think is funding Nikki Haley. So, when we
*  were watching the results on the screen on Tuesday, first off, reintroduce yourself. My name is John
*  Fredericks. I'm a TV and radio talk show host. And more importantly, the Godzilla of the Truth. I am
*  the Godzilla of the Truth. I'm on in the morning. I talked to a conservative radio host named John
*  Fredericks. He's someone who has aligned himself with Donald Trump and really gives a good
*  articulation of what the MAGA movement represents. Listen, this is the greatest movement, the
*  populist movement of working people in the history of the Republic. And these donors on Wall Street
*  don't get it. They don't understand the party has changed. This is a working class party now.
*  White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, it doesn't matter. If you work for a living, and you are punching a
*  clock, and you're not part of the elite, right, you're getting screwed. And they know it. Your jobs
*  are going away. Your wages are eroding. Your profit share is going down. Your savings is getting
*  obliterated with inflation. You're getting wiped out. They don't care. Illegals are overrunning
*  your country. They're taking your jobs. They're shipping into China. And the elites and the donor
*  class and the Wall Street gangster banksters who live for open borders and cheap labor
*  just think they can buy this stuff. Those are the type of messages that the Donald Trump
*  wing of the Republican Party is putting out there about Nikki Haley, kind of framing the efforts as
*  a elite undemocratic idea that they can talk over what the working class Republican person wants.
*  And of course, what they're saying that working class Republican wants is Donald Trump. But one
*  of the things that he said that really sticks with me is that they see the MAGA movement
*  as something that is independent from any individual candidate.
*  It's our movement. Right now, Donald Trump is the conduit for that. Post-Trump, there'll be
*  someone else. Because the populist movement is on the verge tonight of obliterating the establishment
*  uniparty elite. And we're weeks away from taking over the whole Republican Party apparatus, if not
*  weeks, a year. And so in supporting Donald Trump, they're not only doing that because they want him
*  to be the individual candidate. They're doing that because they see him as a conduit to be able to
*  root out that slice of the Republican Party, the kind of donor class that supports Haley, which they
*  find kind of detrimental to their overall interest. Right. They want to reclaim the Republican Party
*  from rich donors and fully ensure that it's in the hands of the MAGA movement, which in their minds is
*  a working class movement, kind of profoundly and inevitably at odds with a bunch of rich donors.
*  100%. And not just at odds with rich donors, odds with party leadership, at odds with the kind of
*  Washington establishment. They feel that they are distinct from the kind of political institutions
*  and apparatus that keep people in defined lines that they want to bust out of. And so I think
*  that's a little bit of a different way to view the different candidacies. I think Nikki Haley has
*  supporters, people who are voting for her because of her stances on particular issues or because
*  their desire to see them as the nominee. Donald Trump runs a group that thinks of themselves as a
*  movement that is more than just supporting a candidate, but is a vehicle to overtake the party
*  itself. But to the question of why she's still in the race, when all the signs point to that movement
*  you're describing working and defeating her, what do you say? I mean, candidates drop out of races
*  not because of their own volition, but mostly because they run out of money and they run out
*  of support and the path to making them president. And so I think that it is critical to understanding
*  if you're asking why is Nikki Haley still in this race, it's because there are enough Republican
*  donors who are willing to continue to support her to stay in this race. And I think this is unique
*  to this year, partially because some people don't want to see the primary in so fast, partially
*  because Donald Trump has legal issues hanging over his head. And so there are some reasons in the air
*  about why that support has continued. But for the Trump wing of the party, what they are saying
*  is that the existence of that support is a anti-democratic perversion of the people's will.
*  So thinking back to my question about why is Haley staying in the race, why are Trump and his
*  supporters kicking her around so hard? The answers are kind of interrelated and they're very much
*  tied to what you just laid out, which is the sense that donors whose values and visions are very much
*  at odds with the MAGA movement, they're fueling the Haley movement beyond its expiration date,
*  according to Trump supporters. And that is why Trump and his supporters are so mad at this campaign.
*  Exactly. And I think it's important to not just view this in the vacuum of 2024, but this is the
*  entire premise of Donald Trump's candidacy and his ascension in the Republican Party.
*  He came in as the quote unquote outsider, as a person who had his own individual money and was
*  therefore unreliant to big donors. There is a sense among his supporters and a sense that he
*  furthers in his own kind of rhetoric that he is the only candidate that is untethered to the
*  political institutions that serve the elites. And that is not only donors, but that is the
*  political establishment in Washington. This is the message of Donald Trump. And so being at that
*  event in Nashville, seeing the open vitriol, not only to the Haley campaign, but to the Republican
*  donors who are backing her, made me think about the kind of broader question of the party's unity
*  going forward. So the next morning, after the results had come in, I decided to call a Haley
*  donor, a billionaire who was backing her, to see how we saw the race going forward and how we would
*  respond to the argument that in giving so much money to a candidate who is such a long shot,
*  he is kind of seeking to upend the will of the voters.
*  After the break, a Steads conversation with that donor.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hi, Stead, how are you?
*  I'm doing well. How are you?
*  Good.
*  Tim Draper is a venture capitalist who's invested in companies like Tesla, Skype,
*  Hotmail, Twitch, and Robinhood. I mean, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? Can you tell
*  me about like how, tell me about your business career and how you made money in the first place?
*  Yeah. So I started out as an entrepreneur. Oh, let me go way back. My grandfather was the first
*  Silicon Valley venture capitalist. My father was a venture capitalist. I had venture capital in my
*  blood. It was a-
*  He's given more than a million dollars to Haley's campaign and the outside groups that are backing
*  her. I guess I would start with just saying like, what caused you to back Nikki Haley and
*  specifically what caused you to donate your money to Nikki Haley?
*  Yeah. I have been really impressed with her. I think she has very good character. I think she is
*  kind. She is very thoughtful. She sees all points of view on things like pro-choice versus pro-life.
*  She understands foreign policy, which is, I travel a lot. I go all over the world.
*  And I've seen how important our foreign policy is and how we are represented internationally.
*  And I like her attitude of, I support my friends. I support democracies. I don't support
*  dictatorships. When I first met her, I just thought, wow, this woman is strong and capable
*  and she gets things done. And you see that she does it in an effective way where everybody comes
*  out feeling good. And I think there's a strong character there and she's tough and she's willing
*  to run for president. I mean, for somebody that amazing to be willing to run for president,
*  I think we were just lucky.
*  One of the things that we've reported on through this show is how Nikki Haley has a difficult path
*  to win the Republican nomination, partially because the ways the party has changed in the
*  Donald Trump era. When you are giving to her, when you are backing her originally, I guess I'm
*  wondering kind of how were you thinking about her path to victory in the primary considering
*  Donald Trump has changed the party to such a degree?
*  You know, it's funny. I miscalculated on one thing and that was that I didn't realize
*  that those Trump supporters just want retribution. They're just angry and they want retribution and
*  they stopped listening. And I was thinking, oh my God, a Trump-Biden combination, it would be
*  ridiculous. Why? We got so many great candidates out there. Why would we ever want these two
*  octogenarians to be, you know, our two candidates?
*  You thought everyone was kind of on the same page, that you want the same thing,
*  that you want the same thing again.
*  Right. I didn't think anybody really wanted that. But I think that there is so much animosity build
*  up. And I don't know which side is right here. I don't have a really strong feeling about,
*  you know, whether, you know, the people who are saying he was wronged or the people who are saying
*  he's a felon are right. I don't know. That'll come out in the courts or whatever. But I did think,
*  you know, he might have been a good candidate eight years ago. I'm not so sure that makes any
*  sense today. But his supporters are just so much after retribution that I think they stopped
*  listening. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of where I wanted to go. I mean, obviously there were high
*  hopes for Nikki Haley in New Hampshire specifically, because it has so much more of the independent
*  votes, the moderate kind of Republican voter. I think about the results last night, as I'm sure
*  you watched. Would you say like, is an 11 point loss there an example of her gaining traction?
*  Or should we take the results from Iowa and New Hampshire as evidence that the majority of the
*  Republican base is squarely behind Donald Trump? No, I think, you know, she had 2% of the vote when
*  I started backing her. And she is now at 43% of the vote. She had 20% in Iowa. The trend is good.
*  He still polls better than she does. But I think that that is changing. And now is the time to
*  support her so she gets into the general election. So what I hear, you're saying the trend line is
*  such that you still feel good about that investment in the Haley campaign. And will you get more money
*  going forward? Should she stay in this race? I know that's an open question that some people are
*  trying to pressure her to get out. What's your message to that?
*  No, no, a lot happens in politics and she's down to just the two of them. She should definitely
*  stay in. A lot can happen through, you know, South Carolina, Super Tuesday. So no, I think she should
*  go, go, go. I'm very happy with the investment I made. And I wrote a song for her. I mean, I was
*  going to go to the song next. So I'm glad you brought this up because I recently heard the song.
*  It's a real earworm. I listened to it yesterday and I have to say I did wake up today with,
*  you know, we need you, Nikki, right now. Still stuck in my head. I was going to ask,
*  can I hear some of the rap? Can you drop a little for us right now?
*  No, I'm not sure I can because I don't, I don't have it all in my, I know it sticks in your ear.
*  We need you, Nikki, right now to lead our nation. We need you, Nikki. There we go.
*  Somehow, we need the conversation.
*  We need you, Nikki, right now to lead our nation. We need you, Nikki, no doubt.
*  With the conversation.
*  And then it's, oh, I can tell you this part of the rap. It's Trump the bully who's afraid of a fight
*  against five inch heels with twice as might. And Biden is dying to drain our reserves.
*  When voters come out, he'll get his deserves.
*  We need you, Nikki, right now.
*  I mean, that's a different level of dedication to a candidate than we typically see, right?
*  I guess I'm asking, like, considering the high road she has to climb to become the nominee,
*  what made you say this moment right now is all in? Is that the candidate or is that the political
*  moment at large? It's the candidate. I think it's Nikki Haley. And we tend to get the candidate
*  we need at the time we need it in America. Nikki Haley gets it.
*  One of the things that stuck out to me at the Trump victory party last night is that they're
*  not just mocking or kind of demeaning Nikki Haley, which there was a lot of. There was a
*  lot of mocking and demeaning of the kind of donor class, too. They would say pretty openly that
*  the reason she's going to stay in this race is because people who are rich Republicans are
*  going to fund her money. And what they're trying to do is speak over the will of the voter who
*  have made clear the kind of working class Republican voter wants to back Trump. I guess I wanted to
*  hear you respond to that idea. What do you say to the idea that what the donor class is trying to
*  do in terms of keeping Nikki Haley afloat is against the will of the base Republican voter?
*  Well, I'm rich, but a lot of the donors are not. You know what they're getting? It's interesting.
*  In the Haley campaign, they're getting a lot of small donations from women,
*  and they're getting donations from Democrats. That was the big-
*  Those aren't Republicans, you know? That's not the base of the Republican party. Is that a problem?
*  No. Well, I mean, it depends on what you mean by a base. I think Trump just has a lot of people who
*  they're just thinking of, hey, he needs retribution. And they're saying, I'm not
*  thinking about anything else. And I hope that they open their minds and I hope that they
*  start looking at it in a new way. But I can't see that happening overnight.
*  Kind of my last question is to look ahead. I know you're hosting a fundraiser for Nikki Haley soon.
*  I guess I'm asked- Two.
*  You're hosting two. Okay. I guess the question I have is what are the markers that you're looking
*  for for the campaign to continue the upward trajectory that I think we both know it needs?
*  And then a follow-up question I have is this, if it does end up being Biden versus Trump again,
*  do you know what you would do? Would you donate? Would you vote Trump? Do you know?
*  I don't think that's going to happen. And I think Nikki Haley will be the president.
*  If it were in that situation, I would kind of desperately look for a third party.
*  And I think a lot of people would too. I think there's going to be a very interesting couple
*  of months here. A lot of things happen in politics and I think a lot of things will happen.
*  So I hear the first step being look to South Carolina and Super Tuesday,
*  invest more to try to give Haley the bump that she needs and continue to close that gap with Trump.
*  And then maybe a secondary step if this does get to a thing that you don't want,
*  being a rematch of 2020, would you invest money in a third or you'll just deal with that? Well,
*  we might have to follow up in a couple of months.
*  I don't know. The thing that went off in my head was a, what do you call it? A
*  fight or run? Yeah, yeah. The fighter flight.
*  Some instinctual nature would kick in.
*  I don't know. I don't know which way I'm going to go. I'm going to either fight this thing out or
*  I'm going to run.
*  I said, ultimately, what do you make of this donor of Draper? Is he in denial about the state of
*  this race and the reality of the Republican Party in this moment? And how representative
*  is he of donors to Haley in both senses? Yeah. I mean, when I talk to him, I definitely hear a
*  person who is disconnected from the Republican base, right? To say the least, at Draper's defense,
*  a lot of people are. His presumption that the Republican base will not come back to
*  Donald Trump considering all the things that have happened in the last couple of years was a
*  widespread belief that was not just true among a donor class. I think that was true among a lot of
*  people who have underrated the consistency and cohesion of the MAGA movement. So I would say,
*  if he is in delusion, it's a delusion that's shared by a lot of people.
*  Well, looking back, why was there so much delusion given the steamroller that Trump has always been
*  within the Republican Party? Well, I mean, I think certainly post midterms, there was an overly
*  presumptuous idea among the party establishment that Donald Trump's electoral losses would start
*  to weigh on the base and that some people would look for other options because of it. And one
*  thing I think was the biggest part of the shared delusion was the secondary presumption that had
*  his indictments would hurt him, that the candidates themselves did not have to make
*  Donald Trump unpalatable because the legal cases would do the work for them.
*  Which as we know, has been not only wrong, the opposite of the truth.
*  Right. It made him more popular and more popular.
*  And so after the midterms, normal political logic would tell you that the electoral results,
*  the legal cases would inherently add up to a universe where Donald Trump could not be the
*  Republican nominee again, and particularly not at this kind of wide of a margin or clarity of
*  resolve. And that was a presumption that was made without the Republican base input.
*  But this is why I keep going back to movement politics is because that's the answer to why
*  those rules don't really apply here is because they are not thinking in the traditional political
*  calculus and they'll tell you that. They simply tell you that all the time. I just think it's an
*  unwillingness to believe them. So the Drapers of the world are not just trying to make Nikki
*  Haley happen. They are trying to undo reality. Right. And when we think about Haley's donors,
*  all of them, and how representative is Draper and his view of the situation,
*  basically that if Haley loses, he's out of the Republican Party.
*  To the question of like how representative of the larger donor class, I think we've gotten some
*  answers to that in the last couple of days since the New Hampshire primary. Big donors like Reid
*  Hoffman, the founder of Home Depot, who's a big mover and shaker in Republican politics, announced
*  that he was going to take a pause on supporting Nikki Haley because he sees a hard time seeing
*  the path forward. At the same time, there's clearly enough donors still supporting her
*  that the Trump campaign is taking it very seriously. Trump announced that he would try to
*  blacklist donors who would continue to support Nikki Haley, a clear attempt to pressure people
*  to kind of abandon her and make the party rally around him as the presumptive nominee.
*  But the thing that I think is important is when you talk to the Trump movement,
*  they say they don't care either way. They have multiple goals, and the biggest goal is to return
*  Donald Trump to the White House. So even losing the general election is obviously not what they
*  want. Certainly the MAGA capture of Republicans has given them problems with independence,
*  and they would need a Nikki Haley base if they want to unite the Republican Party to go against
*  Joe Biden. But a subset goal, a thing that John Frederick says very explicitly, is to own the
*  Republican Party. That's why it's important to see it not as a traditional political campaign
*  that operates in tactics, but to see it as a movement that operates in ideals, right? Because
*  the most important thing is to run a campaign that's based on those ideals, and they basically
*  think they'll get with us or they'll get lost. There's an understanding, it sounds like you're
*  saying, that this effort to obliterate the Haley-style donor class and the establishment
*  of the party, it might mean they lose the election. They understand that Haley has
*  not just donors, but lots of supporters who they may not win over. And because it's a movement,
*  what you're suggesting is they may be able to live with that. Yes, but remember, they already
*  asked Nikki Haley on the stage would she support Donald Trump in the general election, and she's
*  already raised her hand. The majority of Republicans are going to vote for Donald Trump, no matter how
*  much he mocks, no matter how much he demeans, right? You know, Democrats work from a premise
*  of appeasing a kind of liberal to moderate group and expecting progressives to come along.
*  And the Republican base has basically appeased their most conservative sect and think that middle
*  will come along. And we'll find out if they're right. Yeah.
*  I think the specific thing this year is considering the staleness of the candidates.
*  Does that lead people to drop off altogether? Does that lead people to vote third party?
*  How does that fall? I don't think we know the answer to that.
*  Hmm. Well said. Thank you very much. Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Monday, the most important United Nations relief agency in
*  Gaza, the UNRWA, warned that its funding could dry up by the end of next month after more than a dozen
*  countries suspended their financial support. The collapse of support was the result of Israel's
*  claim made on Friday that 12 of the agency's workers in Gaza participated in Hamas's October
*  7th terror attack on Israel. The United Nations has fired the accused workers, but outrage from
*  Israel's allies has mounted. Among the countries that have suspended support for the UNWRA are
*  the United States, Canada, Germany, and the UK. And a former IRS contractor who pleaded guilty to
*  leaking confidential tax records to journalists, including those of former President Trump,
*  was sentenced on Monday to the maximum of five years in jail. The contractor, Charles Littlejohn,
*  admitted that he disclosed Trump's tax information to the New York Times in 2019,
*  and later leaked tax documents from thousands of wealthy Americans to the news organization
*  ProPublica. Taken together, the documents showed that wealthy Americans like Trump
*  pay little or no federal taxes. Today's episode was produced by Kaitlin O'Keefe and Mary Wilson,
