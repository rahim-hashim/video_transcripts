# A Salacious Conspiracy or Just 34 Pieces of Paper?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gecvn6LOOjQ)
*  It's 621 a.m. on Monday. I'm walking past City Hall downtown. Just a couple blocks away
*  from the courthouse where openings are going to begin today and Trump's trial. One thing
*  that's really striking to me about today is that we've all known the story that's about
*  to be told for a long time now. And I can tell you it gets a little dull writing the words
*  stemming from a hush money payment to a porn star in each story. Stemming from a hush money
*  payment to a porn star. But now it's really happening. This is a case, a criminal case
*  against Donald Trump. And today it's going to be presented to a jury. It's gone from story to reality.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. This is The Daily. Today, the prosecution and the
*  defense lay out their case in the first criminal trial of Donald Trump. We turn once again to my
*  colleague Jonah Bromwich, who watched from inside the courtroom. It's Tuesday, April 23rd. Oh, hello.
*  You're wearing a courtroom tie. That's right. First day. Very handsome. Thank you. Okay. You ready?
*  I'm ready. Okay. Well, Jonah, welcome back. Thank you. I want to start with kind of credit where
*  credit is due. You last week, when you came and spoke about jury selection in this trial,
*  predicted against all odds that it would take a single week, which I was pretty skeptical of. You
*  were right. And I wonder if you can just, I mean, you know, sometimes we get it right, sometimes we
*  get it wrong. When you get it right, you get some points. Just describe the final jury that we ended
*  up getting given as you had told us the huge importance of the jury to this case. Sure. So five
*  of them are women. Seven of them are men that are from all over Manhattan, as we knew would happen.
*  We also know that this is a really highly educated group. We've got a lot of advanced degrees. We've
*  got people who work in technology, in business, in the law, very stereotypical white collar
*  professions. And you'll remember when we talked last that we were talking about how being an
*  interesting juror is a little bit of a downside if you want to get picked. Right. Because if you're
*  interesting, you probably posted something on Twitter or Facebook that meant that you weren't
*  going to get on this jury. Yeah, that's exactly right. And that's what we saw happen is that the
*  defense picked up on people who had old posts attacking Trump and they got them dismissed in
*  any way possible. Right. But that doesn't mean that jurors on this panel that we have seated
*  don't have strong opinions about Trump. It just means we don't know. So right. We got the
*  uninteresting people now on this jury. And so in a sense, their views are far more of a black box
*  than the jurors who were dismissed. Black box is exactly right. If it's like the speed with which
*  this jury selection happened tells us something about the personality of the judge in this case,
*  that right. That's exactly right. I think it's a really key point here. So the judge is named
*  Juan Murchon. He's 61 years old. He has presided over several trials involving Trump or his
*  associates, most prominently, the trial of the Trump Organization Trump's company in 2022, in
*  which the company was convicted of a crime. Murchon knows that Trump's favored tactic is delay.
*  He's dealt with it before. And he almost seems to be countering that by speeding the trial long as
*  much as he can. So we saw that last week as he swore in groups of jurors, whenever there was a
*  free moment, it seemed like and we saw it today too. How do we see it today? Today, we thought we
*  were only going to go until 2pm because of the Passover holiday. But early in the morning, the
*  judge gets onto the bench and he says, actually, a juror has a dentist appointment. So we need to
*  stop even earlier. We need to stop at 1230. And those of us in the press look around and we say,
*  oh, well, we'll be lucky to get even through opening statements today. Not only did we get
*  through opening statements, prosecution and defense, but we also got our first witness today,
*  David Pecker. So I want to start with the first thing that happened, which is the opening arguments
*  from the prosecution from in this case, the district attorney's office in Manhattan. Tell us
*  about that. Starting with opening arguments means starting with a guy named Matthew Colangelo. And
*  we haven't seen him that much yet during jury selection. He's been pretty quiet overall. And
*  remember, listeners are not going to be able to hear from him at all because there's no recording
*  in the courtroom. So we're just going to have to kind of retell you what he said and quote him as
*  much as possible. And luckily, you're very good at that. Thank you. But he stands up, he walks to
*  the podium and he begins to explain to the jurors in very clear, precise language, what they will
*  see during trial. And what he describes is this fascinating tale of political conspiracy. He says
*  that Trump met with his former fixer, Michael Cohen, and David Pecker, former publisher of the
*  National Enquirer. And the three came to an agreement, a conspiratorial agreement, Colangelo
*  says, to promote positive stories about Trump, and more importantly, suppress negative ones. And so
*  then Colangelo begins to talk about some of those stories. Such as what? So there are three stories
*  at issue here. The first is from a former doorman and a Trump org building, who was seeking to sell
*  a story of Trump allegedly fathering a child out of wedlock. Which turns out not to be true. Yes,
*  that one is not true. But nonetheless, the National Enquirer, to use a phrase that people have been
*  familiar with for a while now, they caught and they killed that story. They took that story, which
*  was available for sale, and they made sure that no one would hear about it. By which we mean, they
*  paid somebody to give them the story that they then never ran. That's exactly right. The second of
*  these transactions involves a woman named Karen McDougall. And she was selling a story of an
*  affair with Trump. So again, the National Enquirer stepped in, they bought the story, the story never
*  saw the light of day. And then finally, Colangelo describes something that's become very familiar to us,
*  which is the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, who also had a story to sell about having head sex
*  with Trump. But in this case, there's a wrinkle. The National Enquirer had an awful lot of trouble
*  getting paid back for the Karen McDougall payment.
*  Paid back by?
*  Paid back by the Trump camp.
*  Ah, they expected the Trump camp to basically reimburse them for the catch and kill.
*  That's right. So when they had trouble getting paid, it increased their reluctance to get involved in
*  yet another one of these catch and kill stories. And so when Stormy Daniels comes through with her
*  story of having had sex with Trump, Michael Cohen himself, Trump's fixer, ultimately, after hemming
*  and hawing a bit, goes and pays her himself. And then importantly, Trump pays him back from the
*  White House. And prosecutors say that Trump disguises those payments. There's 34 records of
*  payments. And instead of saying these are payments for a hush money to Stormy Daniels, they say
*  legal services. These were for legal services because we have Michael Cohen. He's a lawyer. He's
*  working for Trump. And that's what he's getting paid for.
*  Okay, well, what is the point of the prosecutor here laying out this conspiracy between Trump, the
*  guy from the National Enquirer and Trump's fixer, Michael Cohen? What's the kind of larger legal
*  foundation he's building?
*  I would say there's two things he's doing that are really, really important. The first is this is
*  scintillating. It's payoffs, it's politics, it's porn starts, it's everything that makes this case
*  as dazzling and interesting as you could possibly imagine. And we see the jurors are taking notes,
*  kind of frantic notes on what he's saying.
*  Interesting.
*  But legally speaking, what's important here is that you'll remember that Trump is charged with
*  falsifying business records, not any of the stuff that we've just been talking about. And the reason
*  that the conspiracy that Colangelo is talking about is important is because falsifying business
*  records is only a felony if it was undertaken to help commit or conceal another crime. The
*  prosecutors here are focused on concealing a crime. And for months and months, we've been asking,
*  well, what crime was concealed here? Today, we get our specific answer. What Matthew Colangelo says
*  in his opening statement is that they falsified business records to conceal the crime of
*  entering a conspiracy to promote an election and that the people who entered that conspiracy were
*  Trump, Cohen, and David Pecker.
*  I just want to recap this because it's a little bit complicated. What we learned from the opening
*  statement here from the prosecution is that the way that falsifying business records, which is what
*  Trump is accused of, becomes a felony is if it's used to conceal a different alleged crime, that
*  alleged crime is an election crime. And what the prosecutor is saying here is that all those
*  conspiracies you just described, that is evidence of this second crime. That's how you get to felony
*  charges. That's how you get to the very fact of this trial.
*  That's right. This crime is like fusion, right? Falsifying business records fuses with
*  something else. Now we see that that something else seems to be this state election crime,
*  conspiracy to promote elections. So fusion of conspiracy to promote election and falsifying
*  business records.
*  Before we move on, I want to ask you potentially slightly annoying question. You mentioned that the
*  second concealed crime here might be a violation of a state law surrounding the promotion of an
*  election. How do you violate that law? And do the prosecutors say how Trump violated it?
*  So this is what's so interesting about what prosecutors did today. They don't actually have to
*  prove it. Why? They've gotten to the stage of their case where it's just baked into the charges.
*  They are felony charges. And so all they have to do to win is to convince the jury that their story
*  makes sense and that Trump falsified business records. And so on the front end, if they show you
*  that he was trying to win the election by suppressing these stories, then on the back end,
*  once they show you the records being disguised, they say that the jury will be persuaded of why
*  they said he did it.
*  Okay. Now that that complicated legal business is squared away, what else should we know about the
*  prosecutor's opening statement?
*  Colangelo then just walks the jurors through each witness they're going to hear from and how it
*  builds back into the case they're trying to make.
*  Got it.
*  One of those witnesses is Michael Cohen, of course, who was a prominent member of what
*  prosecutors said was a conspiracy. And one of the things that Colangelo does is he kind of cleans
*  up for the prosecution what Cohen is going to be like.
*  What do you mean?
*  He says that you can expect that the defense lawyers will say Cohen is not credible and that he
*  can't be trusted because he's this guy who's been convicted of federal crimes.
*  Which is true.
*  Who's changed his story many, many times.
*  And what Colangelo says is, look, this is a guy who worked with Trump and his story makes sense
*  when as a whole, you look at how Trump operated.
*  He needed someone like this to go around and fix his problems.
*  And so Cohen is in fact, regardless of what the defense might say about his credibility, the exact
*  type of person you'd expect to see in Trump's orbit.
*  And he says that Cohen, by telling the truth now, when he used to work for Trump and tell lies, is
*  redeeming himself, is redeeming himself in a way that the defendant has not.
*  I'm curious if you think this tactic seemed to kind of work in the moment, in the room, to try to
*  preemptively defend against the attacks the prosecution expects will be leveled against a star
*  witness, Michael Cohen.
*  It's a pretty common tactic.
*  So I think there's a reason prosecutors do it.
*  And prosecutors have a really difficult task with Cohen.
*  They have to make him look like a criminal, too.
*  But they also need him to testify for them.
*  So they need to hold him close and hug him tight while also making him look like the kind of guy who
*  would have made a payoff to a porn star to keep her silent.
*  Right.
*  All of this suggests that prosecutors are going to be very reliant on Michael Cohen and his testimony.
*  How much of what they hope to get from him and his problematic background is also available to them
*  in the form of documents and other corroborating evidence?
*  That's exactly how Colangelo transitions away from talking about Cohen.
*  He says the phrase extensive paper trail.
*  He's saying exactly what you're asking, Michael.
*  They do have documents.
*  They have a recording with Trump on it talking about one of the hush money deals.
*  They have things that will make Cohen's story add up.
*  Is what he says.
*  Got it. So how does the prosecution ultimately end this opening statement?
*  Colangelo comes back to the beginning.
*  He says again, quote, This case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover up.
*  He acknowledges the bigness of the case.
*  He encourages jurors to tune out the noise.
*  You mean the media, this conversation, all of it.
*  Exactly.
*  And then he looks at them and he says, quote, We are confident you will have no reasonable doubt that
*  Donald Trump is guilty and he's done and he sits down and it's time for the defense.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jonah, tell us about the defense's opening arguments, because as you hinted at, the
*  prosecution's case is kind of familiar.
*  The defense's arguments all feel much more novel.
*  The defense's opening statement is delivered by Todd Blanch, who's defending Trump not only in this
*  criminal matter, but in some of the other ones, too.
*  He's a former federal prosecutor and he gets up to the podium.
*  You'll remember that we said that the last words that Colangelo spoke were Donald Trump is guilty.
*  Well, Blanch's first words are President Trump is innocent.
*  So what is Blanch's central defense?
*  I think the defense opening statement can be split into two separate parts.
*  OK.
*  The first is no crime here.
*  There's nothing to see.
*  They say that a candidate trying to promote himself to win a presidential election is not a crime and
*  that everything Trump did that prosecutors have just described.
*  The conspiracy.
*  Exactly.
*  It's part of the normal course of running for office.
*  One meets with publishers.
*  One promotes stories about oneself.
*  One perhaps tries to put out opposition research to promote negative stories about one's
*  opponent. This is standard practice, the defense says, for a presidential candidate.
*  OK.
*  Here, I just want to point out that it does not seem to be, traditionally speaking, normal
*  standard practice to try to catch and kill and potentially even reimburse a media company for a
*  catch and kill when it comes to the story of a sexual affair.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I think we should just be clear about that.
*  Yeah.
*  I nodded frantically while you said that because you're 100 percent right.
*  This is an unusual situation for a presidential candidate.
*  What does the defense lawyer have to say about this concept that what Trump was doing was
*  trying to essentially keep essential information from the public, paying off people to
*  deny voters essential information?
*  He doesn't wade into that territory deeply enough to have to counter each and every of the
*  prosecution's points. And this is a classic defense thing.
*  You seize on the stuff that makes sense to seize on and you kind of try and shush away the
*  elements that you don't want jurors to focus on.
*  Because think about it, if you were a juror and you were listening to this case and you just heard Todd
*  Blanch say he was trying to run for president, how can it be a crime to try and run for
*  president? Especially if you were sympathetic to Trump, you might think, well, that makes sense.
*  And what the defense hopes will happen is that these little seeds will stick in jurors minds.
*  And when it comes to deliberations, weeks and weeks from now, the jurors will get stuck on one of
*  the points that they made.
*  And the biggest of all these seeds seems to be Blanch's argument that when you run for
*  president, you do almost anything you can to try to win.
*  Right. They want to make what the prosecution is describing look a lot more normal and a lot
*  less seedy than prosecutors want them to think.
*  And so the other example of that, the other kind of not crime here, according to the defense, is
*  the falsification of business records.
*  The defense says these business records weren't falsified.
*  Michael Cohen was a lawyer for Trump.
*  He was repaid by the Trump Organization for Legal Services, aka his job.
*  Trump had nothing to do with it anyway.
*  And Todd Blanch looks at these documents, these all important documents, the prosecution's case,
*  and he just dismisses them as quote unquote thirty four pieces of paper.
*  Hmm. So in their telling, even reimbursing Michael Cohen for paying off Stormer Daniels
*  potentially can be legally construed as him performing legal services.
*  That's right. Todd Blanch wants the jury to believe that this repayment was just the normal
*  course of business.
*  Nothing to see here again.
*  What if anything does Trump's lawyer here have to say about the witnesses the prosecutors
*  plan to call, especially, of course, Michael Cohen.
*  Todd Blanch has a lot to say about Michael Cohen.
*  And I had thought that Blanch would maybe try and slow walk his criticism of Cohen because
*  there's a little bit of danger here.
*  You don't want to seem so embittered and so angry that you convince the jury that you're the one
*  who has an axe to grind.
*  But Blanch ramps up pretty quickly.
*  He calls him a criminal.
*  He calls him a liar.
*  He accuses Cohen of being completely obsessed with Trump.
*  He says, quote, He's obsessed with President Trump even to this day.
*  Cohen is out for revenge, wants to see Trump in prison.
*  And Cohen actually had given the defense a real gift because as recently as last night, the
*  defense said he had called Trump a, quote, despicable human being and said he wanted to see
*  the former president convicted.
*  Wow.
*  So if Blanch is trying to argue to jurors, hey, this guy, Michael Cohen, hates my client.
*  Michael Cohen helpfully chimes in for the defense and says, hey, I hate President Trump.
*  And I want to see him go to jail.
*  And I want to see him convicted.
*  So like the prosecution, the defense is putting a lot of emphasis on Michael Cohen,
*  reinforcing the idea that he's very essential to this trial.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there would be no dispute between the prosecution and the defense that Michael
*  Cohen has the key story here.
*  Okay.
*  So how does the defense and its opening argument?
*  Blanch ends in a very simple, straightforward way.
*  He asked the jurors to use their common sense.
*  And he says that if they decide the case based on the evidence, there will be a very
*  swift, not guilty verdict.
*  And he sits down and at this point it's just before noon.
*  And we're all looking at each other thinking, oh my gosh, opening statements in this
*  trial are already done.
*  We're going to get a witness.
*  Okay.
*  So take us into this very first witness.
*  So as you might imagine, witness sequence is incredibly important.
*  You're trying to tell the story you told in your opening through the testimony of
*  others.
*  And this is the prosecution witness.
*  So this is the first prosecution witness and it's David Pecker, the former publisher
*  of the National Enquirer.
*  And what is Pecker's testimony?
*  Pecker doesn't get too far into his story, but he does start to lay out the way that
*  the National Enquirer worked.
*  And one thing he says, and I think this is a bit of a problem for the defense, is he
*  says that the National Enquirer operated through quote unquote checkbook journalism.
*  And just explain that.
*  Which is a neat way of saying they paid people for stories.
*  But remember, we talked about this jury is highly educated.
*  There's a good chance they're quite media literate, media savvy.
*  They're going to know that this is not the way that normal newspapers operated.
*  And so this is a great thing for the prosecutors.
*  And this is why it's their witness already.
*  David Pecker is laying out a modus operandi at the National Enquirer.
*  That just isn't that normal.
*  And the day ends shortly after that.
*  But we can already see where Pecker is going when he returns to the stand on Tuesday.
*  He is going to describe how this form of quote unquote journalism, this checkbook
*  journalism, mattered to Trump and mattered in Trump's campaign.
*  And that's the way that prosecutors will begin to illustrate the story that they
*  told with opening statements.
*  And eventually what they hope that they'll have is this cast of characters, these
*  witnesses who will bring the conspiracy that they accused Donald Trump of
*  participating in to vivid life.
*  Jonah, we haven't talked much about Trump.
*  He's in the room this entire time.
*  He's sitting there at the defense table.
*  I'm curious if you or our colleagues captured any notable reactions from him.
*  I mean, after all, he's beginning the process of watching those he once entrusted
*  with helping him get elected.
*  Turn on him.
*  I've become used to seeing Trump minimized in the courtroom because he's just there
*  day after day because he's not the center of attention.
*  Right.
*  And I think that was really true today.
*  I can describe a couple of reactions.
*  For instance, he shook his head when prosecutors said he was guilty.
*  That was one of the main things that he did that caught our attention.
*  And then the thing that caught my eye is finally we're done for the day and Trump
*  stands up and he looks really angry.
*  He looks really, really angry.
*  And he walks out of court.
*  And this is what they try and take me off the trail for.
*  And he gives an angry speech.
*  With a familiar kind of language.
*  A tax on people, a tax on Cohen.
*  That is a witch hunt.
*  Thank you very much.
*  And then he gets in his SUV and he leaves the day in which prosecutors accused him
*  essentially to his face of committing 34 felonies.
*  Right.
*  Jonah, it would seem very hard to draw a lot of meaningful impressions from just
*  oral arguments, but in this single day, you have the prosecution and the defense
*  lawyer standing up and developing a rapport with the jury.
*  And introducing what they would regard as the strongest versions of their case.
*  And I'm kind of curious as a longtime court reporter, if you felt after today,
*  a strong sense of which team seems like it's a little bit more on top of their
*  game and is presenting a stronger version of events to the jury.
*  Or if it's just too early to say.
*  What I'll say is the prosecution has a very clear, very structured narrative.
*  The defense has a lot of things to say about that story and they're
*  picking off little elements.
*  They're saying, well, Cohen's a liar.
*  Stormy Daniels is an opportunist.
*  And by the way, there's no crime here.
*  There's no crime in terms of trying to win the election.
*  There's no crime in terms of falsifying any documents.
*  So those kind of individual blows that they're trying to land, one of them can
*  work or many of them could work.
*  What the defense didn't seem to have today was an alternative narrative.
*  And so of course, their burdens are different.
*  The defense is just trying to seed reasonable doubt.
*  The prosecution has to prove their case, but the prosecution is telling a story.
*  And the defense is saying that story's not quite right.
*  The defense is not necessarily telling a competing story.
*  Got it.
*  I want us to just end Jonah with a reminder of the stakes of this case, which
*  I think tend to get lost in the day to day coverage of it.
*  There are, as we've been talking about, 34 felony charges.
*  And this is the first criminal case to go to trial before the election.
*  And we think perhaps the only criminal case to go to trial before the election.
*  If Trump wins this case, it's quite clearly a huge vindication for him.
*  And he can go around saying as much.
*  If he loses, what are the actual legal consequences?
*  So the legal consequences, those are easy to talk about.
*  It's an indeterminate prison sentence, but we know it could be up to four years.
*  But the political consequences, which I think are of great interest to a lot of
*  people, are very, very difficult to talk about.
*  When Trump was indicted, his poll numbers actually went up.
*  Right.
*  And this was the first indictment.
*  That's right.
*  And so there's no clear indication that being convicted here would
*  necessarily hurt him politically.
*  I think a lot of people who dislike Trump were hoping that these criminal cases
*  would just kind of take him out of the picture.
*  But we don't know that that's going to happen.
*  And so even as we start to get into the heart of this case and hear the evidence
*  and hear the testimony and to see what the jurors are seeing and try and predict
*  whether Trump is going to be found guilty or not guilty, we still have no idea what
*  a conviction would actually mean or how it would affect the election.
*  Jonah, thank you very much.
*  Of course.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  During oral arguments on Monday, a majority of the Supreme Court appeared
*  ready to uphold a series of local laws that allowed grants pass a small city
*  in Oregon to ban homeless people from sleeping in public spaces.
*  The case, which was covered on Friday's episode of The Daily, has sweeping
*  implications for how the entire country deals with the growing crisis of homelessness.
*  And tensions over the war in Gaza are escalating on the campuses of
*  several elite universities.
*  At Yale and New York University, police on Monday arrested dozens of protesters
*  who defied orders to disperse.
*  At Harvard, administrators said they planned to close Harvard Yard to avoid
*  unauthorized demonstrations.
*  And at Columbia, where protesters have set up a large encampment, the
*  university's president faced calls to resign from all 10 House Republicans
*  from the state of New York.
*  In a letter, the Republicans wrote, quote,
*  Anarchy has engulfed the campus.
*  Today's episode was produced by Will Reed, Astha Chaturvedi, and Mujzadeh.
