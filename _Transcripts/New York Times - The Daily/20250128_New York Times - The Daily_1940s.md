*  Over the last few weeks, two Hollywood stars, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, have gone [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=19.0s)]
*  to battle over exactly what happened during the making and promotion of their latest film. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=24.1s)]
*  Blake Lively has filed a federal lawsuit claiming her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=29.68s)]
*  sexually harassed her. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=34.4s)]
*  Justin Baldoni is now suing his former co-star Blake Lively. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=36.08s)]
*  It's a dispute that's pulled back the curtain on an alleged smear campaign and the new set [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=40.32s)]
*  of tools that celebrities can use to defend themselves and redefine their enemies in the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  court of public opinion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  The tea is piping hot. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=53.08s)]
*  I mean, there's just so much currently being said about It Ends With Us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=54.68s)]
*  Today, my colleague Megan Toohey, on the legal complaint that started it all. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=59.44s)]
*  It's a mess, so let's get into it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=64.48s)]
*  It's Tuesday, January 28th. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=70.92s)]
*  Megan, welcome back to the show. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=74.84s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=79.16s)]
*  So, you have broken and covered some of the biggest stories of sexual harassment in Hollywood, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=80.16s)]
*  Your latest article has generated an extraordinary amount of attention, even for you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  And I have to confess to being pretty read in on this one, it has been difficult to avoid [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  the online conversation around it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  And it all began with this story that you wrote. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=99.36s)]
*  Tell me how you came to that story. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=102.84s)]
*  So in December, Blake Lively, the movie star, filed a legal complaint. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=105.16s)]
*  It was made with the California Civil Rights Agency. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=110.36s)]
*  And it is a formal complaint against Justin Baldoni, her co-star and the director of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=114.76s)]
*  latest hit movie that she just made. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=121.0s)]
*  It Ends With Us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=123.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=124.08s)]
*  Who she says sexually harassed her. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=125.08s)]
*  And what's particularly interesting to us was the information that forms the foundation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=127.76s)]
*  of the filing, which are excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=132.68s)]
*  Lively's team acquired through a subpoena. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=139.6s)]
*  In them, in these documents, Baldoni and his publicists orchestrated what Lively describes [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=142.64s)]
*  as a modern day smear campaign. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=149.48s)]
*  What she said was a coordinated push to tank her reputation out of fear that her allegations [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  may come to light. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  And what really interested me and my colleagues, Mike McIntyre and Julie Tate, in this complaint [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=161.16s)]
*  and in what it purported to show, is not just how to protect someone's reputation, but how [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=167.16s)]
*  to harm someone else's. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=173.8s)]
*  That's the alleged smear campaign. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=178.28s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=179.28s)]
*  Let's talk about the campaign as described in the filing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=180.28s)]
*  Where does that story start? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=182.88s)]
*  It starts with the filming of It Ends With Us. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=185.52s)]
*  What is this place going to be? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  A flower shop. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=191.12s)]
*  The movie is about this young woman chasing her dream of opening a flower shop who falls [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  in love with this seemingly perfect guy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  What do you do for a living? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  Arrowsurgeon. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=202.76s)]
*  I'm terrible. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=203.76s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=204.76s)]
*  I thought you were a crypto-pro. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=205.76s)]
*  But as the relationship progresses, he becomes physically abusive. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=210.28s)]
*  He just looked at me. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=217.28s)]
*  He promised me, Lily. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=219.28s)]
*  He knew he was coming. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=220.28s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=221.28s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=222.8s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=223.8s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=224.8s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=225.8s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=226.8s)]
*  Stop. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=227.8s)]
*  The film was based on a novel by Colleen Hoover, one of the most popular novelists today. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=228.8s)]
*  Yes, I know her. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=234.24s)]
*  I think I've seen her books a million times at the airport, for example. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=235.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, of course. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=238.4s)]
*  There was actually huge anticipation for the movie rights because of how many Hoover fans [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=240.4s)]
*  there are out there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=245.88s)]
*  A studio called Wayfarer eventually gained the rights. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=248.0s)]
*  And Baldoni, who is also co-chair and co-founder of the studio, called it an act of providence [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=252.24s)]
*  for him to get to direct the film. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=258.84s)]
*  So this is something he's really excited about. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=261.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=263.72s)]
*  It was right up his alley. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=264.72s)]
*  He had gotten his start as an actor on the show Jane the Virgin. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=267.0s)]
*  But in recent years, he'd become a very vocal critic of toxic masculinity. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=272.14s)]
*  Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life and actually believe them, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=279.26s)]
*  even if what they're saying is against you? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=286.21999999999997s)]
*  He hosted a TED Talk. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=288.34s)]
*  Will you actually stand up and do something so that one day we don't have to live in a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=289.94s)]
*  world where a woman has to risk everything and come forward to say the words, me too? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=293.82s)]
*  He wrote multiple books on the topic. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=299.98s)]
*  Final question. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=302.38s)]
*  Why did you, after reading my book for the first time, look at me? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=303.88s)]
*  We were in bed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=308.58s)]
*  Look at me and say, babe, you need to read your own book. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=310.82s)]
*  And he also co-hosted a podcast called Man Enough. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=315.14s)]
*  Because you're still doing that journey that you talk about in the book, the journey from [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=319.3s)]
*  your head to your heart. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=322.5s)]
*  So this movie, which is about, yes, it's about domestic violence, but is also about ending [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=327.14s)]
*  the cycle of abuse and uplifting women, is a good fit for him to tell. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=333.14s)]
*  So he signed on to direct and he casts as his co-star Blake Lively, this popular actress, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=338.86s)]
*  wife of Ryan Reynolds, friend of Taylor Swift. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=347.78s)]
*  Big star. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=351.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=352.18s)]
*  A lot is coming together that would seem to put this project on a path to success. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=353.18s)]
*  But then, according to her complaint, when filming begins, a number of incidents happen [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=359.54s)]
*  that make her uncomfortable. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=366.06s)]
*  Like what, for example? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=368.08s)]
*  So the complaint says that Baldoni wanted to add some sex scenes to the movie that she [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=369.78000000000003s)]
*  felt were gratuitous. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=374.18s)]
*  She also alleges that he improvised unwanted kissing, discussed his sex life with her, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=376.38s)]
*  and entered her trailer without permission while she was breastfeeding. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=383.18s)]
*  And she also has made allegations against one of the film's lead producers, Jamie Heath, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=387.94s)]
*  who is the CEO of the studio, Wayfarer. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=394.38s)]
*  And Lively says that Heath also entered her trailer when she was breastfeeding, watched [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=398.38s)]
*  her when she was topless and having body makeup removed despite her asking him to look away, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=403.14s)]
*  and showed her a video of his wife naked during childbirth. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=408.86s)]
*  And she alleges that both men also discussed pornography with her. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=413.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=416.9s)]
*  So what does she do in response? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=417.9s)]
*  Well, in the midst of filming, there was a writer's strike, which put a pause on things. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=419.98s)]
*  And Lively used that pause to try to fix some of the issues that she said she had experienced [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=426.54s)]
*  on set and actually said she wouldn't come back to set unless they met certain conditions. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=432.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=438.65999999999997s)]
*  So according to Lively's complaint, there are a number of things on set that make this [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  situation unworkable. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  What are the conditions that she asks for to deal with them? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=447.29999999999995s)]
*  So one was a full-time intimacy coordinator to be with her on the set at all times, like [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  not just during intimate scenes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=460.66s)]
*  And another was no more unwanted comments or discussion about sex. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=463.5s)]
*  And she also asked them not to retaliate against her for raising these issues or requesting [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  these safeguards. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=475.46000000000004s)]
*  And Wayfair agrees to all these conditions, writing that, I'll quote here, although our [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=477.78000000000003s)]
*  perspective differs in many aspects, ensuring a safe environment for all is paramount. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  Now Baldoni and Heath are now disputing her claims of misconduct and saying that they [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=490.38s)]
*  only agree to the terms because they feared that Lively would pull out of the movie and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=494.8s)]
*  it would fall apart. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=500.3s)]
*  But yeah, at the time they agreed and filming continued. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=501.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=505.42s)]
*  So Lively gets the conditions that she asks for. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=506.46s)]
*  How do those work out in the end? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=510.28s)]
*  Well, you know, that's interesting. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=512.62s)]
*  Lively says that when they return to work, Baldoni's behavior improved with these new [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=515.46s)]
*  protections in place. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=521.96s)]
*  It kind of sounds like the situation was handled relatively well in the end. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=524.02s)]
*  I mean, she asks for certain things to happen, they happen, and according to her, the situation [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=528.4200000000001s)]
*  on set is better. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=535.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=536.1s)]
*  I mean, I think that by her account, this was like a situation of problem identified, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=537.1s)]
*  everybody moves on. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=544.06s)]
*  But while she doesn't have any other allegations of misconduct, once they come back to finish [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=546.22s)]
*  making the movie, they do end up having major creative differences. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=552.02s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=557.38s)]
*  So Baldoni does an edit of the movie one way, but Lively did her own edit. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=558.38s)]
*  And in the end, Sony, the distributor of the film, supports her version. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=564.7s)]
*  As the premiere approaches, the public starts to pick up on indications that there had been [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=571.46s)]
*  some drama behind the scenes. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=576.5s)]
*  You know, Lively and some other cast members had unfollowed Baldoni on Instagram. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=579.42s)]
*  Fans wondered, like, why was that? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=584.86s)]
*  Then Lively, the cast, and Hoover did not do any appearances alongside Baldoni. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=587.54s)]
*  And it seemed increasingly apparent that something had gone wrong. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=594.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=598.7s)]
*  In the Instagram world, being unfollowed, you couldn't get a more obvious sign of a [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=600.5400000000001s)]
*  disagreement than that. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=604.0200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=605.58s)]
*  And as speculation grows and people start asking more and more questions, according [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=606.58s)]
*  to the text messages, Baldoni is getting more and more worried. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=612.22s)]
*  He's concerned that the allegations that Lively had made against him during the filming of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=617.38s)]
*  the movie could now become public. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=621.82s)]
*  So by the first week of August, he makes a move. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=625.86s)]
*  He hires a crisis PR firm. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=630.4599999999999s)]
*  Megan, in my reporting, I'm used to people hiring crisis PR firms to deal with a corporate [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=632.9s)]
*  crisis or a political problem. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=638.54s)]
*  In this case, I'm assuming the function is essentially the same. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=641.54s)]
*  I mean, you're hiring a crisis PR firm to avert a reputational crisis. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=644.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=651.3399999999999s)]
*  In this case, he hired a PR firm led by a woman named Melissa Nathan. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=652.98s)]
*  And she's worked with a variety of high-profile clients, including Johnny Depp, who was accused [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=660.14s)]
*  of physical abuse, as you may recall, by his ex-wife, Amber Heard. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=667.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=672.1s)]
*  And Nathan, as soon as she comes on, presents Baldoni with an initial strategic plan that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=673.1s)]
*  included backchanneling with journalists to try to push positive messaging about him [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=680.1s)]
*  and defend against any negative stories that might arise. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=685.98s)]
*  But the text messages included in Lively's complaint, which we reviewed, suggest that [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=691.1800000000001s)]
*  Baldoni wanted to go further. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=698.7s)]
*  Can you just read me some of this? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=701.1800000000001s)]
*  Because I think a lot of what we're going to be talking about here are about the internal [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=702.66s)]
*  communications that are going on. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  And I just think it would be useful to hear some of these messages. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=708.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=711.74s)]
*  So Baldoni wrote in a text message to a publicist, not in love with the document they sent, not [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=712.74s)]
*  sure I'm feeling the protection I felt on the call. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=720.8199999999999s)]
*  And after receiving that message, the publicist texted Nathan, saying, I think you guys need [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=725.62s)]
*  to be tough and show the strength of what you guys can do in these scenarios. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=732.06s)]
*  He wants to feel like she, meaning Lively, can be buried. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=736.9s)]
*  And the text message back from Nathan is, of course. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=742.6999999999999s)]
*  But you know when we send over documents, we can't send over the work we will or could [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=746.66s)]
*  do because that could get us in a lot of trouble. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=750.98s)]
*  We can't write, we will destroy her. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=754.3s)]
*  And Nathan wrote, imagine if a document saying all the things that he wants ends up in the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=757.24s)]
*  wrong hands. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  Nathan added, you know we can bury anyone. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=764.52s)]
*  Wow, that's pretty strong. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=767.36s)]
*  Yeah, and a few days later, Baldoni texted his PR team a social media thread that accused [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=769.84s)]
*  a female celebrity of being a bully. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=776.84s)]
*  And this thread had something like 19 billion views. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=780.4s)]
*  And he writes, this is what we would need. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=783.92s)]
*  So in these texts, in the complaint, you do see a shift from just protecting Baldoni's [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  reputation to potentially targeting Blake Lively, going after her. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=793.74s)]
*  Yes, and soon these text messages show Nathan presented a plan for how to do that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=799.34s)]
*  And it would involve hiring digital contractors to dominate social media through, quote, full [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=808.14s)]
*  social takedowns and by starting, quote, threads of theories. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=815.92s)]
*  You know, there's also a reference to the, quote, creation of social fan engagement to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=821.48s)]
*  go back and forth with any negative accounts, helping to change narrative and stay on track. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=827.58s)]
*  All that is sort of jargony, but it sounds like what's being discussed is a proposal [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=834.88s)]
*  for an all-out push on social media to take control of the public narrative here, you [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=839.74s)]
*  know, intervening in the online conversations about Lively and Baldoni and influencing it [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=846.08s)]
*  specifically to benefit Baldoni and to hurt Lively. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=852.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=856.08s)]
*  And Nathan writes, all of this will be, most importantly, untraceable. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=857.7s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=863.78s)]
*  So, Megan, what did this plan, which was supposed to be untraceable, actually look like, what [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=881.28s)]
*  it was put into action? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=887.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, they hired a digital contractor who offers crisis management services. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=888.58s)]
*  His name is Jed Wallace, and there's actually very little trace of him online. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=894.98s)]
*  But in a deleted LinkedIn profile, he described himself as a, quote, hired gun with a proprietary [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=901.22s)]
*  formula for defining artists and trends. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=908.9s)]
*  And court records show that his clients have included Paramount Pictures and YouTube celebrity [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=913.0799999999999s)]
*  Aiden Ross. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=919.12s)]
*  Other than that, we don't actually know that much about him. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=920.88s)]
*  But in the documents included in Lively's complaint, there are references in emails [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  to, quote, social manipulation and, quote, proactive fan posting. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=930.72s)]
*  Text messages cite efforts to boost and amplify online content that was favorable to Baldoni [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=937.46s)]
*  and critical of Lively. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=945.66s)]
*  Okay, so this sounds in keeping with the kinds of things they had outlined in their plan [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=947.66s)]
*  to Baldoni. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=952.74s)]
*  What does that actually involve? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=954.46s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=956.32s)]
*  We can't be sure. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=957.32s)]
*  But last August, after the film premieres, instead of the negative press that Baldoni [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=959.62s)]
*  feared, there was a flood of negative press and comments online about Blake Lively. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=965.54s)]
*  And what does that criticism say? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=974.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, the official promotion plan for the movie instructed the cast to focus more on [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=975.88s)]
*  the uplifting aspects of the movie. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=980.4s)]
*  Hello, Blake Lively here. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=982.76s)]
*  Colleen Hoover. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=984.4s)]
*  And It Ends With Us is in theaters now, so grab your friends, wear your florals, and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=985.4599999999999s)]
*  head out to see it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=990.4399999999999s)]
*  To embrace a floral theme, you know, her character owns a flower shop. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=991.9s)]
*  I'm seeing Blake Lively in a whole new light. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=996.34s)]
*  She is so tone deaf, honestly. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=998.8s)]
*  And Lively got criticized for appearing to ignore one of the movie's main subjects. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1000.98s)]
*  She really did with all seriousness say, like, grab your florals, grab your besties, and [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1006.96s)]
*  sit down to enjoy this movie. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1011.68s)]
*  And the movie's about domestic violence. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1013.78s)]
*  In several appearances, Lively never even made reference to domestic violence at all. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1017.8s)]
*  You guys, we talked about our movie, not at all. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1022.1999999999999s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1024.04s)]
*  In theaters August 9th. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1025.04s)]
*  She faced additional criticism when her Betty Booze alcoholic beverage company promoted [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1026.56s)]
*  the film, given the role that alcohol can play in abusive relationships. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1031.56s)]
*  Like are you promoting a film, or are you promoting yourself? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1036.04s)]
*  Some real potential missteps here. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1040.44s)]
*  Certainly that's how they were being publicly received. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1043.16s)]
*  And you know, according to Lively's legal complaint and numerous text messages, when [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1045.8999999999999s)]
*  Baldoni's team saw this, they decided that Baldoni would make domestic violence a focus [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1051.74s)]
*  of his interviews and social media. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1058.06s)]
*  The one thing you want people to take away from this project, what would you say? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1060.6599999999999s)]
*  Hope. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1064.1399999999999s)]
*  And that everybody has the ability to end a cycle that they didn't ask for. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1065.1399999999999s)]
*  We can all say it ends with us in our life. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1071.62s)]
*  You know, clearly some of this criticism is organic, but as this backlash is gaining [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1075.84s)]
*  momentum, we see in the text that Baldoni's PR people are taking credit for the online [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1085.62s)]
*  narrative. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1094.02s)]
*  There's one text from a PR person that reads, we've started to see a shift on social, due [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1095.02s)]
*  largely to Jed and his team's efforts to shift the narrative towards shining a spotlight [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1102.1s)]
*  on Blake and Ryan. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1107.76s)]
*  And according to Lively's complaint, Baldoni himself took an active role in this process. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1110.02s)]
*  I mean, text messages show that he encouraged the PR team, sometimes flagging social media [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1116.9199999999998s)]
*  posts for amplifying. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1123.28s)]
*  On August 15th, he actually proposes, quote, flipping the narrative on a positive story [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1125.84s)]
*  about Lively and Reynolds by, quote, using their own words against them. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1131.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, at other times in these text messages, Baldoni appears to worry that his team is [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1136.62s)]
*  going too far, and he seeks assurances that he won't be implicated in the backlash. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1142.56s)]
*  For example, when he notices a tabloid article critical of Lively, he sends a worried text, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1149.1399999999999s)]
*  quote, how can we say somehow that we are not doing any of this? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1154.94s)]
*  It looks like we are trying to take her down. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1158.8s)]
*  And on another occasion, he wondered whether his team was deploying fake bot accounts on [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1161.96s)]
*  social media. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1167.44s)]
*  And Nathan writes, I can fully confirm we do not have bots. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1169.16s)]
*  And she adds that any digital team would be too intelligent to, quote, utilize something [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1174.24s)]
*  so obvious. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1179.92s)]
*  Jed Wallace's operation, she wrote, quote, is doing something very specific in terms [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1181.96s)]
*  of what they do. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1187.26s)]
*  I know Jamie and Jed connected on this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1188.82s)]
*  Okay, so you see Baldoni kind of vacillating. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1192.02s)]
*  You see Nathan responding. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1195.78s)]
*  But, Megan, do we know actually whether the online backlash against Lively is the result [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1197.74s)]
*  of these, quote, very specific things that the team is doing? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1204.7s)]
*  We don't. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1209.16s)]
*  It's difficult to know how much of the backlash was authentic and how much they might have [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1210.28s)]
*  seeded and amplified the discussion. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1216.64s)]
*  What we do know is that in addition to the backlash against Lively, by the end of the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1220.78s)]
*  movie's promotional run, there was also a very strong pro-Justin narrative online, which [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1226.0600000000002s)]
*  Baldoni's team was celebrating. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1231.8400000000001s)]
*  Describe that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1234.98s)]
*  Once one PR person texts Melissa Nathan, quote, the narrative online is so freaking good and [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1235.98s)]
*  fans are still sticking up for Justin. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1242.64s)]
*  You did such amazing work, she writes. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1245.44s)]
*  And Nathan replies, narrative is crazy good. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1248.88s)]
*  The majority of socials are so pro-Justin and I don't even agree with half of them. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1252.64s)]
*  LOL. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1257.88s)]
*  When you reached out to them, to the Baldoni team, what did they say about all this? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1259.44s)]
*  So before the story was published, we contacted them and we detailed each allegation, item [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1265.8799999999999s)]
*  by item, so they could respond to each point and told them that we needed to hear back [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1272.9599999999998s)]
*  within 14 hours. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1279.52s)]
*  Standard operating practice for stories like this, the no surprises email. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1281.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1285.52s)]
*  And less than two hours later, we got a statement prepared by a lawyer that said the story was [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1286.52s)]
*  false, denying that a smear campaign existed and broadly denying the allegations and [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1293.4s)]
*  liveliest complaint. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1299.74s)]
*  Baldoni and his team did not address specific allegations, text messages and other documents [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1301.74s)]
*  referenced in the story. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1307.14s)]
*  They did not agree to interviews, nor did they provide any additional information. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1308.8600000000001s)]
*  Then 10 days after our story was published, Baldoni and his associates filed a legal complaint [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1315.18s)]
*  against the New York Times. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1322.24s)]
*  Let's talk about that lawsuit. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1324.44s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1326.5s)]
*  The lawsuit takes on two issues. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1327.5600000000002s)]
*  First is the alleged smear campaign and second, Lively's allegations of misconduct during [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1331.1200000000001s)]
*  filming. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  Baldoni's team continues to deny that a smear campaign ever took place and they accuse Lively [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1340.5800000000002s)]
*  and the Times of cherry picking or misrepresenting text messages to suggest that it did. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1347.22s)]
*  What do they mean by cherry picking? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1353.68s)]
*  The lawsuit, for example, signals out one text exchange between the PR people, which [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1355.38s)]
*  we quoted in the story, in which they appear to take credit for a negative article about [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1361.16s)]
*  Lively that was published last summer. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1366.3600000000001s)]
*  Baldoni's team says other parts of the exchange indicate that it was sarcastic and showed [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1369.48s)]
*  they were not really taking credit for the article. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1374.66s)]
*  This is something his supporters have really seized on online, right? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1378.3000000000002s)]
*  They also claim that this exchange between the PR people was Lively's only evidence of [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1383.1000000000001s)]
*  a smear campaign. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1389.66s)]
*  As you just heard, that wasn't the extent of it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1391.94s)]
*  Her complaint in our story referenced many text messages and other documents. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1395.14s)]
*  We should say for listeners that before this interview, the team at The Daily got an official [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1401.14s)]
*  statement on this lawsuit from the New York Times company. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1405.8600000000001s)]
*  It says that the Times stands by the story, saying it was meticulously and responsibly [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1409.76s)]
*  reported and that the company plans to quote, vigorously defend against the suit. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1414.96s)]
*  So Megan, how did Baldoni's legal team respond to the second issue, Lively's allegations [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1421.6000000000001s)]
*  of sexual harassment during filming? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1427.0800000000002s)]
*  Here they don't deny that Lively made allegations during shooting and that Wayfair agreed to [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1429.84s)]
*  accommodate her requests. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1436.0s)]
*  Instead they are disputing her characterization of events and taking aim at her credibility. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1438.76s)]
*  So for example, they cite a text message that she sent Baldoni in which she said, I'm pumping [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1445.08s)]
*  in my trailer if you want to work on lines to suggest that this means she wouldn't have [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1452.28s)]
*  minded if he saw her breastfeeding. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1457.5s)]
*  They don't say whether he did come to her trailer at that time or if he did, whether [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1460.18s)]
*  she continued to pump in front of him. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1465.2s)]
*  In effect, Wayfair is saying, yes, we made accommodations to Lively on set, but they [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1467.46s)]
*  weren't because of any underlying wrongdoing on our part. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1472.38s)]
*  Yes, and they're also saying that Lively made the allegations as a way to wrest control [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1476.54s)]
*  of the movie away from Baldoni and his production company. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1482.7s)]
*  They say that all of this was a power grab and that her legal complaint was part of a [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1485.84s)]
*  smear campaign that she's been waging against him. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1490.32s)]
*  Megan, after all this, this whole discussion that we've had, I feel genuinely confused [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1493.6799999999998s)]
*  about what to think here. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1499.32s)]
*  And I'm also keenly aware that this has been about public narratives and public perceptions [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1502.1s)]
*  all along. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1508.26s)]
*  So where do we stand with that tug of war over narratives now? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1509.84s)]
*  So after Lively filed her legal complaint against Baldoni and our story came out, there [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1515.3s)]
*  was an outpouring of support for her. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1522.8s)]
*  But since that time, Baldoni has gone on the offensive. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1526.8999999999999s)]
*  He is being represented by a well-known Hollywood lawyer named Brian Friedman, who has been [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1531.94s)]
*  very aggressive in defending his client. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1538.44s)]
*  He has attacked Lively and the New York Times in multiple press interviews and has released [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1541.98s)]
*  a flood of information that he says proves that Baldoni is the real victim here. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1548.9s)]
*  Last week, for example, a scene was leaked from filming of the movie. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1555.22s)]
*  And it was a scene where Baldoni and Lively were dancing together and talking. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1560.22s)]
*  And Lively said that his behavior in this moment was an example of him being inappropriate. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1564.8s)]
*  And Baldoni's team said that it shows he did nothing wrong. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1571.26s)]
*  Yeah, I watched the video and read a lot of commentary about it. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1574.42s)]
*  And what was striking to me was just how differently people were interpreting what it actually [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1579.3s)]
*  proved. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1585.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and all of this, the video, the interviews, is getting nonstop coverage in the tabloids [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1586.1000000000001s)]
*  and entertainment publications. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1595.74s)]
*  And it's being sliced and diced and spread on social media. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1597.86s)]
*  And as I've watched all this unfold, I keep thinking of an exchange that was actually [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1602.94s)]
*  cited in Lively's legal complaint between two of Baldoni's publicists as they were working [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1609.3s)]
*  on their campaign last summer. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1617.06s)]
*  One of the publicists wrote, quote, So are we in the clear now? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1619.74s)]
*  Did we survive? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1624.54s)]
*  And Melissa Nathan responded, We survived. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1626.56s)]
*  All press is so overwhelming. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1630.74s)]
*  We've confused people. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1632.94s)]
*  So much mixed messaging. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1634.74s)]
*  It's actually really funny if you think about it. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1636.96s)]
*  Why is that stuck in your mind? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1639.78s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1641.3s)]
*  Well, Natalie, you are obviously not the only one confused. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1643.58s)]
*  It seems like, at least according to these messages that were cited in her legal complaint, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1649.6200000000001s)]
*  the mixing of messages, confusing people, that was the goal. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1656.58s)]
*  Megan, after spending all of this time looking deep into this story and this alleged smear [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1662.5s)]
*  campaign, seeing the responses from both sides, the debates about the responses, what's your [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1669.1000000000001s)]
*  takeaway from all this? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1675.82s)]
*  You know, when our story was published, I got a ton of response from people saying how [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1677.84s)]
*  eye-opening this was, even among people in Hollywood who say they had never seen anything [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1686.24s)]
*  like this before. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1692.24s)]
*  And I think the fact that this kind of thing is happening or can happen, the kind of campaign [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1694.4399999999998s)]
*  that Lively's complaint and these text messages purport to show, speaks to what might be a [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1700.08s)]
*  next phase in claims of harassment or misconduct. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1707.44s)]
*  How so? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1713.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, over the years, we've seen what these allegations can mean for someone's reputation, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1714.8400000000001s)]
*  for someone's career, like how utterly damaging they can be. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1722.3600000000001s)]
*  And now we are also seeing the lengths that people will go to protect their reputations [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1726.72s)]
*  and their livelihoods and the new tools that are available to them. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1738.72s)]
*  And so in your mind, it sounds like the very existence of a campaign like the one alleged [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1739.72s)]
*  in the complaint that uses these new tactics and tools to prevent reputational damage, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1745.14s)]
*  that's what's most significant here. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1752.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1754.04s)]
*  This is really only a glimpse behind the curtain. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1755.6s)]
*  There's a lot more for us to look into and try to figure out about exactly how these [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1763.94s)]
*  tools work and who is using them. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1770.1s)]
*  And I think it would actually be a mistake to think that this is limited, that these [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1774.24s)]
*  kind of strategies are limited just to Hollywood or to me too. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1778.36s)]
*  If this much effort was expended over the two stars of this movie, it makes you wonder [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1783.8s)]
*  how these strategies are being applied in other realms by politicians, by governments, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1790.0s)]
*  by business executives. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1796.6s)]
*  So I think this story raises broader questions about just how much of what we consume online [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1801.7s)]
*  is being manipulated to serve one interest or another. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1809.72s)]
*  Megan, thank you so much. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1819.72s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1822.08s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1834.36s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1839.56s)]
*  A jolt of panic hit technology stocks on Monday after the debut of a chatbot from the Chinese [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1848.24s)]
*  company DeepSeek. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1853.6s)]
*  DeepSeek's models appear to rival those from OpenAI, Google, and Meta, and the company [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1855.6s)]
*  says it created its chatbot with a small fraction of the specialized computer chips that its [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1861.04s)]
*  American competitors use. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1866.1599999999999s)]
*  The biggest hit in the selloff was chipmaker Nvidia, which dropped nearly 17% and lost [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1869.36s)]
*  roughly $600 billion in market value. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1875.08s)]
*  The assumption in the tech industry was that in order to build bigger and better AI systems, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1878.9199999999998s)]
*  companies would have to spend billions on new data centers that relied on Nvidia's [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1885.32s)]
*  chips, an assumption that DeepSeek has potentially upended. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rez0Li1n0XE&t=1890.12s)]
