# The Doping Scandal Rocking the Upcoming Olympics
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRVI2wpl_48)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff. This is The Daily.
*  A new doping scandal is rocking the world of competitive swimming as the Paris Olympics
*  approach. Those allegations are raising questions about fairness in the sport and whether we
*  can trust what we see at these summer games. Today, one of the reporters who broke that
*  story, Mike Schmidt, explains the controversy and what it reveals about the struggle to
*  police doping in sports.
*  It's Thursday, June 27th.
*  Mike, on Tuesday, we saw two stars of American swimming testify before Congress, where they
*  questioned the fairness of their own sport and of the Olympic Games. This was a pretty
*  remarkable moment. Tell me about what happened.
*  Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, good evening. My name is Michael Phelps and I come
*  before you.
*  Michael Phelps, the most well-known swimmer probably in American history.
*  Thank you for this opportunity to address to you today on a matter of crucial importance
*  as we approach the 2024 Olympic Games.
*  And Allison Schmidt, one of the most accomplished female swimmers in American history, went
*  up to Capitol Hill to essentially say they had lost complete faith in the system that
*  is supposed to ensure that there's a level playing field when you sit down and watch
*  Olympic athletes compete.
*  And they started their argument by telling the story of what it's been like to be them.
*  Now, there are times where I would be blood and urine tested twice a day. They could be
*  within a 30-minute window. They're taking four to six vials of blood every time they
*  test.
*  To be Olympic athletes who gave basically all of their privacy over to a drug testing
*  system.
*  I'm filling out forms to update our whereabouts every hour of the day.
*  Where their whereabouts was always known so a drug tester could find them.
*  Pulling our pants down below our knees, pulling our shirts up to our breasts and having them
*  watch the pee come out.
*  And where it was so invasive that they had to urinate directly in front of a tester.
*  I knew at 17 years old, 16 years old, that I was signing my privacy and my rights away
*  for fair sport and clean sport.
*  They're basically saying, look, in the hopes and dreams of their being fair sport, they
*  would play by the rules and wouldn't use drugs they weren't supposed to, but would also
*  essentially open their lives up to drug testers.
*  And Mike, if I understand it correctly, part of the reason they're so enraged is that they
*  say this isn't happening everywhere. Other countries aren't doing this.
*  They're saying the more that we learn about how this system works around the world, the
*  more that we learn that not everyone is being held to the standard that we were held to.
*  There is a stat back in 2016 when I was swimming that I had over 150 drug tests during that
*  year.
*  There were other delegations as a whole that were having 30 or 40.
*  Because of that, how can we trust anything that we see that goes on at the Olympics?
*  And honestly, I think if we continue to let this slide any farther, the Olympic Games
*  might not even be there.
*  Okay, so why now? Why are they coming to Congress and saying this right now?
*  These decorated swimmers were up on Capitol Hill because of a story my colleague Tarik
*  Panja and I wrote two months ago.
*  The story begins at the height of the pandemic. It was early 2021. The Summer Olympics were
*  just a couple of months away. And the Chinese Swimming Association wanted to hold a meet
*  to essentially allow their swimmers who had been training in seclusion to practice competition.
*  So all of the elite Chinese swimmers congregated in the same city south of Beijing. And there,
*  over several days, they swam against each other. The swimmers, like they normally are
*  at major meets, were being drug tested. But what no one knew was that 23 out of the 39
*  athletes who were tested showed that they all had the same performance enhancing drug
*  in their system.
*  That's a lot of positives. I mean, 23 out of 39 is more than half of everyone tested.
*  It's a staggering number. And it's all for the same drug. A drug called Trimatazidine.
*  It's known as TMZ. It's a prescription heart medication used to treat people that have
*  chest pains, that have angina. It's supposed to make the heart work more efficiently and
*  allow those with heart disease to exert themselves in ways that they're often unable to.
*  So this helps for training.
*  Correct. This drug is popular amongst dopers for several reasons. It allows you to train
*  harder. And if you train harder, that means that you will be in better shape and more
*  capable when you finally get to a competition. It's also attractive because it quickly clears
*  through an athlete's system. So if an athlete is trying to find a window between drug tests
*  to use a drug, this would be a good one because it's not going to stay in your system for
*  too, too long.
*  And Mike, I'm assuming this drug then is on the banned substances list. It's penalized
*  harshly.
*  The drug is classified in the highest level of substances that can help an athlete. If
*  you have any amount of it in your system, you're potentially on the hook for a four-year
*  ban. So for the Chinese, this was a nightmare scenario. It's just months before the Summer
*  Olympics, and you're looking at the possibility of essentially half of your swimming team
*  not being able to go to the games because they were doping.
*  Okay. So what happens? What do they do?
*  So the Chinese engaged in a wide-scale investigation and scientific research effort to find out
*  what happened. And we know this because we've obtained a lengthy secret Chinese document
*  that lays out how they investigated the positive tests. They brought in the top law enforcement
*  agency in the country to investigate it. And they said that a couple of months after the
*  athletes tested positive, investigators found trace amounts of TMZ in the kitchen of a hotel
*  where the athletes were fed. They say that this prescription heart drug was found in
*  spice containers in the hospital.
*  Okay. So what happened? What happened?
*  This drug was found in spice containers in the hood over the grill and in the drainage.
*  So the Chinese anti-doping agency finds that all of these swimmers test positive for this
*  drug that should prompt suspension. But instead of suspending them, they say these swimmers
*  tested positive because of contamination, not because they were intentionally doping
*  to improve their performance.
*  The Chinese say that this was evidence that the athletes had been contaminated with the
*  drug. And because of this explanation, we are not going to discipline the swimmers.
*  But what the Chinese are unable to explain is how the drug got into the kitchen and why
*  it was there.
*  It sounds like there's a lot that is unexplained in all of this. I mean, the entire theory
*  seems a little questionable.
*  There are contamination cases and there are drugs that sometimes end up in food because
*  they're given to cows and athletes eat the cows and it's in their system. TMZ is not
*  one of those drugs. This is a prescription heart medication. And the Chinese are unable
*  to explain why a prescription heart medication ended up in a kitchen or how the athletes
*  even ingested it.
*  And under the code that is supposed to govern Olympic athletes, you can have what are called
*  essentially no fault contaminations in which an athlete is not penalized for testing positive
*  for a drug. But to do that, you essentially need to prove exactly how it happened. And
*  the Chinese explanation, according to anti-doping experts who looked at this and studied it,
*  doesn't rise to that level. And not to hit you over the head with more inside doping
*  code minutiae. Under the way the system is supposed to work, each country is supposed
*  to police their own athletes. If those countries fail to do that properly, the world anti-doping
*  agency, this entity that is supposed to ensure the level playing field in Olympic sports
*  is supposed to step in and essentially take over and prosecute the case to make sure that
*  the rules are followed and that athletes are properly disciplined.
*  Okay, so what do they do in this case?
*  In this case, the world anti-doping agency essentially comes in, looks at the Chinese
*  explanation and accepts the rationale that these athletes were contaminated by the Chinese
*  drug with this prescription heart drug. And without anyone knowing, these swimmers who
*  tested positive head to the 2021 Olympics and have some of the greatest success in Chinese
*  swimming history. A male swimmer who had tested positive for TMZ becomes the second man in
*  Chinese history to win a gold in swimming. A female swimmer who had tested positive won
*  two gold medals and one silver. And the most dramatic example comes in the women's four
*  by 200 relay race.
*  China up for the challenge. Time to cross the Chinese team, they're the Asian Games
*  champions. Two of the four swimmers on the Chinese team had tested positive for TMZ.
*  For the United States, Alison Schmidt, who testified on Capitol Hill, is the first swimmer
*  in the water. For much of the race, China and Australia are neck and neck.
*  But the Australian still can't shake off the attentions of the women's four by 200.
*  For much of the race, China and Australia are neck and neck.
*  But the Australian still can't shake off the attentions of China. Zhang is remaining tough
*  and what a way to do it. 200 flying, even coming back on the Australians now.
*  But then, while Ledecky is racing in the water for the USA, the USA could steal this whole
*  thing with Ledecky now. In the final leg, Kate Ledecky, the greatest female swimmer of her
*  generation, gets in the water and closes the distance.
*  I think we may have a change of leader when it comes to the 50 meters to go mark. China
*  just hanging on. Ledecky, what has she got left? She loves to race for the stars and stripes.
*  Look at that underwater. This is a wild finish at the end of the women's four by 200 freestyle.
*  China have broken Australia, but Katie Ledecky on the charge. And as it comes down the stretch,
*  the United States pulls into second.
*  Fast finishing, Katie Ledecky is giving everything to this final. And in the final moments,
*  with five meters to go, can China hang on? As the swimmers are approaching the wall,
*  China's strike goal, just in front of the United States. It's a new world record. Of course it is.
*  A Chinese swimmer hits the wall first by less than half a second, giving China the goal
*  and the United States the silver.
*  And what a swim from the Americans. You write them off at your peril.
*  But that's what it means to China. A world record, a huge world record, 740.33.
*  And their first gold medal in the four by 200 freestyle relay at the Olympic Games. What a team.
*  I honestly have chills hearing this. I mean, this is an extremely tight race, which we're now learning
*  based on your reporting, was potentially fundamentally unfair.
*  And as Phelps and Schmidt said when they testified before Congress, all of this calls into question
*  the larger system. Was the system that was supposed to ensure that athletes were all competing
*  on the same playing field, was that functioning? Was this a race in which athletes were showing
*  their natural abilities or that something else was at play?
*  We'll be right back.
*  Mike, let's talk about that larger system that failed to expose these positive tests by Chinese swimmers
*  that kept these tests hidden. It sounds like one potential issue is that the system relies on
*  self-policing, on the idea that countries will punish their own athletes when they find evidence of doping,
*  which doesn't totally make sense to me, if I'm honest. There are these perverse incentives, right,
*  for many countries to not actually root out doping when they find it because, I mean, number one,
*  they want to win medals and number two, they don't want to damage the reputation of their athletes.
*  Why does the system work this way?
*  One of the reasons that it was set up this way is that it was just too logistically hard to have the
*  World Anti-Doping Agency, also known as WADA, trying to track thousands and thousands of Olympic athletes
*  around the world. They needed the countries to be able to administer the testing and to prosecute the cases
*  because it would have been too much. It would have been too cumbersome. But for there to be checks and balances
*  and for independence and rules and facts to be followed, WADA was supposed to make sure that those
*  countries were doing their job, that they were holding their athletes accountable, and they had the power
*  to step in, and in those cases in which they said, hey, this doesn't look right, more needs to be done,
*  they could come in and prosecute the cases. But what happens here is that when WADA finds out about this
*  and they get this explanation from the Chinese, they essentially take it at face value. They don't insert themselves
*  as they've done in other cases to try and discipline the athletes and keep them out of the water.
*  And because the system is so reliant on trust and on WADA doing their job to make sure that everyone's
*  following the rules, when WADA's credibility comes into question, the whole system comes into question.
*  And that's the point that Phelps and Schmidt were making when they were sitting before Congress under oath.
*  They were saying, can this thing, this thing that athletes have given themselves to, that they have allowed
*  into their lives to ensure that they and others are following the rules, is this thing legit or is it a charade?
*  Mike, it feels like a lot of this comes down to a pretty central question, which is why did WADA, this institution
*  that's supposed to be a backstop, just accept China's explanation for the doping, which, as you've said, seemed a little suspect?
*  WADA says that it accepted the Chinese argument basically because all of the athletes had similarly low levels of this drug in their system.
*  The science looked like it had come from ingestion.
*  All of the swimmers who tested positive were staying at the same hotel.
*  Swimmers who had not been staying at the hotel did not test positive.
*  And that it was just simply too hard to disprove what the Chinese were putting forward and that if they tried to prosecute the case themselves,
*  they wouldn't have been successful and they wouldn't have been able to stop them from competing at the Olympics.
*  But a lot of people don't buy it. They don't buy that that was enough to not do anything.
*  And look, we don't know the answer. We don't have full visibility into what went down here.
*  WADA has appointed a investigator to look into this, to see whether they gave China preferential treatment and whether this was handled properly.
*  That report is supposed to come out before the Olympics.
*  But in the void, as people have looked at this, they have speculated about why is it that this happened?
*  And one of the theories put forward, a sort of dark one, has been WADA didn't want to embarrass China,
*  especially at a time when China was moving heaven and earth to do the Olympic movement as solid by holding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.
*  Games that they were trying to pull off at the height of a pandemic in a country that was shut down.
*  And other theories have been that the Olympic movement doesn't really want to go out and tarnish their own sports
*  and put out there the notion that these games may not be being played on a level playing field.
*  But Mike, doesn't it tarnish the sport more to find evidence of doping and not report it?
*  I mean, doesn't it damage the reputation of swimming, of the Olympics to not come clean about this stuff?
*  Not if you're able to keep it secret, because if you're able to keep it secret, then you don't ever have to deal with the ramifications of it.
*  But if in the lead up to an Olympics, you had to suspend half of a country's swimming team so they couldn't compete,
*  that would cast a really dark cloud over the games.
*  And at the end of the day, there's an enormous amount of money on the line here.
*  And sports first instinct is not necessarily to tarnish its own product.
*  As much as these games are about, you know, athletics and competition, it's about making money.
*  And do you want to tarnish that product?
*  Do you want to undermine it in the eyes of fans and raise the question,
*  oh, gosh, is this really a level playing field or are there cheaters who are out there?
*  And if it remains secret, you don't have to deal with that.
*  And the only reason we know about this case is because of your reporting,
*  which makes me wonder whether you think there may be other examples of this that we haven't yet heard about.
*  Look, I don't know what I don't know.
*  But the problem is, is that when you learn about things like this, it calls everything else into question.
*  If this was happening here, why was it happening?
*  And what does it mean for everything else?
*  After all your reporting, Mike, I have to ask if you actually think that we can trust what we see in the Olympics next month,
*  that we're going to be watching the best athletes from all over the world who trained for years for this,
*  put their bodies to the test and achieve these miraculous feats based not on drugs, but on their merit.
*  I mean, when you watch the Olympics, will you trust that?
*  Well, we know that 11 of the Chinese swimmers who tested positive for TMZ will be going to this Olympics in Paris to compete.
*  They have faced no consequence and will be in the water swimming against American swimmers who have, you know, been subject to this rigorous drug testing program.
*  But I've wondered about this question, too.
*  Right. What should we think when we tune into the Olympics?
*  Should we look at it and sort of just kind of let it go and enjoy it for what it is?
*  Or should we look at it more skeptically?
*  I don't really know the answer.
*  So what I did was I went to the chief broadcaster of the Olympics, NBC, and I asked them essentially that same question.
*  I said, as the entity that is in charge of putting this thing out, that is in charge of the pipe in which everyone will get the Olympics,
*  are you confident that you'll be broadcasting an Olympics in which the athletes will be competing on a level playing field?
*  And NBC acknowledged receiving the email.
*  They said that they got it and they never got back to me.
*  And in all of this, it was a bit telling that the chief broadcaster of the Olympics couldn't answer the basic question about whether fans could trust what they're going to be seeing.
*  Mike, thank you so much.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Supreme Court handed the Biden administration a victory in a First Amendment case on Wednesday.
*  It was a case that involved government officials urging social media platforms to take down posts on topics like the coronavirus vaccine and election fraud,
*  which they believed were spreading misinformation.
*  Two Republican attorneys general and several others had sued, arguing that that communication violated the First Amendment.
*  But the court rejected their argument in a six to three decision with Justice Amy Coney Barrett writing the majority opinion,
*  where she said that the plaintiffs didn't have standing to sue because they hadn't suffered direct injury.
*  And the Supreme Court looks poised to temporarily allow abortions in Idaho when a woman's health is at risk.
*  That's according to Bloomberg News, which obtained a copy of an opinion that briefly appeared on the court's website.
*  If that document reflects the justice's final decision,
*  it would reinstate a ruling by a lower federal court that paused Idaho's near total ban on abortion
*  to allow hospitals in the state to perform the procedure in emergencies in order to protect the health of the mother.
