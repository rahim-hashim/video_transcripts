# A Conversation With the Architect of Trump's New Trade War
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  President Trump says he's going to announce so-called reciprocal tariffs on every country [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=8.58s)]
*  with duties placed on the U.S. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  With less than a month in office, President Trump has pursued more trade actions against [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=15.26s)]
*  adversaries and allies than all the trade measures he took in his entire first term. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=22.64s)]
*  The tariffs ordered by President Trump went into effect at the... [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=28.52s)]
*  Canada and Mexico will be among the hardest hit by these tariffs. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=31.24s)]
*  These tariffs more than triple what was done during the first term. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=34.84s)]
*  And there's one man guiding it all. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=39.16s)]
*  President-elect Trump choosing Peter Navarro for a top economic position in his next administration. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=41.16s)]
*  Today, my colleague Ana Swanson on how Peter Navarro rose to become one of Trump's key [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=46.0s)]
*  and why he thinks tariffs will usher in a new era of American prosperity. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=53.14s)]
*  It's Tuesday, February 18th. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=64.42s)]
*  Hi Ana. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=72.9s)]
*  Hey, how are you? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=73.9s)]
*  Good, thank you for being here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  I wanted to talk to you because you covered President Trump in his first term and you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=77.5s)]
*  focused a ton on international trade. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=81.94s)]
*  So I figured you would be the right person to talk to and help me understand this key [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=84.74s)]
*  advisor Peter Navarro, who's been advising Trump on all of these tariff policies that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=89.38s)]
*  we've been hearing about recently. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=94.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=95.53999999999999s)]
*  So I met Peter Navarro when I was covering trade policy in Trump's first term. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  And he's an interesting person because he had a very unusual journey to the White House. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=100.7s)]
*  And he had views about trade in China that were considered pretty unconventional and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=105.9s)]
*  popular. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=110.68s)]
*  But over time, these views have become one of the driving forces of Trump's trade policy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  So I'm pleased to see you after four long years of exile. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  So recently I went to see him again with two colleagues from The Daily. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  We met him at the Eisenhower Executive Office building, which is just west of the White [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=130.74s)]
*  House. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=134.96s)]
*  And we sat down with him in his office to understand how he came to have these ideas [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=139.36s)]
*  about trade and tariffs. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=144.04s)]
*  So you want us here? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=146.04s)]
*  And now that he's in the role that he's in, what his ideas could mean for the country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=150.04s)]
*  So Dr. Navarro, you are synonymous with Donald Trump and his agenda. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=155.28s)]
*  But not all that long ago, you were a Democrat. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=161.2s)]
*  So tell us that story. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=165.08s)]
*  Where does that story start? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=166.44s)]
*  The I went from being kind of a Democrat to being a Trump Republican. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=169.48s)]
*  And the reality is that there's not much difference between that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=179.32s)]
*  The traditional Democratic Party was a lot like MAGA in that it was the party of the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=185.4s)]
*  working class, American manufacturing, blue collar workers. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=192.48s)]
*  The goal of that party, at least what it said it was, was to increase the real wages and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  prosperity of blue collar workers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=203.92s)]
*  And I was very comfortable with that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  I grew up in a single family household with my mom. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  We had a hard life. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=214.76s)]
*  And I identify to this day with the working class. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  So when you started talking, what did you learn? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=221.0s)]
*  So he talked about being raised by a single mom, how he was a latchkey kid. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=223.08s)]
*  He also loved school and he did well. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=227.54s)]
*  And he goes on to Tufts University. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=230.2s)]
*  And after he graduated in the 1970s, he's thinking he wants to see what the world is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=233.04s)]
*  like and travel a little bit. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=237.76s)]
*  I became really intrigued by Thailand. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=239.68s)]
*  One day as I was thinking that maybe I should go there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=244.08s)]
*  And then one day kind of randomly, he's walking around the Berkeley campus and this guy asks [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=247.48s)]
*  him, hey, want to go to Thailand? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=251.88s)]
*  And I looked over and it was the Peace Corps table. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=255.16s)]
*  And that guy happened to be recruiting for the Peace Corps. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=259.64s)]
*  Of course, I had to say yes because of the synchronicity of the whole thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=262.4s)]
*  I don't want to get too Californian on you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=268.4s)]
*  But that was an interesting moment. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=271.08s)]
*  And so Navarro decides to go. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=273.0s)]
*  Peace Corps, I feel like that's a really unusual stop along your way to becoming tariff czar. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=275.16s)]
*  Yeah, he says he wanted to learn about different cultures and got to travel a lot around Asia. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the whole ability to see the world from outside the United States, it makes you [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=284.92s)]
*  very humble. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  And when I came back, it motivated me to go into policy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=295.12s)]
*  And when he came back, he ended up at Harvard studying government and economics in the 80s. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=303.12s)]
*  He finished his PhD. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  He moves out to Southern California and he starts teaching economics and public policy [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  at UC Irvine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=316.91999999999996s)]
*  And then he decides to run for mayor of San Diego. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=318.76s)]
*  My only goal as mayor was to address the problems of traffic ingestion, overcrowded schools, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  the awful sewage system. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=332.04s)]
*  I mean, it was a populist campaign just at the local level on a different set of issues. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=333.8s)]
*  I mean, I sometimes joke I was like, like mini Trump before Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=338.48s)]
*  He loses that election. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=343.24s)]
*  And over the next several years, a couple of huge economic policy shifts happen that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=345.6s)]
*  really shape his thinking. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=350.16s)]
*  First in 1994 comes NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=353.12s)]
*  And this is a really important moment for the US economy because this was the first [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=358.92s)]
*  time that the US was engaging in a free trade agreement with a developing country, Mexico. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=363.04s)]
*  And then in 2001, China enters the World Trade Organization, this other big moment in trade [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=369.32s)]
*  that really shifts the politics of trade in America. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=377.08s)]
*  So it sounds like you have these two big moments where America is really becoming much more [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=381.48s)]
*  globalized in its manufacturing processes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=386.48s)]
*  You've got NAFTA where it's signing agreements with places like Mexico and opening itself [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=388.84s)]
*  up to other countries. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=393.04s)]
*  And then you've got this moment when China joins the World Trade Organization, which [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=394.36s)]
*  really brings China onto the world main stage in a way that it hadn't been before. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=398.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's after these big policy shifts when Navarro starts to see something happening [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=405.12s)]
*  with his students that bothers him. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=410.24s)]
*  I was the macro economist teaching business students how to forecast the economy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=412.6s)]
*  And in about 2002 and 2003, I began to notice that the business students who were in the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=420.32000000000005s)]
*  fully employed program were losing their jobs. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  And it was like, what's going on here? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=433.56s)]
*  He's trying to figure out what's going on. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  And he lands on something that he calls the China price. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  And what's that? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=442.76s)]
*  So he's observing this strange ability for Chinese firms to offer prices that are so [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=443.76s)]
*  much lower than other competitors. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  50% lower prices. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=451.48s)]
*  And he's saying that is starting to put US manufacturers out of business. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=453.36s)]
*  So he does a study to try to understand just how they're getting their prices so low. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=458.52s)]
*  It wasn't simply low wages. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  So one way companies could get their prices low is by paying their workers lower wages. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=467.84s)]
*  But Navarro finds that China is doing a lot more than that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  Like currency manipulation, like counterfeiting and piracy, the use of pollution havens, things [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=476.76s)]
*  like that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  And he's so troubled by this that he ends up writing three books on China. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=484.64s)]
*  The first was called The Coming China Wars. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  It just got skewered in the financial times. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=491.12s)]
*  That book gets panned. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=495.12s)]
*  Do you remember anything from the skewering? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=496.32s)]
*  Oh, it's just radical, crazy guy, this kind of thing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=498.84s)]
*  And I thought, look, these people don't get it, except among all of the corporations and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=505.84s)]
*  unions and plain old folk that were getting just hammered by that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=513.88s)]
*  It's like, OK, let's keep going on this. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=518.88s)]
*  And I'm thinking, you know what, people read books, but not a lot of them anymore. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=522.0s)]
*  So let's do the movie. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=527.96s)]
*  And then he also creates a documentary, which is narrated by Martin Sheen. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=529.52s)]
*  And it was the same kind of reaction. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=534.04s)]
*  Hollywood and it's like, oh, you're exaggerating stuff. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=537.76s)]
*  Anna, how would you characterize Navarro's view of all of this? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=541.72s)]
*  Is his assessment of what China is doing fair? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=545.6s)]
*  It's right that a lot of people agree now that the Chinese government was not playing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=549.76s)]
*  by international trade rules. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=553.76s)]
*  But even if they were, I think the entry of basically a billion people into the global [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=556.56s)]
*  economy would have been a huge shock either way. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=562.68s)]
*  And it ends up being kind of complicated in terms of who benefited and who lost. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=566.6s)]
*  OK, so let's talk about that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=571.12s)]
*  Tell me what some of the benefits are first. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=573.96s)]
*  So the first benefit is that you do have a lot of Chinese people lifted out of poverty. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=576.92s)]
*  So hundreds of millions of Chinese people who are moving out of poverty into the middle [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=582.64s)]
*  class. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=588.0s)]
*  And then you have basically the American standard of living today created. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=589.36s)]
*  How many people do you know who love Costco, who love to buy inexpensive things off of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=594.5999999999999s)]
*  Amazon? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=600.3199999999999s)]
*  So a lot of that is made possible by this China price, by Chinese factories making cheap [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=601.32s)]
*  goods. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=607.24s)]
*  But there were definitely a lot of downsides as well. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=608.84s)]
*  So you have a lot of US factories going out of business because they can no longer compete [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=611.8000000000001s)]
*  with the cheap prices that Chinese firms are offering. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=616.7600000000001s)]
*  And you have millions of US manufacturing jobs that were destroyed in that process, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=620.72s)]
*  economists have found. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=626.44s)]
*  I don't think they anticipated just how hard the people on the losing end would be hit. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  There was this assumption that people who lost their jobs to trade could be helped to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  move to find other jobs or go through retraining programs that would give them even better [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=638.92s)]
*  jobs in this new economy. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=644.4s)]
*  And they didn't anticipate, I think, that this transition was a lot more disruptive [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=647.8399999999999s)]
*  and painful. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=652.92s)]
*  And the pain was really localized and vivid and sharp, particularly in the industrial [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=655.2s)]
*  Northeast and Midwest, where people now are really hurting because they don't have factory [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=663.44s)]
*  employment anymore. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=670.2800000000001s)]
*  And economists have found that then other problems follow like drug addiction. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=672.6800000000001s)]
*  And these are all things that Peter Navarro was focused on too, actually. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=678.32s)]
*  When I did my Death by China movie, I went to Dayton. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=681.96s)]
*  I saw the people who would otherwise be in factories walking around with shopping carts [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=688.0400000000001s)]
*  stealing copper out of homes and buildings, whatever they could, and then going and using [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=692.9200000000001s)]
*  the money to get high. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=699.12s)]
*  It really does sound like Peter Navarro is ringing the alarm bell on China kind of well [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=701.12s)]
*  before a lot of other people are. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=706.2s)]
*  How does he actually get attached to Donald Trump, though? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=708.76s)]
*  So Trump at this point has been complaining about China and its trade practices for a [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=712.16s)]
*  really long time. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=715.96s)]
*  President Trump, the way we intersected was through an interview, interestingly enough, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=718.4s)]
*  that he did for the Los Angeles Times in 2011. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=724.28s)]
*  At one point, Trump is asked by the LA Times, what are some of your favorite books on China? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=728.08s)]
*  And he proceeded to do something I'm not sure I could even do. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=734.12s)]
*  He listed his top 10 books by title and author. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=738.64s)]
*  And I was number six, the coming China Wars. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=743.76s)]
*  And he mentions one of Peter Navarro's books. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=746.92s)]
*  So they start corresponding and ultimately, then candidate Trump decides to bring Navarro [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=750.88s)]
*  on to his campaign. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=759.2399999999999s)]
*  What I try to do is see problems and solve them. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=761.0s)]
*  And the problem I saw crystal clear is the unfair trade that was driving up these large [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=765.52s)]
*  trade deficits and shutting down our factories and creating just all sorts of misery for [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=774.84s)]
*  blue collar workers. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=782.92s)]
*  Trump wins the presidency and Navarro is given a job in the administration working [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=785.56s)]
*  on trade policy, but he's still kind of an outsider. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=791.0s)]
*  There are a lot of other more influential advisors in the administration at that point [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  who are opposed to the idea of imposing broad tariffs on foreign products. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=800.52s)]
*  And so you come to a point where, you know, most of the other advisors are saying to President [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=806.64s)]
*  Trump, we can't do that. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=812.04s)]
*  We shouldn't impose tariffs. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=814.48s)]
*  It was always the same, like Mnuchin and Kohn and Kudlow and all these people, they just [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=816.0400000000001s)]
*  didn't buy in. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=823.08s)]
*  And the defining moment for me in terms of when I finally was able to begin doing what [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=825.24s)]
*  the president wanted me to do was about four months in. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=833.84s)]
*  And he made the famous, where's my Peter call? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=837.2800000000001s)]
*  It's like he's sitting around with these guys four months in. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=840.5200000000001s)]
*  Nothing's happening at all. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=843.24s)]
*  And he goes, where's my Peter? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=846.08s)]
*  I go over there and I have this like battle with Kohn and whatever. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=848.0s)]
*  And then some months later, I'm able with Wilbur Ross to get the steel and aluminum [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=852.44s)]
*  tariffs in and Kohn leaves like a crying little baby in a huff. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=859.8s)]
*  And Navarro prevails and he helps to draft tariffs on China and on steel and aluminum [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=864.4s)]
*  from countries around the world. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=872.68s)]
*  So when Trump and Navarro leave office in 2021, what exactly had they accomplished in [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=874.7199999999999s)]
*  terms of the trade relationship with China? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  So they had really changed the American terms of trade with the rest of the world. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=884.64s)]
*  They had imposed a lot of tariffs on things like metals and washing machines and over [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=888.68s)]
*  three hundred billion dollars of products coming in from China. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=895.8399999999999s)]
*  And they had also signed a trade deal with China and reworked the North American Free [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=899.52s)]
*  Trade Agreement into a new deal. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=904.84s)]
*  But then there's an interesting wrinkle to the story. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=908.8s)]
*  So Trump's orbit has changed a lot through the whole first term. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=911.28s)]
*  New advisers have come in. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=915.92s)]
*  They get fired. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=917.56s)]
*  People are in and out very quickly. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=919.36s)]
*  But Peter Navarro, even though he's sometimes sidelined, is there the whole time. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=922.28s)]
*  And when the January 6th hearing comes, Navarro is called to testify and he shows his loyalty [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=927.92s)]
*  to Trump by refusing to hand over his notes. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=935.3199999999999s)]
*  And then he is sent to prison for four months for failing to honor the subpoena. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=938.72s)]
*  So just to clarify, I went to prison not because I didn't want to cooperate with an [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=944.12s)]
*  investigation, but because it was my duty as a senior White House official to refuse [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=951.4s)]
*  to appear when issued an unlawful congressional subpoena. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=958.64s)]
*  That case is being litigated. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=963.0s)]
*  It was unfortunate. They put me in prison until they should have waited until my appeal [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  ran its course. But I want to be really clear about why I went to prison. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=971.44s)]
*  I was defending the Constitution. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=976.76s)]
*  Now, to your point. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=978.64s)]
*  And he gets out of prison on the day of the Republican National Convention and he flies [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=982.12s)]
*  directly from prison to the RNC to give a speech. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=986.72s)]
*  Yes, indeed. This morning I did walk out of a federal prison in Miami. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden and his Department of Injustice put me there. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1002.24s)]
*  Wow, that is quite an image. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1007.72s)]
*  And we know what happens next. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1009.4s)]
*  Trump, who is somebody who obviously prizes loyalty very much, wins the election, returns [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1010.6s)]
*  to office, and he brings Peter Navarro back with him. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1016.24s)]
*  That's right. And this time he is even more empowered to totally transform America's [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1019.64s)]
*  trade relationships. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1025.4s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1031.84s)]
*  So from the review of my book, there's been a steady evolution of thought amongst the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1037.4s)]
*  public, even on Wall Street, about what I've been saying, what the president has been [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1053.0s)]
*  saying, what others in our camp have been saying. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1058.8000000000002s)]
*  And I guess I'm mainstream now. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1062.6000000000001s)]
*  That's scary. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1067.4s)]
*  So, Anna, now that we understand how Peter Navarro formed his worldview about trade with [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1073.24s)]
*  China, let's talk about his tools for bringing back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1077.88s)]
*  And those tools are tariffs. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1083.32s)]
*  Tell us about how Navarro makes the case for tariffs. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1085.92s)]
*  So Peter Navarro believes that tariffs are a very important tool to balance out America's [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  trading relationships, that, as we talked about, countries like China have been cheating [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1097.4s)]
*  international rules by making products more cheaply than they should and stealing [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1104.44s)]
*  intellectual property. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1110.48s)]
*  And basically, they're putting out goods that American businesses just can't compete [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1112.4s)]
*  with. And so American businesses need kind of a shield from those products. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1116.92s)]
*  And that shield is tariffs. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1122.68s)]
*  How exactly is it a shield? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1125.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, a tariff is a charge on a good when it comes over the border. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1127.96s)]
*  So if companies are making their products outside the United States and they want to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1132.8400000000001s)]
*  sell them inside the United States, they pay that extra fee. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1137.0800000000002s)]
*  So the thinking is tariffs will incentivize companies to make their products inside the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1141.24s)]
*  United States so they don't have to pay that fee. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1146.36s)]
*  But what does Navarro say about the criticisms that are often cited of using tariffs? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1149.6399999999999s)]
*  Like Trump himself has acknowledged on social media that tariffs could lead to higher [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  prices, for example, for consumers. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1160.1999999999998s)]
*  And in the U.S., just to point out, we just went through a period of super high inflation. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1162.7199999999998s)]
*  And that was really, really painful for people. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1167.4799999999998s)]
*  So I asked him about that and he was pretty clear about his position. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1170.56s)]
*  Tariffs do not cause inflation when they're imposed by the largest market in the world. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1174.48s)]
*  And that has been demonstrated by the fact that we aggressively impose tariffs during [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1180.9199999999998s)]
*  the first term. We had zero inflation as a result. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1187.52s)]
*  He said that tariffs will not hurt consumers. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1190.8799999999999s)]
*  So I did want to push back on some of the economics of tariffs and also get your [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1194.1599999999999s)]
*  response. So, you know, first, there were quite a few studies that showed that American [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1199.2s)]
*  consumers did bear the brunt of the China tariffs that much of that cost was passed [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1204.44s)]
*  through. But then secondly, even more basically, I mean, stay with that. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1209.56s)]
*  Let's do this. So who are the studies by? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1214.88s)]
*  You know, a lot of very prominent economists, New York Fed, but other academic economists [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1218.0s)]
*  as well. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1224.64s)]
*  All the ones that were wrong about Trump, you know, like the biggest ones that you don't [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1226.0400000000002s)]
*  believe in and that you kind of felt. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1231.88s)]
*  But I think it's fair, Anna, for you to go back and look at those analyses who said it [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1233.4s)]
*  and then look what they said, for example, when Trump came into office and how they [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1239.1200000000001s)]
*  predicted there would be chaos, recession, inflation, stagnation that has never happened. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1243.8400000000001s)]
*  I think my point here is that the academic community can't be trusted to critique Trump [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1249.6399999999999s)]
*  economics. And they have a credibility problem because they've been crying this wolf. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1257.12s)]
*  They did it all through the first term. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1262.7199999999998s)]
*  None of that happened. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1264.52s)]
*  They're just wrong. We're right. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1266.7199999999998s)]
*  They're wrong. End of story. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1268.28s)]
*  And you feel that the American people are on your side with that assessment that economists [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  don't know what they're talking about. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1275.3999999999999s)]
*  It's the American people who've borne the brunt of this for going on, what, 40 years [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1277.24s)]
*  now. How many times do you have to be told by politicians and corporate flaks that this [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1284.8000000000002s)]
*  free trade stuff is good for you and then you lose your job and your community falls [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1293.44s)]
*  down around you for you to stop believing them? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1299.48s)]
*  I mean, that's why Trump got elected in 2016. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1303.16s)]
*  Setting economists and think tanks aside, I mean, even sort of common sense, right? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1307.08s)]
*  So tariffs work by raising the price of foreign goods. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1311.32s)]
*  And when the price of foreign goods go up, you know, that is what encourages people to [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1316.0s)]
*  buy domestic goods. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1320.52s)]
*  I mean, isn't that the way that tariffs work? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1321.8s)]
*  Let's walk through that. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1323.4s)]
*  OK, there's a rhyme to the reason why we did. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1325.52s)]
*  I asked him this question a couple of times. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1328.6000000000001s)]
*  Aren't tariffs supposed to increase prices? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1330.52s)]
*  Because that's how tariffs work. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1333.2s)]
*  They make the foreign good more expensive. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1335.0s)]
*  So people buy American goods instead. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  But Navarro didn't really give me a direct answer. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1341.24s)]
*  Here's the thing. We are we are the biggest market in the world, which gives us buying [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1345.04s)]
*  power. OK, so particularly export dependent economies that China's of this world are [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1353.32s)]
*  who heavily rely on Americans buying their products. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1361.44s)]
*  If that becomes more difficult to do. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1368.8s)]
*  What's the first thing these countries are going to do in response to tariffs? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1374.8s)]
*  What are they going to do? We slap a tariff on where they what are the producers over [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1379.48s)]
*  there going to do? What are you going to do? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1382.96s)]
*  Tell me what do you what they do. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1384.84s)]
*  You're a producer over there and suddenly suddenly tariffs are up and you got to [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1387.24s)]
*  compete with an American producer. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1392.48s)]
*  What are you going to do? So your assumption is that they would lower their prices? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1394.8s)]
*  That's exactly what they do. It's not an assumption. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1397.68s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1400.1200000000001s)]
*  Instead, he talked about how Chinese companies would absorb some of the cost of the [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1402.2s)]
*  tariffs to keep prices low. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1407.2s)]
*  Your goal is to help US factories. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1408.88s)]
*  But a lot of US factories do buy components and parts from abroad. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1412.0s)]
*  And, you know, I've talked to a lot of manufacturers who say that would raise their [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1417.88s)]
*  costs. It would make them harder, you know, harder for them to make things. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1422.0s)]
*  Does that kind of backfire on your agenda? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1426.76s)]
*  So here's one of the iron laws of manufacturing. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1429.0800000000002s)]
*  If manufacturing goes abroad, the supply chains follow and vice versa. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1434.0800000000002s)]
*  OK, so I also asked him about US manufacturers who are buying parts from [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1441.2s)]
*  abroad and whether tariffs would hurt their business. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1447.68s)]
*  And he didn't seem all that concerned with what I've been hearing from some American [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1451.2800000000002s)]
*  manufacturers. He just kept coming back to the idea that ultimately tariffs will [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1454.96s)]
*  incentivize both American and foreign companies to build factories in the US. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1461.2s)]
*  You can have a domestic investment come quickly when we did this. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1466.5200000000002s)]
*  Which he believes will then lead to higher wages for Americans. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1469.56s)]
*  You see wages go up and that gives consumers more spending power and offsets any [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1474.08s)]
*  rising prices. If real wages rise faster than any other types of inflation, people [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1480.72s)]
*  are still better off. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1486.84s)]
*  And he said these tariffs aren't happening in a vacuum. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1488.48s)]
*  When I was a campaign adviser in 2016, I had a mantra. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1492.3999999999999s)]
*  It was tax cuts, deregulation, strategic energy dominance, fair trade. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1498.56s)]
*  Those were the four components, the tires on the car towards economic prosperity. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1507.12s)]
*  He argues that if the Trump administration is able to get the price of oil down, if [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1513.56s)]
*  Elon Musk and his team are able to cut government waste and red tape, and if Trump [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1519.4s)]
*  keeps taxes low, all of these moves together would reduce inflation and help [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1524.84s)]
*  the US economy. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1530.3999999999999s)]
*  One of the most important things that we're trying to accomplish, that President [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1532.0s)]
*  Trump is trying to accomplish, is more stable and resilient supply chains, which [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1536.84s)]
*  we have learned to be an enormous problem in the wake of the pandemic. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1542.08s)]
*  So that's a major national security and economic security risk. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1546.8s)]
*  But what Navarro said is the most important part of all of this, why he's so [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1551.04s)]
*  focused on tariffs and bringing manufacturing back to the United States, is [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1555.3999999999999s)]
*  that it all comes back to national security. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1559.6s)]
*  We get screwed by everyone and we could afford it in the 1950s. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1562.6s)]
*  We can't afford it. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1570.44s)]
*  And that's the thing the rest of the world needs to understand. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1572.04s)]
*  It's like when they want to come to Uncle Sam for support for democracy, if we [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1574.56s)]
*  don't have manufacturing in the defense industrial base, because it all got [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1584.0s)]
*  exported because people are cheating us on trade, we're not going to be there. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1588.0s)]
*  And that's why in the first term, when President Trump said economic security is [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1595.24s)]
*  national security, it was a very important message and foundation for the way we [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1600.04s)]
*  here in Trump land think about things. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1608.28s)]
*  The sense I'm getting from talking to you about your conversation with Navarro is [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1611.8s)]
*  that we're talking about these really aggressive, audacious policy tools. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1616.44s)]
*  And in fact, you know, in some form or fashion, the U.S. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1621.12s)]
*  has been using them for the past few years. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1623.92s)]
*  They obviously started in the first Trump administration. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1626.4s)]
*  But what's coming through is that it doesn't sound like Navarro is actually [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1629.1999999999998s)]
*  grappling with what you're describing as the potential negative consequences [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1632.8s)]
*  of these tariffs. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1637.6s)]
*  I don't think that he believes in those negative consequences. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1640.1999999999998s)]
*  No, he doesn't believe in what most experts are saying, which is that all of [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1644.84s)]
*  these tariffs could end up really hurting Americans. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1650.36s)]
*  It's not going to be painful for America. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1654.12s)]
*  It's going to be a beautiful thing. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1655.6s)]
*  President Donald Trump has proven that tariffs work for the American people, and [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1657.32s)]
*  they're going to be even more, much more important this second term. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1662.4s)]
*  This is all set in motion now, Ana. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1666.16s)]
*  So stay tuned. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1669.16s)]
*  You know, he and the president are embarking on imposing tariffs at just a [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B06iAQatI6U&t=1677.84s)]
