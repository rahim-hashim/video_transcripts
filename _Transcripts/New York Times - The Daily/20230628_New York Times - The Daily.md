# Suspicion, Cheating and Bans: A.I. Hits Americaâ€™s Schools
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65K1S6S-v0)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Since its introduction less than a year ago, ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence platform
*  that can write essays, solve math problems, and write computer code, has sparked an anguished
*  debate inside the world of education.
*  The question has become, is ChatGPT a useful research tool or an irresistible license to
*  cheat?
*  Today, my colleague Stella Tan speaks with teachers and students as they finish their
*  first semester with ChatGPT about how they're using it, how it's changing the classroom,
*  and the thicket of ethical questions that artificial intelligence raises at school.
*  It's Wednesday, June 28th.
*  Let's start by having you introduce yourself for me.
*  So I'm Alyana Narani.
*  I'm 19 years old and I'm studying at UCLA.
*  My name is Aiden.
*  Right now I'm in grade 12 in high school.
*  My name is Terry Dickerson.
*  I go to Montclair State University and I'm a junior.
*  I am 22, just graduated from college in Maryland.
*  And do you remember the first moment you heard about ChatGPT?
*  I actually first came across it through TikTok.
*  I think it was TikTok or Instagram.
*  I started seeing TikToks about it.
*  I started seeing YouTube videos about it and I was like, what is this thing?
*  And then I get back to school and every single syllabus I have says on it, if you use ChatGPT,
*  you will immediately fail.
*  And it's like, whoa, what is this?
*  Then I started exploring on it.
*  I was like, oh, I know, I have to use it.
*  And I was like asking it questions like, do you feel anything?
*  Do you ever get lonely?
*  I was taking an Aristotle class and I'm like so confused in it.
*  And so I typed in Aristotle metaphysics and then it told me all about Aristotle metaphysics.
*  I was like, oh my gosh.
*  I turned to my friend and I was like, this is real, right?
*  This isn't a prank.
*  It felt so otherworldly.
*  I was watching a movie that was based in the 3000s.
*  The way it types it out for you and you can watch it think, it's mesmerizing.
*  It's zeros and ones speaking back to me.
*  And I think I've used it for most major assignments since.
*  All right.
*  My name is Andrew Reeves and I'm 46.
*  I'm a history professor at Middle Georgia State University.
*  My specialization is medieval history.
*  But being a small department in a smaller school, I also teach ancient history.
*  I teach early modern history and world civilization survey courses.
*  And what made you want to become a professor?
*  Oh, so one is that I find this stuff fascinating.
*  Two, because I find it so fascinating, I want to share it with other people.
*  That is the biggie.
*  And three, there is the sense that for a functioning liberal democratic republic, it does help
*  to have the college educated people have a basic knowledge of history.
*  So there's the sense of duty about it.
*  But then there's also just the sheer joy in this because I like this stuff.
*  I want other people to like it.
*  I want other people to see that this is just as fascinating as I find it.
*  So I excitedly started a new semester, just, you know, hunker and done, ready to go.
*  And I was sitting in my office and first discussion board post I graded for World History I, I
*  read the post and I looked at it.
*  And I immediately thought, this does not read like a student.
*  And then I remembered thinking, I bet it's chat GBT.
*  And it's hard to put my finger on what it was exactly.
*  But it's a combination of polish together with impersonal.
*  Kind of like if Wikipedia had a voice.
*  But I felt, okay, we've got chat GBT detectors.
*  So I ran through chat GBT detector and bang, it said 99% chance of being fake.
*  And so I just emailed and said, all right, here, you've been given a zero because you
*  had an AI write this.
*  So the first time I was not super flustered, I thought, okay, this is just another instance
*  of dishonesty.
*  We can deal with it.
*  But what was more upsetting to me was in an upper level class.
*  I was, I want to say about three weeks later, and I was teaching Atlantic World.
*  What's Atlantic World?
*  It covers the early modern Atlantic, about 1400 to the mid 1700s.
*  And I raised some questions about the Stuart monarchy continuing the policies of Cromwell's
*  protectorate.
*  I read a post and it was a post that talked in too much detail about Stuart policies for
*  what I had covered in the readings and lectures I had assigned for that week.
*  It was with a voice.
*  That's the thing.
*  It was with the voice of someone who was fully familiar with foreign relations in 17th century
*  England.
*  And it was that too familiar voice, because the thing about even a bright undergrad, eight
*  and a half times out of ten, even when they know the material already because they've
*  been enthusiastic about this, their voice doesn't read like distilled Wikipedia.
*  There's still their own sort of personality.
*  There's still their own sort of idiosyncratic understanding.
*  There's still something they may have missed, or there's something supremely insightful
*  because they haven't been swimming in the material the whole time and they can come
*  at it from an outside angle.
*  But this post had none of that.
*  And I saw that.
*  That was when I got the sinking feeling.
*  What did it feel like?
*  It felt like all of my certainties about what teaching was going to be like were crumbling.
*  Because that was when I realized that now I can't go to any student posts and know if
*  I'm reading what a student wrote, even in upper level classes, even among history majors,
*  I'm going to be fighting this.
*  And that just, it was an effing gut punch.
*  I was disappointed.
*  I was sad.
*  It kind of felt like a little bit of betrayal.
*  But it was like all at once, all at once, this feeling of what in the hell am I going
*  to do now?
*  I don't endorse it, but I understand why a student who is taking World History I in order
*  to get their social science elective, I can understand why that student would consider
*  discussion board posting to be a hoop to jump through.
*  But if you are majoring in history, you should be interested enough in this that you can
*  sit down and write 600 words about it over two weeks.
*  So every time now I see a student post that looks like they know the material well, my
*  first thought isn't aha, this is a good student who's read the material.
*  My first thought is did a robot write this?
*  Every discussion board post that I see, it's gone from a sense of delight and anticipation
*  when I click to say what has a student said to a sense of suspicion and irritation that
*  I am having to Turing test each and every post.
*  Right.
*  So there was this growing anger, unease, distress that from here on out, there was going to
*  be this hall of suspicion hanging over every student post.
*  I mean, did you ever doubt yourself?
*  Did you doubt the your suspicions and also the the GPT detectors, which have been shown
*  not to be entirely accurate?
*  Aha.
*  Yes.
*  There is a vast gray zone of areas where I don't know.
*  Is this a student who knows the material well and is grammatically capable?
*  Is this a robot?
*  And I am near certain that robot generated posts have gotten past me because I don't
*  normally go in guns blazing in terms of disciplinary action.
*  And I would rather there be false negatives than false positives.
*  And I don't like going into course discussions with an adversarial mindset.
*  I want it to be where people learn things.
*  Yeah, I'd love to talk more about that.
*  How does that affect your approach to teaching and your relationship to your students?
*  So clicking open the discussion board and realizing that I might be reading text generated
*  by a machine that has no inner life.
*  That's you know, I feel I feel like you remember the psychology experiment when they got the
*  little baby monkey was hugging the model of a monkey because it needed something to
*  have contact with.
*  But it was hugging this piece of machinery.
*  I think overly dramatic.
*  I might be being overly dramatic, but I feel like I feel like that.
*  It's like, am I a duck swimming up to a decoy excitedly trying to mate with a piece of floating
*  wood?
*  Emma, that's what I feel like.
*  I mean, the joy of talking to a student is what it's that there's this other human out
*  there that I'm connecting with.
*  And when they're talking to each other on the discussion boards, that they're connecting
*  to other humans.
*  And the idea of robots, and eventually maybe robots talking to robots and no humans there.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I sort of have this terrible feeling that, you know, the future is this road going into
*  darkness and I have no idea what's at the end of it.
*  After the break, stories from students.
*  So tell me a little bit about how you've used Chachi BT for school.
*  When I had first heard it a while ago, I was like, I'm not going to touch it.
*  I really pride myself who I am as a student and I'm very dedicated to my academics.
*  I was like, I'm not even going to go near this thing.
*  I'm just going to be authentic in the work that I submit.
*  See, I don't use it to like analyze things or write my answers for me because, you know,
*  I'm paying so much for this education.
*  It kind of feels like it would just undercut all the value of it to cheat like that because
*  I'm learning how to critical think.
*  So why would I want AI to do that for me?
*  But after using it with my friend, I was like, okay, there is a way for this resource to
*  be used aside from how students have been using it for plagiarism.
*  I did use it for an English assignment where I was analyzing Beowulf and I had no idea
*  what was going on in the story because it was impossible to understand.
*  So I typed in Beowulf after 40 whatever into that GPT and it pumped out just a quick summary.
*  I had this exam to study for.
*  I'm not very good at math and I was like, maybe this thing can explain to me how this
*  math is working right now.
*  So I gave it all of the stats and immediately it populated a step-by-step process of how
*  to do the division, what everything met.
*  And I was like, wow, this was so, so, so helpful.
*  How would you have handled that situation before ChachiBT?
*  To be so honest, I probably would have just had to muster up the courage to just ask a
*  classmate, but it kind of eliminated that awkward step.
*  I think I would have just had to ask a friend or try harder, which now that I'm thinking
*  about it, I probably should have just done that.
*  Do you feel like you lost out on anything by using ChachiBT in that way?
*  I think there is something missed when you don't just go up to your classmates and ask
*  for help.
*  In the moment, I just really needed the answer.
*  But I think the downsides of constantly going to ChachiBT would be that you miss that one-to-one
*  connection that you could be having with a classmate, that you could be having with a
*  professor and really connecting and bonding over the material that you're discussing.
*  Sometimes I worry that I'm not a good critical thinker and that I'm only getting the shallow
*  level of the things I read.
*  And the good thing about ChachiBT is it kind of tells you what you're missing, which I
*  guess is making me a worse reader because I'm not learning anything on my own.
*  It didn't give me an analysis.
*  So as long as it's not giving me ideas, see, it's hard to know what it's going to crank
*  out.
*  So it's hard to know whether it's going to give you ideas.
*  But I just, yeah, the line is getting a little blurry now.
*  Yeah, I think as I'm giving you examples, I'm realizing, oh my gosh, it really is just
*  for critical thinking.
*  And that's what I'm using it for.
*  And I have like this internal law that I will not find shortcuts in analysis, but I
*  totally am doing that.
*  I don't think there's a way to use it and not do that because it will think for you.
*  If you give it a question, it'll just think for you.
*  I'm 22 years old and I went to a university in California for computer science.
*  I'm a recent grad and I studied finance.
*  I am 24 years old.
*  I just completed my master's in health sciences.
*  And you want to be anonymous?
*  Yes, please.
*  Have you ever directly copied and pasted from Chatt GPT and turned it in for an assignment?
*  Yeah.
*  It was like towards the end of the semester, I had a good amount of papers and final projects
*  coming up for like a multitude of classes.
*  I was like feeling very stressed about it.
*  And for me, especially, I despise writing papers like I'll do math problems and econ
*  problems like all day.
*  But researching and writing papers feels like the bane of my like academic existence.
*  I started using it to sort of create the structure of my papers.
*  I would just do like stream of consciousness on a doc and then it would package everything
*  that I said in it.
*  And then I would be able to like tweak it.
*  The first time I used it, I was writing like a discussion post or whatever.
*  So I just like copy paste the prompt and then it gave me a response.
*  Oh my God, it was so good.
*  It was so good.
*  Like it just wrote everything out clearly.
*  And like the section structure was so good too.
*  It wasn't the most detailed.
*  I was like, dang, I can work with this.
*  You know, I can like rearrange them to just add some little more specific details.
*  Out of paranoia, I used a lot of plagiarism platforms to see if it even detected AI.
*  And then my use of it became more and more complex as I began to trust it.
*  So I was going to write about like a criminal justice system.
*  And then as like the deadline encroached on me, I was like, yeah, I'm not really finishing
*  this.
*  So I started having like a conversation with chat GPT where I was like, okay, I want you
*  to write 500 words talking about this topic.
*  And it did it.
*  I read through it and I was like, okay, this is good work, but it doesn't really sound
*  like me.
*  So then I gave chat GPT, I was like, I'm going to give you something that I've already written
*  and I want you to rewrite this paragraph to make it sound like me.
*  Wow.
*  So I copy pasted the page of what I'd already written and then it rewrote that paragraph
*  and I was like, okay, this works.
*  And then I pasted those sections into my final paper.
*  I reword it a little bit, make it sound like less robotic.
*  And then I'm like beep beep boop boop, turn it in, submit.
*  10 out of 10, good job, nice work.
*  I'm like, oh, thank you.
*  It was 10 out of 10?
*  Yeah.
*  I got an A and my professor actually liked the chat GPT part of the paper more than mine.
*  She gave us back our edits and the first half of the paper that I've written is full of
*  like correct this here, correct this there.
*  And then literally around the part where I started using chat GPT, the corrections just
*  reduced drastically to like a sentence per page or something for like the next four pages.
*  And I was like, so chat GPT literally made better quality work than I did.
*  Every opportunity I had from them, I would use chat GPT, you know what I mean?
*  Like first case, hey, what's up chat GPT?
*  How do I do this?
*  Did you have any feelings about using chat GPT to do your work in this way?
*  Not really.
*  Like, do I feel guilty about using chat GPT?
*  No, in the moment I was like even more excited.
*  I was like, dude, that's too easy.
*  Like I can go outside, I can touch grass or something.
*  I felt a little like damn, like, is this what I came to school for?
*  To like not do the work.
*  I had a good excuse.
*  Like I felt like this class was not important to me.
*  It was a requirement, but it was an antiquated requirement.
*  It was a Brazilian studies class.
*  Like I got to take a history class to fulfill a requirement.
*  It's also something I'm really interested in.
*  Like it's cool to learn about Brazil, but at the end of the day, I'm just trying to pass the course.
*  Do you don't feel like you kind of cheated yourself out of learning by using chat GPT
*  in these ways?
*  I didn't really feel that bad about it, to be honest.
*  If GPA is everything, then students are only going to care about grades.
*  And GPA is pretty much everything.
*  Your internship applications, your job applications, like they literally have all these like GPA
*  requirements.
*  So I feel like it's that emphasis on grading and GPA that pushes students to use whatever
*  means that they can.
*  We pay hella money, right?
*  We're just trying to get a degree.
*  That's it.
*  Credentials.
*  Just like, I'm just, I'm stressed.
*  I really need to get this degree so I can get a job so I can like survive.
*  Oh man.
*  So when that's your mindset, then it's really hard to like, be like, oh, no, let's learn
*  everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, what would you say to students who might say it's not fair that you use chat GPT like
*  this?
*  I mean, I can understand feeling pissed off when you did all that work and you found out
*  that other people like got there easier, right?
*  And it just makes you feel like all your work was invalidated, right?
*  I understand your feelings of like unfairness because I also used to feel that way too,
*  but it's like the whole world is unfair already.
*  People are going to get jobs and get picked for positions just off of knowing someone
*  or some weird connection or whatever.
*  Like the system is already unfair.
*  So it's up to you to try and like get it how you get it.
*  I would say like, it's going to be the same case for like people who didn't learn how
*  to type when computers came out.
*  And I feel like over time it's going to be used in a variety of different industries.
*  So it's like, it's not cheating.
*  It's just like learning how to use a new tool.
*  My viewpoint on education has changed quite a bit over, you know, I've been in school
*  for 13 plus years and I realized that, you know, the workforce that we're entering after
*  being students, it's vast case and it's who could get the information there the fastest,
*  and in the most concise manner.
*  And if you could identify tools that could help you do that while still having somewhat
*  of a foundational understanding of what it's doing, I see it as more of an extension of
*  our abilities as opposed to like cheating.
*  We live in an age now where like literally any piece of information I want, I could have
*  it immediately.
*  So it's just like, what is the incentive to really, really learn to like memorize if
*  you have like this external brain that could do it for you?
*  So, Andrew, earlier you mentioned a feeling of betrayal when you found out that your students
*  were using ChachiPT.
*  Yes.
*  And I'm wondering what the betrayal is of.
*  Is it of you, of the material, of the ideal of learning in a college setting?
*  I mean, who or what is being betrayed here?
*  I think it's a betrayal of the purpose of a university class.
*  Where on this journey together is my feeling about a class.
*  And so I suspect one reason it hit so hard for me is that a great many students never
*  saw themselves on a voyage of discovery along with me.
*  themselves en route to a credential.
*  And to some extent, the upset is my realizing that not everyone is going to see this as
*  a magnificent voyage of discovery.
*  Well, have you talked to your students about ChachiPT?
*  I need to do that at some point.
*  I think that ChachiPT opens up a teachable moment for getting students to think about
*  why do you learn to do stuff that a machine can do?
*  Why do you learn to do the math when I can realistically just pull out my phone and get
*  my phone to do it?
*  Why do math students still learn one plus one is two, for example?
*  Why do we still learn these things?
*  And I think I hope this is not me just telling myself I am still relevant, but I think that
*  the writing process, especially or the thinking process, what's important for a student is
*  they're learning how to organize their own thoughts.
*  They're learning how to really express themselves and to think clearly.
*  And that's the value of having people write and it's the value of having people think
*  about stuff they read.
*  It's not just sucking up the facts and spitting them back out.
*  It's taking in, you've got to have the facts in your head to chew on, to think about, to
*  train yourself as a thinker.
*  I think that as I've had this conversation, it's helped me to think about how this could
*  be a very teachable moment, especially at the outset of the semester in a way to say,
*  here's why we're doing this, rather than, you know, I will come down on you with the
*  wrath of God if you decide to cheat with robots.
*  Andrew, thank you so much for this conversation.
*  Well, it was a privilege getting to think out loud about all this stuff.
*  Thank you very much for talking to me about this.
*  Take care.
*  You too.
*  Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected the legal theory that state legislatures have
*  almost unchecked power to create the rules for federal elections and draw partisan election
*  maps without oversight from state-level courts.
*  The case stemmed from a voting map drawn by North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature
*  that was later thrown out by the state's Supreme Court as overly partisan.
*  North Carolina Republicans seeking to restore that map asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene,
*  saying the state court had no say over the matter.
*  By a vote of 6-3, the Supreme Court's justices disagreed, saying that state courts do have
*  a role to play in such disputes.
*  Many legal experts celebrated the ruling, saying it would avoid introducing even more
*  partisanship into federal elections.
