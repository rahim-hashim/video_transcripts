# Trump Era 2.0: D.E.I Bans, Jan. 6 Pardons and Revoked Security Details
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Mulbarrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=0.0s)]
*  It's Friday, January 24th, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=3.36s)]
*  Friends, welcome back to the roundtable. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=8.48s)]
*  Maggie, Zolan, David, thank you for being here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=12.56s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=15.44s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=16.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=17.44s)]
*  Last time the three of you were on the show, your locations were incredibly exotic. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=18.44s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago, Italy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=22.96s)]
*  Where were you, Maggie? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=25.88s)]
*  Washington, D.C. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=26.88s)]
*  Washington, D.C. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=27.88s)]
*  Today we join you from two boring studios on the East Coast. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=29.64s)]
*  We are taping this on Thursday afternoon at the end of week one of the Trump presidency, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=33.4s)]
*  and what a week it has been. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=37.78s)]
*  I don't think it's a stretch to say that in record time, President Trump has begun to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=39.6s)]
*  remake both the federal government and arguably American society in his image in just a few [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=43.82s)]
*  days. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  I want to start with late breaking policy that we haven't covered on the show from the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  White House, and that is around DEI, diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=55.76s)]
*  What exactly, Zolan, had been the policy around DEI, and what has Trump just changed it to? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=61.72s)]
*  So basically throughout the federal government, all the different cabinet agencies, you had [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=66.96s)]
*  these different programs that were focused on increasing diversity. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=71.92s)]
*  In the previous administration's mind, it was programs that would basically be addressing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=77.2s)]
*  decades of systemic inequalities and racism. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  And it's worth also saying this DEI has ramped up recently, but it's not necessarily new. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  It came out of legislation in the 60s, what have you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=91.84s)]
*  Trump comes into office and one of his executive orders essentially calls this immoral in saying [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  that under the guise of diversity that actually this is promoting inequality. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Just in recent days, his administration has taken a number of actions, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=107.92s)]
*  So that includes a directive to put those that are working and leading DEI initiatives [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=113.0s)]
*  on paid leave. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=118.28s)]
*  It also includes sending out memos to each agency, basically asking different federal [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=120.32s)]
*  employees to report any indication or any work that may be in progress that is in line [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=129.32s)]
*  with DEI initiatives. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=135.62s)]
*  And I've talked to federal employees who have said that this makes them feel as if [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=136.76s)]
*  they have to almost turn in their own peers who might be working on this broad term as [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=141.12s)]
*  well. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  And that's sent a chilling effect in the private sector as well, where now you have companies [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  that are basically trying to decide, do we still maintain these programs that were meant [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  to promote diversity? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=158.32s)]
*  Do we shy away from it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=159.84s)]
*  Do we rename it? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=160.92s)]
*  Is it just that the acronym is toxic in itself? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  We've seen multiple actions at this point to follow through on what during the campaign [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  was fiery rhetoric, but now seems to be an attempt to be at least one piece of reshaping [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=173.2s)]
*  this administration in a way that's aligned with the president. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=179.2s)]
*  I want to make sure I understand how widespread DEI programs and personnel have been in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  government to understand the impact of these executive orders. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  The executive orders and actions that attempt to root it out, essentially to forbid it, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=195.18s)]
*  and the ones, Zola, you mentioned, that attempt to encourage employees to report on essentially [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=201.06s)]
*  what's now banned attempts at enforcing DEI. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=208.5s)]
*  Who among you has a sense of just how much government we're talking about here, Maggie? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=213.5s)]
*  My sense is that it is actually not that gigantic a portion of the federal government, but it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  does exist in various pockets of agencies. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=224.18s)]
*  It shouldn't be surprising, Trump did say all of this, as Zola said, during the campaign, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  he is doing what he said he was going to do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=232.06s)]
*  But what is striking is this climate of fear that has been created within the federal government [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=235.02s)]
*  to say not just are we getting rid of these programs, but we are looking for who might [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=240.22s)]
*  be trying to work against Donald Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=245.46s)]
*  And you should be afraid. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=247.66s)]
*  Zola made the point to me just yesterday that if you worked in the federal government, there [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=250.12s)]
*  were two things in the past that you were asked to call in and snitch about. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=254.72s)]
*  One of which is if you had a suspected spy who might be leaking classified information [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=260.8s)]
*  to the Russians or the Chinese or the Iranians. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=266.24s)]
*  And the second was corruption. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=269.88s)]
*  And now we've created a third category, which is you might secretly be working on a DEI [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=272.48s)]
*  It's worth remembering too that the previous administration signed executive orders to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=279.64s)]
*  put racial equity essentially at the center of almost all their policy making, including [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=284.8s)]
*  the hiring practices of the administration and just how the structure of each agency [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  too. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=299.0s)]
*  So even if your job doesn't say DEI, even if it doesn't say it on your title, the fear [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=300.0s)]
*  here is palpable because people, even if you were working on say infrastructure investing [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=307.08s)]
*  or climate programs, there was still a focus on racial equity there the past four years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=313.08s)]
*  So you do have agency employees here almost wondering will they be next in a way. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=320.76s)]
*  And there's a place where you've seen it the most, Michael, which has been the Pentagon. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=326.6s)]
*  The first thing you saw was that they fired the Admiral who was the commandant of the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=332.56s)]
*  Coast Guard. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=337.2s)]
*  And the argument was that she was placing DEI principles above all others for defending [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=339.15999999999997s)]
*  the country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=347.96s)]
*  But you've heard it also in confirmation hearings, including for Pete Hegseth, who basically [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=349.12s)]
*  made the argument that he is going to focus on the war fighter first. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  This is at the core of his argument that women shouldn't be in combat. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  I want to be sure that we meet this argument from, whether it's Pete Hegseth or Donald [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=365.28s)]
*  Trump or Elon Musk, on its own terms. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=369.76s)]
*  And I listened to David, to Pete Hegseth talk about this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=373.64s)]
*  The way he put it was that he wanted to be sure that standards for everyone in the military [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=377.4s)]
*  were equal, not equitable. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  And this is a quote. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=386.76s)]
*  That's a very different word. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=387.76s)]
*  And in his inaugural speech, what President Trump said is he would forge a society, this [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=389.28s)]
*  is a quote that is colorblind and merit based. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  What I hear them saying is that diversity as something to be prized and sought in its [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  own right is out. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  What's in their saying is a merit based system in which diversity might be an outcome, but [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=406.88s)]
*  it's never the goal. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=413.88s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  And the idea that it's based has been something that we have heard repeatedly from Donald [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=419.36s)]
*  Trump, from other people in his new administration. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  And the idea is supposed to be that everybody starts out equal. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=424.8s)]
*  And as you say, if you end up in a place that happens to be diverse, that's just because [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  the people who rose were, in Donald Trump's telling, equipped for those roles. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=433.56s)]
*  However, what it does is ignore the notion that there is anything such as systemic racism [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=439.16s)]
*  or that people who are of color have historically not been necessarily looked at the same way [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=445.72s)]
*  or given an equal shake or had the same opportunities. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=453.12s)]
*  And it's not surprising to see that Donald Trump is enacting this plan, but it has been [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=456.88000000000005s)]
*  pretty sweeping. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  Clearly what stood out to many people about the way Trump approached this whole issue [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  was the element of, tell us about colleagues who are doing this thing when they shouldn't [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=470.48s)]
*  be to some and had kind of shades of McCarthyism. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  Rad out your colleagues. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=480.64s)]
*  And Maggie, you have spent a fair amount of time over the past few days reporting on a [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=482.16s)]
*  related subject, which is the ways in which the president and those around him are starting [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=487.36s)]
*  to somewhat systematically target people they don't want to be in this administration. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=492.72s)]
*  And even former Trump officials who they see as disloyal, who they want to begin to take [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=499.96s)]
*  perks away from. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=505.32s)]
*  So I would say a couple of things, Michael. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=506.96s)]
*  Number one, there have been all kinds of bottlenecks for hiring for various places across the Trump [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=509.08s)]
*  administration because the loyalty tests that are being applied to prospective candidates [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  are not just very intense and people are being asked a series of questions like who won the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  2020 election? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=524.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=525.84s)]
*  You know, how do you feel about January 6th, 2021? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=526.84s)]
*  But the perception of loyalty is completely dependent on how Donald Trump views it at [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=529.8s)]
*  any given moment. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=535.72s)]
*  So he has all kinds of people in his government who have said critical things about him in [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=536.76s)]
*  the past, including his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who ran against him in 2016, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=540.72s)]
*  made fun of his hand size. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=544.68s)]
*  But you have now, you know, people who can't be hired if they worked for Mike Pompeo, who [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=546.64s)]
*  Trump hired in his- [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=552.36s)]
*  To be the head of CIA. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=553.52s)]
*  And the secretary of state in his first administration. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  If you worked for Mike Pompeo, you can't come in. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=558.92s)]
*  If you worked for Mike Pence, you can't come in. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=561.0799999999999s)]
*  It goes on and on and on like this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=563.8399999999999s)]
*  You're saying these loyalty tests are very arbitrary. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  It's making it hard to hire. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=568.12s)]
*  And it's based on whoever is kind of up or down in Trump's mind at any given moment. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=569.64s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=572.76s)]
*  And whoever is whispering in Trump's ear about that other person at any given moment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=573.76s)]
*  Relatedly, he has stripped so far three that we know of former senior officials from his [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=577.56s)]
*  term of security protection that the Biden administration had granted them based on intelligence [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=585.84s)]
*  community assessments of ongoing threats from Iran. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  Which former officials, and I'm assuming this relates to the question of loyalty, what did [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=596.04s)]
*  they do to make Trump feel they were disloyal? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=600.92s)]
*  John Bolton, who was Trump's third national security advisor. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=605.08s)]
*  Bolton's sin in Trump's eyes was writing a very detailed insider account of his time [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=608.84s)]
*  as national security advisor, did not paint Trump in a good light. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=614.56s)]
*  He's been very critical of Trump since leaving. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=617.48s)]
*  They have had a very, very extensive falling out. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=619.4s)]
*  That one was not surprising, but it still put John Bolton at risk. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=622.0s)]
*  It's less easy to explain why he has such antipathy for Mike Pompeo, his second secretary [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=625.72s)]
*  of state and another aide to Mike Pompeo from the State Department, Brian Hook. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  All these people have lost their security. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=636.48s)]
*  Correct. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=638.1999999999999s)]
*  They have. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  They had a different type of security than Bolton did. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  was provided by the State Department. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=642.4000000000001s)]
*  But nonetheless, they also faced real threats. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=643.96s)]
*  And again, they are facing these threats because of actions they took in the service of Donald [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=652.5200000000001s)]
*  And now Donald Trump is saying, you're on your own. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=653.5200000000001s)]
*  You were just talking, Maggie, about also just how much loyalty is important to this [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=656.2s)]
*  president when it comes to the people that he brings in, when it comes to the actions [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=660.4000000000001s)]
*  that he's doing. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=665.0s)]
*  It is just interesting to square the argument of our previous topic of, you know, going [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=666.12s)]
*  after these DEI programs to have a government that's more based off merit when at the same [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=671.28s)]
*  time this president also we know is doing loyalty tests for people. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=676.84s)]
*  That's not exactly merit. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=682.04s)]
*  That's not merit as a top priority. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  That's loyalty as a top priority. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=685.36s)]
*  Here's the oddity that I find here. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=687.92s)]
*  I can understand this for political appointees. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  Everybody wants political appointees who are aligned with your vision of how to conduct [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=694.6s)]
*  the government. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=699.76s)]
*  But the loyalty tests are also being applied to younger career officials. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=700.96s)]
*  So what we saw happen at the National Security Council on where a bunch of folks were let [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=707.72s)]
*  go. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=712.48s)]
*  Well, they weren't let go yet, Michael. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=713.48s)]
*  It was interesting. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=715.4000000000001s)]
*  They were gathered on a two or three minute Zoom call. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=717.26s)]
*  It was well over 100 career people who work at the National Security Council but actually [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=722.24s)]
*  are detailed from the State Department, the Pentagon, the CIA. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=728.62s)]
*  And they were told, go home. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=733.7s)]
*  Don't call us. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=736.38s)]
*  We'll call you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=737.38s)]
*  Don't go on your email. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=738.5400000000001s)]
*  Don't do any work. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=740.22s)]
*  And we're going to tell you whether you still have your job. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=742.5400000000001s)]
*  And they all have the sense that their social media is being examined, that they're being [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=746.6600000000001s)]
*  that people are being interviewed to hear. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=753.0600000000001s)]
*  Have you ever heard them say something critical of Donald Trump? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=755.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=758.42s)]
*  I mean, taken together, the moves on DEI, especially the encouragement to turn in colleagues [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=759.42s)]
*  who are still doing DEI work now that it's forbidden, the firings. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=763.78s)]
*  I was about to ask you what it all adds up to, but I think that would be an abdication [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=767.54s)]
*  of my role as synthesizer. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=770.62s)]
*  I think what it clearly adds up to is dissent will not be remotely tolerated in this second [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=771.7399999999999s)]
*  Trump term. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=779.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's correct. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=780.04s)]
*  Trump believes, and he has in some cases reason to believe, that people working within his [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=781.68s)]
*  government, career bureaucrats in his first term, were working against his agenda. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=788.5999999999999s)]
*  Not just flagging concern, but in other cases, actively trying to stop him from implementing [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=794.64s)]
*  certain policies that he had campaigned on and wanted. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=801.16s)]
*  And he is the president. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=803.8s)]
*  He is able to do that. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=804.8s)]
*  That's different than this, which is we don't want any hint of independence or independent [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=806.88s)]
*  thinking or you're at suspicion because you may have said X, Y, Z. This is just something [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=812.56s)]
*  totally different. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=818.52s)]
*  And we talked about McCarthy earlier. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=819.52s)]
*  McCarthy's protege was Roy Cohn, and Roy Cohn, the fixer and lawyer, was Donald Trump's mentor. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=823.12s)]
*  And you're saying that it's sort of in Trump's DNA to ferret out those who would in any way [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=829.56s)]
*  get in his way, kind of stem to root, root to stem. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=835.84s)]
*  Not just ferret them out, but make them afraid of what might happen to them if they don't [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=839.08s)]
*  go along with what he wants. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=844.52s)]
*  I want to turn now to presidential pardons. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=846.52s)]
*  In the days since President Trump issued these blanket pardons and commutations, we've gotten [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=849.6s)]
*  a sense of just how blanket they actually are because three of the people who were given [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=854.52s)]
*  the longest prison sentences for their role in the assault on the Capitol have come out [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=859.68s)]
*  of prison. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=864.82s)]
*  Enrique Tarrio, ex-leader of the Proud Boys, who had been sentenced to 22 years for seditious [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=865.82s)]
*  conspiracy. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=871.4200000000001s)]
*  Stuart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers sentenced to 18 years for the same charge. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=872.4200000000001s)]
*  Joe Bigg sentenced to 17 years for that charge of seditious conspiracy, which pretty much [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=876.0600000000001s)]
*  the most serious crime you can be accused of committing against your own government. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=881.34s)]
*  Maggie, do you think Trump knew who was going to be released when he issued these blanket [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=886.34s)]
*  commutations and pardons, given what we're now learning? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=894.82s)]
*  I think Trump was well aware of what he was doing. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=897.5400000000001s)]
*  I know, based on reporting that we have all done, that there was extensive conversation [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=899.94s)]
*  within his world about what the options were for releasing various people. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=904.62s)]
*  There were at least two executive orders drafted as to what types of pardons there would be. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=909.0600000000001s)]
*  There was a discussion about, do you exclude the people who were convicted of seditious [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=914.48s)]
*  conspiracy, for instance. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=918.44s)]
*  Trump's team is well aware that there were people who were convicted or caught on video [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=920.4s)]
*  beating up police officers. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=927.04s)]
*  Trump himself had said during the campaign, as a way of avoiding getting pinned down on [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=929.5600000000001s)]
*  this, that he was going to go on a case-by-case basis. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=933.5600000000001s)]
*  And I don't think he was ever going to go on a case-by-case basis. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=937.0s)]
*  I think that he went in the direction that he always wanted to go in. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=940.16s)]
*  Would he recite chapter and verse what everybody was convicted of? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=944.04s)]
*  No. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=947.3199999999999s)]
*  But I think he has pretty clear understanding of the depth of the criminality described. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=948.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a pretty extraordinary, David, reimagining of the rule of law. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=956.24s)]
*  Is that perhaps too delicate a phrasing? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=963.4s)]
*  Well, I think there are three things going on. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=966.16s)]
*  I don't think it's too delicate a phrasing at all. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=968.4s)]
*  First of all, this is part of the completion of his rewriting of the history of January [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=971.56s)]
*  6th. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=976.52s)]
*  If his argument was it was a day of love, then there was really nothing to convict them [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=977.5799999999999s)]
*  for. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=983.1199999999999s)]
*  And he never actually, in talking about it, did the balancing test between these acts [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=984.1199999999999s)]
*  of sedition that the most serious of the cases were charged with or the attacks on the police. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=990.3599999999999s)]
*  He simply said, well, they've served a lot of time in jail. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=996.76s)]
*  They've served a fraction of their sentences. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1000.5200000000001s)]
*  So that's the first. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1004.36s)]
*  The second is the symbolism of doing this in the opening days of a new presidency. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1005.36s)]
*  Usually presidents wait till the end of the year, Christmas, or the end of their term. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1012.5200000000001s)]
*  This was highly unusual to have these pardons happen at the beginning. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1017.76s)]
*  And to those who are most suspicious of President Trump's motives, they think that he wants [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1021.72s)]
*  an outside group, militia, defenders, whatever you would call them, who are now free to go [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1028.9199999999998s)]
*  defend his interests out there and who now know that they can be pardoned. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1036.48s)]
*  I just want to make explicit what I think you're saying. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  There are now freed loyalists of Trump who owe their freedom to him, you're suggesting, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1044.1999999999998s)]
*  who may now operate distinctly in his defense in whatever way they think necessary. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1049.9599999999998s)]
*  One may feel particularly loyal to him because he let them out of jail in the opening days [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1056.96s)]
*  of his administration and believe whether they are right or wrong, that that gives them [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1063.24s)]
*  freedom to go defend him in any way that they see necessary. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1070.8400000000001s)]
*  And the president's going to be asked about this topic. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1076.04s)]
*  He already has been asked about it. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1079.52s)]
*  In the White House while he was signing an executive order, he was pressed and asked, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1081.62s)]
*  now that you've done these pardons, do you think there's essentially a place for proud [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1087.26s)]
*  boys for these groups, quote, in the political conversation? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1092.1799999999998s)]
*  And the president responded by saying, well, we'll have to see and then criticize their [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1096.7399999999998s)]
*  sentencing as well. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1100.9399999999998s)]
*  So it will have to watch too now that this has happened. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1102.6s)]
*  Will the president of the United States also continue to amplify these groups as well? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1106.7s)]
*  Can I just make one point, though? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1112.68s)]
*  Please, Maggie. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1114.14s)]
*  Trump is almost every single time that he has been warned that something he was going [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1115.14s)]
*  to do was going to have adverse consequences for himself. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1119.1200000000001s)]
*  He is betting that he can wait it out and the bad publicity will go away. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1122.6200000000001s)]
*  And I have to say that so far, based on the pretty muted reaction that I'm seeing, including [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1127.26s)]
*  from Republican lawmakers who had not just predicted that he wasn't going to do this, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1132.9399999999998s)]
*  but in many cases had to run for their safety on January 6th, have said almost nothing. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1137.1399999999999s)]
*  And so he tends to bet that public opinion will shift or change or at least not revolt [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1142.84s)]
*  against him. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1150.1599999999999s)]
*  And that's proven true over the last four years. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1151.1599999999999s)]
*  And when, Maggie, those Republican lawmakers have said something about these pardons, they've [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1153.4599999999998s)]
*  used a phrase over and over again. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1157.4199999999998s)]
*  It felt like they had all gotten together in the room and decided on the phrase. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1159.4199999999998s)]
*  The phrase was, we want to look forward, not backward. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1162.66s)]
*  And yet, Zolan, in one important respect, congressional Republicans do want to look [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1166.9s)]
*  backward. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1174.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1175.14s)]
*  I mean, we've been talking about this topic of retribution, right? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1176.14s)]
*  And we have heard comments from the president's allies, including some in Congress who have [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1179.8600000000001s)]
*  talked about wanting to pursue investigations of those that were on the committee set up [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1184.74s)]
*  to investigate the attack on the Capitol. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1190.78s)]
*  That is looking back. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1193.8999999999999s)]
*  It's just looking back in a way that aligns with the president's political priorities. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1195.16s)]
*  It's the completion of the rewriting of that history. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1199.26s)]
*  Will Congress, Maggie, officially, I mean, is this going to happen? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1202.28s)]
*  Is Congress going to investigate the investigation of January 6th? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1205.24s)]
*  Yes, and they have already. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1209.3s)]
*  This is not new. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1210.8s)]
*  They did in the previous Congress, too. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1211.8s)]
*  But this is going to be, I think, a different level of this than what we have heard before. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1214.46s)]
*  Look, Michael, we know that Trump was very upset that President Biden issued preemptive [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1218.5s)]
*  pardons to people who worked on the House Select Committee investigating the lead up [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1223.54s)]
*  to January 6th and the day itself. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1227.78s)]
*  And so I think you will hear that as justification for why this is happening. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1230.3s)]
*  But in reality, I suspect this was going to happen anyway. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1234.14s)]
*  You have cued up my final question to you all, which is about the pardons that outgoing [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1238.24s)]
*  President Biden issued for his family members. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1242.9s)]
*  And as you just said, Maggie, for members of the January 6th committee and for Dr. Anthony [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1247.24s)]
*  Fauci and Mark Milley, I want to read you something that our esteemed colleague Ezra [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1251.98s)]
*  Klein wrote about that decision. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1259.18s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1262.42s)]
*  Quote, the Biden of 2020 would have done none of this. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1263.42s)]
*  In key cases like the family pardons, he said he would not do this and then he did. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1269.22s)]
*  This feels in its own way like Biden's submission to the new regime by which Ezra means Trump. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1275.06s)]
*  The powers of the presidency are whatever the president is allowed to get away with. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1281.94s)]
*  Well, I think that's actually always been true. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1287.82s)]
*  It's just that presidents have tended to try to abide by norms. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1290.74s)]
*  I don't know that, and I have enormous respect for Ezra. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1294.3s)]
*  And he's not even here to defend himself. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1297.02s)]
*  I'll send him an email saying the same thing. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1298.82s)]
*  I don't know that I would describe this as sort of submission to the new presidency. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1301.74s)]
*  I think President Biden had enough agency that he didn't have to do something he said [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1305.98s)]
*  he wasn't going to do. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1309.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think that people have to own their own choices. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1310.66s)]
*  And at a certain point, the broad excuse of I had to do X because Trump, I don't think [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1313.34s)]
*  has served Democrats especially well over the last eight years. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1320.86s)]
*  Those pardons are not all the same. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1326.06s)]
*  I've talked to a bunch of former Biden administration officials, most of whom felt as if the ones [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1328.52s)]
*  for Fauci and Mark Milley they understood. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1334.54s)]
*  Those are both older men who were clearly going to be targeted in very specific ways. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1337.34s)]
*  Mark Milley was risking getting recalled to active duty and court-martialed and all kinds [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1342.0s)]
*  of punishments like that. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1346.1399999999999s)]
*  The House Select Committee preemptive pardons, most people I spoke to in the administration [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1350.04s)]
*  did not love them. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1355.92s)]
*  The family member ones are the ones that people were very upset about. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1357.44s)]
*  I'm putting aside Hunter Biden, which most people in Biden's world defended. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1360.64s)]
*  But the preemptive pardons for various members of Biden's family struck them as a misuse [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1365.3600000000001s)]
*  of that power. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1370.68s)]
*  Some of the Democrats who received a pardon didn't think it was a good idea. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1371.8000000000002s)]
*  Members of the committee? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1375.3200000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1376.3200000000002s)]
*  Adam Schiff saying that he thought it was unwise to receive a pardon. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1377.3200000000002s)]
*  Got a pardon anyway. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1379.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1380.0400000000002s)]
*  He did. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1381.0400000000002s)]
*  Now, some did want one. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1382.0400000000002s)]
*  Benny Thompson, who was also on the J6 committee, was in conversations with the White House [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1384.96s)]
*  about this. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1391.0s)]
*  And he did say that he was open to receiving one. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1392.48s)]
*  But just by the comments of some of those who received it and sort of the mixed responses, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  you can see just how sort of polarizing this was. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1400.24s)]
*  I want to end on this. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1404.1200000000001s)]
*  In an interview a couple of nights ago with Sean Hannity, Donald Trump noted who outgoing [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1405.1200000000001s)]
*  President Biden did not give a pardon to. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1411.54s)]
*  This guy went around giving everybody pardons. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1415.18s)]
*  And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn't give himself a pardon. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1417.42s)]
*  He noted that Biden did not give a pardon to himself. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1424.7s)]
*  If you look at it, it all had to do with him. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1427.1s)]
*  Is that a threat? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1429.94s)]
*  Well, it was interesting. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1430.94s)]
*  Sounds a little bit like a threat. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1433.94s)]
*  What Trump proceeded to talk about was alleged moneymaking by President Biden before he was [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1435.6599999999999s)]
*  president, that he was accusing Biden of having taken in all kinds of money from work [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1441.4s)]
*  that his relatives were doing off his name, essentially. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1448.0400000000002s)]
*  Again, prior to the presidency, Biden's been in Washington forever. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1450.92s)]
*  I'm going to point out what listeners may recognize as a bit of an irony of Trump accusing [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1453.68s)]
*  relatives of a president of making money off of his name. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1458.02s)]
*  Putting that aside, Biden has the same immunity as President Trump has. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1461.24s)]
*  You know, the Supreme Court last year in a case related to President Trump's first term [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1467.12s)]
*  said that presidents have broad immunity for acts committed while in office. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1471.6799999999998s)]
*  But what President Trump was talking about were things predating the presidency. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1476.3999999999999s)]
*  And it does raise questions about whether he is going to try to push through some kinds [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1481.8s)]
*  of investigations. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1486.1s)]
*  So far, the administration has taken a series of very aggressive actions against people [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzm3qoJ1i90&t=1488.4599999999998s)]
