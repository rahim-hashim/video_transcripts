# A Deadly Aid Delivery and Growing Threat of Famine in Gaza
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LGmzycioCk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Late last week, an effort to get food into northern Gaza turned deadly as thousands of
*  desperate Gazans descended on aid trucks and Israeli troops tasked with guarding those
*  trucks opened fire.
*  But exactly how people died and who was responsible remains contested.
*  Today, my colleague Hiba Yazbek on what we know about what happened and what it tells
*  us about hunger in Gaza.
*  It's Tuesday, March 5th.
*  So Hiba, we are now in the fifth month of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.
*  And for weeks, we've been hearing about negotiations over a ceasefire and a hostage exchange.
*  And then late last week, there was a disaster surrounding an aid convoy that was brought
*  into Gaza.
*  You've been reporting on what happened.
*  Tell us about it.
*  So last Thursday, there was a deadly disaster involving civilians, possibly the deadliest
*  disaster since the war started nearly five months ago, in which 118 Palestinians were
*  killed and more than 760 were wounded in Gaza City.
*  But there are conflicting reports on how they died and what exactly happened.
*  The Israeli military has one account of what happened and the Gaza Health Ministry and
*  witnesses have another account.
*  So my colleagues and I started digging into the details.
*  We started calling people, piecing together a picture of what had actually happened there.
*  And what did you find when you guys started really looking into this?
*  So first, let me just give you the context of what happened.
*  This happened in northern Gaza, the place that has been at war the longest.
*  That's where Israeli ground forces began their invasion of the Gaza Strip.
*  Many people have left the north, but we do know that some 300,000 people are still there.
*  And the people who have remained there are really living through very desperate conditions.
*  Very little aid has come in to the north of Gaza since the war started, and especially
*  in recent weeks.
*  And food is barely available for the people who've remained there.
*  And the UN has been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory.
*  And Heba, why is there so little aid getting into northern Gaza in particular?
*  Well, first of all, there's less aid getting into the Gaza Strip in general, not just the
*  north.
*  There's multiple reasons as to why that is.
*  One of the main reasons is that Israel itself has been very slow to approve permits and
*  often denies permits for aid trucks and aid convoys to come in, specifically to the north.
*  Because Israel says that they don't want the aid to end up in the hands of Hamas, that
*  they don't want them to get a hold of the packages.
*  Got it.
*  When Israel does approve the permits and the aid trucks start their journeys, there's multiple
*  hurdles that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people.
*  Some of these hurdles include the widespread destruction in Gaza.
*  There's vast damage across the Gaza Strip.
*  Roads have been destroyed.
*  There's rubble everywhere.
*  And it's very difficult for the trucks to actually move through that rubble and through
*  those roads.
*  These aid convoys have to go through multiple Israeli checkpoints on the way.
*  And there's often significant delays at these checkpoints by Israeli soldiers who are inspecting
*  the aid.
*  This makes it hard for the trucks to make it from where they enter in the south all
*  the way to the north in the specific safety window that they're given.
*  And sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed
*  so much that they can't keep going.
*  But there's a particular problem with the north where fighting has been going on the
*  longest.
*  The civil order is now breaking down, essentially.
*  We know that frequent Israeli strikes on Palestinian policemen meant that there's really no one
*  to run security for official groups and for aid convoys, leaving them vulnerable to attacks
*  by local gangs who are trying to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it.
*  And also hungry and desperate civilians who are trying to grab the aid and take as much
*  as they can, which means that they end up stealing some of it, looting some of it while
*  it's still on the way.
*  Right.
*  So it's like lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown.
*  This is kind of the downstream effects of extended war in a particular place.
*  There's a power vacuum.
*  And that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the United Nations to
*  be able to operate safely.
*  Right.
*  And the few aid trucks that do come in have had to either suspend their aid deliveries
*  into the north or have not been able to deliver aid there.
*  The last time Anarwa, the UN agency in charge of Palestinian refugees, tried to bring trucks
*  to the north was nearly a month ago.
*  They said that one of their convoys came under fire.
*  And another major aid provider, the World Food Program, said that they haven't delivered
*  aid there in over three weeks.
*  And they cited all of the reasons we talked about for this suspension.
*  So while aid hasn't been coming into the north, people have been growing more desperate
*  and hungry and the situation there has been getting worse, which has been raising international
*  alarm.
*  And there's been increased calls on Israel to let aid go through to the north and to
*  alleviate the suffering of the residents there.
*  So Israel partnered with these local Palestinian businessmen in Gaza and they promised to secure
*  the aid convoys that the businessmen would supply and that would make their way into
*  the north.
*  And they successfully did this three times last week.
*  So people started being very hopeful that more would come.
*  And ahead of the fourth delivery, they started to gather at this distribution point right
*  outside of Gaza City in the north.
*  And that brings us to Thursday's incident.
*  So last Thursday around 4.45am, around 38 aid trucks reached this distribution point
*  and they start getting closer to the crowds of people who had camped there overnight waiting
*  for this aid to come.
*  And when the people see the trucks coming, they're very desperate.
*  They surround them.
*  They get on top of them.
*  And then at some point, Israeli soldiers start firing shots.
*  And then it turned violent very fast.
*  And it ended with 118 Palestinians dead and 760 injured.
*  And this is where the accounts diverge.
*  Okay, so let's start with the Israeli account.
*  What did they say happened?
*  So the Israeli military said that it was trying to secure the convoy and it had tanks nearby
*  to make sure that the convoy reached the area.
*  And it did acknowledge that its troops had opened fire at the crowd.
*  They said that they opened fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approached their troops
*  and endangered their lives.
*  And they said the shots that were fired weren't really the reason why so many people died.
*  But the reason that so many people died was because in the chaos of all of it, they trampled
*  each other and many had died from suffocation or trampling and also that the trucks had
*  run over some of the people who were trying to run away.
*  Oh, God.
*  So the Israelis don't deny actually shooting, but they say it was more about controlling
*  the crowd kind of as warning shots type thing and that this was not the way people actually
*  died.
*  They say the way people actually died was suffocation or being crushed by the aid trucks
*  themselves.
*  Right.
*  And what did the Gazan health authorities say?
*  So the Gazan health authorities have actually been calling this the Flower Massacre or the
*  Massacre of the Hungry Stomachs because what they're saying is that Israeli forces fired
*  at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who are waiting for aid.
*  And witnesses and Palestinians who were there have said that although some people were trampled
*  and possibly run over by the trucks, that was not the main reason for the high death
*  toll.
*  Most of the people who were injured or killed were injured and killed by Israeli fire.
*  So the Gazan health authorities are essentially saying this was a massacre by Israel.
*  Right.
*  Do we know, Heba, what actually did happen?
*  What have you guys found in your reporting?
*  Well, the Israeli military released drone footage that it claimed showed a mass stampede
*  trampled, but that video only added to the confusion of the sequence of events and the
*  quality and the lengths of the clips made it more difficult to confirm these claims.
*  Right.
*  It was just grainy.
*  There was no sound.
*  You saw people scramble and run, but you didn't understand why.
*  Right.
*  The drone footage was heavily edited and it left out key moments, but it did show hundreds
*  of people circling around the trucks and hoping to catch a bag of flour.
*  And then suddenly we see people start to panic and run in multiple directions.
*  And then they released another clip in which we see two Israeli tanks that are positioned
*  about a quarter mile down the road.
*  And then we see about a dozen bodies lying around them and we see people crawling and
*  ducking for cover.
*  But we did have another video that was released by Al Jazeera and it showed a crowd near the
*  A convoy.
*  And it also captured the sound of gunfire and showed multiple tracer rounds, which is
*  a special type of ammunition that helps troops fine tune their targeting when it's dark.
*  And the tracer rounds originated from the direction of a nearby Israeli military base.
*  So although that did not conclude that the shots came from the direction of the Israeli
*  military, it did add another layer of evidence.
*  So it sounds like these videos are suggestive, but not conclusive.
*  But what did the people you spoke to on the ground say?
*  The eyewitnesses and survivors and doctors you spoke with?
*  Right.
*  We spoke to witnesses and survivors, as well as doctors at the hospitals that have taken
*  the people who are wounded and killed.
*  And they said that most of the people had died or were wounded by gunshots.
*  And the doctor who runs one of the four main hospitals in the area that took in the casualties
*  told me that out of the 13 people who were killed and the 170 people who are wounded
*  that the hospital took in, all of the injuries were of gunshot wounds.
*  He said that they didn't see any injuries that coincided with those of a stampede or
*  people being run over by trucks.
*  And that account echoes the ones that we've heard from witnesses and people who were there
*  who saw people get shot and fall to the ground next to them.
*  But in the chaos of everything, people were not checking who's dead and who's wounded.
*  They were just taking the flower and they were running for their lives.
*  And although the accounts differ on both sides, what we do know is that many hungry and desperate
*  people died while trying to get food and secure aid in a place where famine is looming and
*  starvation is rampant.
*  And that's what I spent the last few weeks reporting on.
*  I'm trying to understand how people in the north of Gaza specifically are surviving with
*  such little food.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Hiba, I want to talk about what people are doing to survive in northern Gaza.
*  But before we get to that, what is the big picture on the state of hunger in Gaza?
*  Hunger has reached unprecedented levels in Gaza and specifically in northern Gaza.
*  And we're starting to already see reports of children dying from malnutrition and dehydration.
*  And this week, the health ministry said that 15 children have died from malnutrition and
*  dehydration at just one of northern Gaza's hospitals.
*  Wow, 15 children have actually died?
*  Yes.
*  And we also have the UN and aid organizations saying that one in six children in northern
*  Gaza were acutely malnutritioned and that more than 90% of children under two are facing
*  severe food poverty.
*  And the UN humanitarian coordinator said that a quarter of all Gaza residents are
*  one step away from famine.
*  And how exactly are people surviving, Hiba?
*  I mean, you're talking to people in northern Gaza.
*  What are they saying?
*  I've been reporting on hunger for weeks and I've talked to people about what they're
*  doing in order to survive with such little food.
*  And I recently talked to one woman whose experience is very typical in northern Gaza.
*  Her name is Ghada Krayem.
*  She's a 23-year-old woman from the north who stayed in the north and didn't flee.
*  And tell me about Ghada.
*  Ghada is one of 10 kids.
*  She has six sisters and three brothers.
*  And she's actually Gaza's first female solar power engineer.
*  She's won many awards internationally.
*  And she's also the sole provider for her family.
*  And she's used the money that she won from these grants and competitions to help her
*  family through this war.
*  And with that money, she actually stockpiled a bunch of food in the beginning of the war,
*  expecting the situation to deteriorate.
*  She bought flour and milk and canned food and everything they might need.
*  And they stockpiled it in their home.
*  And how is it that they're still in northern Gaza?
*  Well, actually, they tried to stay in their home for as long as they possibly could until
*  the ground fighting really basically reached their doorstep.
*  And at one point early on during Israel's ground invasion of the north, Israeli soldiers
*  came to their building and they forced them out.
*  They asked everyone to leave the building and they detained all of the men and the boys
*  who were later released.
*  And she was forced to leave with nothing.
*  They took nothing with them like many other Gazans.
*  And they moved.
*  They moved 12 times since.
*  One of those times was to the south, where they got there and they realized that it actually
*  wasn't much safer.
*  It wasn't better for them.
*  So they realized that they should probably just go back to the north and stay as close
*  as possible to their home in case they're able to go back later.
*  That never happened because Israeli forces took up their home as a military base and
*  they were there for two weeks, she said.
*  And after they'd left, two weeks later, she went back to check on her home and it was
*  burned.
*  There was nothing left, including the food that she'd stockpiled.
*  And now she's sheltering with 50 members of her extended family, including children in
*  a two-bedroom apartment in the north.
*  50 people in a two-bedroom apartment.
*  That is extraordinary.
*  So what did they do for food early in the war?
*  Well, she told me that in the beginning of the war, they still were able to find some
*  things to buy and eat like rice and vegetables.
*  But she said that by the end of December, basically, when aid to the north became less
*  frequent and things that they were eating had started to run out, including flour, which
*  became much less available and much more expensive, they didn't know what to do.
*  I mean, they had nothing to eat, so they started mixing water with starch to eat.
*  They were having one meal a day and the children were constantly hungry.
*  So they had to find an alternative.
*  And that alternative was animal food.
*  So she told me that they started grinding up really any animal food that they could
*  So rabbit food and bird food and hay and fodder, really anything that they could get their
*  hands on.
*  And they would use that to make bread with.
*  But the bread was very dry and it smelled bad.
*  It tasted bad and it made their stomachs hurt.
*  But she said that the one that was the worst for her was the bird food.
*  She said the bird food tasted and smelled as if you were sitting with a bunch of chicken.
*  The smell was very bad and the taste was even worse.
*  But she told me that even though this stuff tasted and smelled bad, they really tried
*  to make it as less awful as possible.
*  She told me that one of her cousins sheltering with her loved to bake and she made really
*  tasty sweets before the war.
*  So basically she tried to make the most out of these ingredients.
*  And she was making desserts using the cornmeal and the rabbit food.
*  And she was also making other savory dishes that they liked and they ate frequently before
*  the war.
*  She used the animal feed to make maftool, which is the Palestinian version of couscous.
*  So she was making it with the ground up animal feed.
*  Yes, but that was still not enough.
*  At that point, Ghada and her family were only eating one meal a day.
*  And that was not enough for them or the children in the family.
*  She told me that her little sister, two-year-old Elin, who's actually the youngest person sheltering
*  with them, was hungry all the time.
*  She was going to sleep crying and waking up crying and she loved milk, but they ran
*  out of milk more than two months ago.
*  So what they've been doing is basically giving her expired juice.
*  It was actually not even juice, it's a concentrated juice that they would mix with water.
*  And because it was expired, it was making her sick.
*  But that was the only thing that they could give her in place of milk.
*  When they were able to, they would give her sugar cane that they would find in the market
*  and lemons as a snack.
*  And sometimes when those weren't even available, they would just give her gum to chew on and
*  stop crying to silence her hunger.
*  So I asked her if they had been able to get any aid since the war started.
*  And she told me that her brother, Mohammed, who's 30 years old, had been going to the
*  distribution site and sleeping on the beach just waiting for aid.
*  He would leave at seven in the morning and come back at three a.m. and he slept there
*  for three days this week.
*  So her brother had been sleeping on the beach in hopes that there would be aid dropped off
*  here.
*  So what happened?
*  So after waiting for hours near the distribution site on Thursday, he saw the aid trucks coming
*  and along with the crowd, he ran towards them.
*  And suddenly, when the chaos erupted, he just started seeing people dropping to the ground.
*  And he's actually deaf and mute.
*  So he didn't know what was happening.
*  He just saw people get shot and fall to the ground in front of him.
*  She told me that he saw someone get shot in the head right next to him.
*  And in the middle of all the chaos and the bloodshed, he was actually able to grab a
*  bag of flour.
*  And he just took it and started running really fast.
*  He was just trying to get away and hold on to that bag of flour that he was able to get.
*  And while leaving the site, he saw this little kid who was also able to grab a bag of flour.
*  But she said that he told her that the kid was stopped by local gang members who had
*  attacked him and grabbed the bag of flour from him.
*  They stole it from him.
*  And Radha's brother just kept running until he got home finally.
*  And he came home after three days of sleeping in the sand with a bag of flour.
*  Got a terrifying night.
*  That was the first time they've had flour in months since December, basically.
*  So obviously, they wanted to make bread.
*  But that bag was a 25 kilogram bag of flour.
*  And again, there were 50 people sheltering in one apartment.
*  So they had to make it last them as long as possible so it could feed all the members
*  of the family.
*  So actually, what they're doing now is they're mixing the flour with animal feed still.
*  They're doing one cup of flour with three cups of animal feed to stretch it out for
*  as long as possible.
*  And they're making bread with it.
*  She said that it was better, but still not normal bread.
*  It was not what they were craving.
*  You know, they've been through so much since the war started.
*  They've seen people killed.
*  They've seen dead bodies.
*  They've been displaced 12 times.
*  They've lost friends and family members.
*  But she said that now with the hunger and the starvation in the north, it's really the
*  worst thing they've gone through since the beginning of the war.
*  She said that she's seeing people, kids who are rummaging through trash trying to find
*  anything to eat.
*  And so she said that people were still going back to that same distribution site.
*  She even said that more people were going back on the beach and waiting and camping
*  out and sleeping there, hoping for more aid to come.
*  And she also said that her brother, Muhammad, was also going back every day since Thursday,
*  hoping to get another bag of flour because he was so hungry that he wanted to eat anything
*  and risking his life for a bag of flour was worth it.
*  Despite the fact that so many people had died on Thursday trying to get flour, the fact
*  that some people did come home with a bag of flour, that was enough for them and others
*  to go back there in hopes that more was going to come.
*  Bye bye.
*  Hiba, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  Over the weekend, the Biden administration air-dropped food into Gaza for the first time,
*  and Vice President Kamala Harris called for a ceasefire, a position she pressed with a
*  member of Israel's war cabinet, Benny Gantz, at the White House on Monday.
*  Meanwhile, 15 trucks were dispatched to northern Gaza on Monday, but at least five were looted
*  along the way, and it was unclear how many reached their intended destination.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not bar former President Donald Trump
*  from running for another term, rejecting a challenge to Trump's eligibility that had
*  threatened to upend the presidential race.
*  The case arose from a challenge brought by Colorado voters who cited Section 3 of the
*  14th Amendment, a provision adopted after the Civil War to forbid those who had taken
*  an oath to support the Constitution from holding office if they engaged in insurrection.
*  The justices agreed that individual states may not bar candidates from the presidency
*  under that constitutional provision.
*  It was a unanimous decision that was largely expected.
*  And a United Nations report released on Monday found, quote, reasonable grounds to believe
*  that sexual violence, including rape, was committed in at least three locations in Israel
*  during the October 7th attack, the Nova Music Festival site, Road 232, and Kibbutz Reim.
*  The experts also said they had found circumstantial evidence that could indicate sexual violence
*  had occurred with a number of victims, mostly women, who were found fully or partially naked,
*  bound, and shot.
*  In addition, the UN group said it had found clear and convincing information based on
*  firsthand accounts from released hostages that sexual violence, including rape, was
*  inflicted against some women during their time in captivity in Gaza.
*  The report said that the UN team had also heard accounts of sexual violence against
*  Palestinians that implicated Israeli security forces and settlers.
*  Today's episode was produced by Sydney Harper, Rochelle Banja, and Lindsay Garrison.

*  Lozano, and Alicia Bitu, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
