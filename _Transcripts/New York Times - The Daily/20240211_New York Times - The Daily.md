# The Sunday Read: ‘The Unthinkable Mental Health Crisis That Shook a New England College’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbmw7Zo6cWA)
*  My name is Jordan Kissner. I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times magazine, and
*  I've been teaching writing to university students for most of the last 10 years.
*  This week's Sunday Read is my story for the magazine about a cluster of suicides that
*  struck a small university in Massachusetts between 2021 and 2022. I wrote about how the
*  mental health crisis among college-age students is affecting the staff who teach and care
*  for them, and how it's shaping the broader institution of college in the United States.
*  So in the summer of 2021, students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, which is a STEM-focused
*  university of about 5,000 undergraduates, received an email from their administration.
*  A rising senior had died, and the Boston Globe leader reported it as a suicide. Then, a few
*  days before classes started, news of a second suicide appeared in the students' inboxes.
*  And then by the end of September, a third. It was every academic institution's worst
*  nightmare, a row of self-inflicted student deaths, proceeding more or less with one death
*  a month for six months. The students who took their lives hadn't really shown any of the
*  conventional warning signs. There was this helpless feeling among professors. Any of
*  their students could be at lethal risk, and they might not know. And one terrifying aspect
*  of a suicide cluster like this is that you never know if another death is coming or when.
*  And so the university's president at the time formed a task force that would evaluate
*  in as data-based a way as possible what factors might be contributing to this mental health
*  emergency. What struck me was that in the midst of this moment of intense panic and
*  improvisation, staff members started doing things that in the past might have been seen
*  as overly involved or too generous. The school encouraged professors to start talking about
*  their own mental health struggles in class if they were comfortable. One professor I spoke to
*  gave out his cell phone number and would text students to make sure they were okay if he didn't
*  see them in class. Another I spoke with stocked up a fridge with chili so that students would
*  never need to worry about affording dinner. The dean of arts and sciences started making a point
*  to look students and staff in the eye because she noticed that as all this was happening,
*  people stopped looking at each other head on. It was almost too vulnerable, she thought,
*  and she wanted people to know that they weren't alone even if they were too shut down in the
*  moment to receive that message. I was really moved by these small gestures in the face of
*  an enormous tragedy, but I also wanted to know how taking on these pseudo-therapeutic roles was
*  affecting faculty members. The issue of mental health crises in college students isn't new.
*  A national institutes of health study from a decade ago found that about 1,100 college
*  students were dying by suicide each year and about 24,000 were attempting it. But that was
*  10 years ago, that was before the pandemic. And since 2020, faculty told me, there's been
*  a general sense of deluge when it comes to mental health on campuses.
*  Professors have always been used to having some subset of students in class who were struggling
*  about whom they were concerned, but the numbers became more than they knew how to handle.
*  What emerged from my reporting is this story of immense distress about a bunch of educators
*  trying to shepherd students in crisis while themselves feeling overwhelmed, burnt out,
*  and a little bit under-resourced. But it's also a story of educators who were willing to be creative,
*  responsive, and adaptive to lift their community out of a crisis like this over and over and over
*  again. People I spoke with at WPI stressed to me that the way you get through something like this
*  as a community is openness, transparency about the hurt that's happening, and that no individual,
*  no one counseling center, no one overachieving professor can solve this kind of problem alone.
*  You only get out the other side through the immense and loving work of many, many, many,
*  many people. And that's a hard thing to implement on a policy level, but at WPI, that was what it
*  took. So here's my article, The Unthinkable Mental Health Crisis That Shook a New England College,
*  read by Emily Wu-Zeller. Our audio producer today is Adrienne Hurst,
*  and the original music you'll hear was written and performed by Erin Esposito.
*  The first death happened before the academic year began. In July 2021, an undergraduate
*  student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute was reported dead. The administration sent a notice
*  out over email, with the familiar, thoroughly vetted phrasing and appended resources. Catherine
*  Fu, an assistant professor in the Department of Integrative and Global Studies, felt especially
*  crushed by the news. She taught this student. He was Chinese American, and she felt connected to
*  the particular set of pressures he faced. She read through old anonymous course evaluations,
*  looking for any sign she might have missed. But she was unsure where to put her personal
*  feelings about a loss suffered in this professional context. What was the appropriate
*  channel for processing, either with co-workers or students, the sorrow and fear that the death of
*  a student inspired? Fu went on preparing for her fall classes. The week before the academic year
*  began, a second student died. A rising senior in the computer science department who loved
*  horticulture took his own life. This brought an intimation of disaster. One student's suicide is
*  a tragedy. Two might be the beginning of a cluster. Some faculty members began to feel a tinge of
*  dread when they stepped onto campus. Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts is a tidy
*  New England college campus with the high-saturation landscaping typical of well-funded
*  institutions. The hedges are beautifully trimmed. The pathways are swept clean. Red brick buildings
*  from the 19th century fraternize with high glass facades and renovated interiors, a new sports
*  complex, a new well-being center. Students were still not allowed to congregate in large groups,
*  so the lush quads and dining halls were eerily silent.
*  The following Wednesday, students began classes, with the option of zooming in from their dorms.
*  Some WPI faculty members continued scaled-down versions of teaching strategies they developed
*  during the pandemic, pre-recording lectures, holding seminars over Zoom, and experimenting
*  with ways to have lab sessions with only 12 students present.
*  Fastening air glasses to the heads of the 12 so everyone else could watch from their dorms
*  had not worked very well. The glasses ran out of battery power too soon, and they gave people
*  headaches. The leaves began to turn in Worcester. WPI had possible risk factors for mental health
*  issues and suicide among the student body. Its academic culture was fast-paced and intense,
*  the enrolled students skewed male. There was a comparatively high number of neurodivergent
*  and introverted students who might struggle to maintain the social bonds that help protect
*  against psychological challenges. But then, in 2021, risk factors for every type of student
*  were elevated. Charlie Morse, who was the school's director of counseling from 2006 to 2021
*  and is now the dean of student wellness, told me that until that point in his tenure,
*  WPI had lost two students to suicide, well below the national average. Still, he had seen the worst
*  case play out at other schools. Morse is a slender, soft-voiced man in his early 60s.
*  He has worked at the school for more than 30 years. When he tried to describe to me what it
*  felt like to come to work in the fall of 2021, there was a tremor in his voice. It's like,
*  oh please, not us, he told me, sitting in his office recently. Not us. He swallowed.
*  A third student died before September was up.
*  It was a very dark time on campus, Fu told me. Faculty were being asked to take on a role that
*  I think historically we haven't been asked to play. Her own anxiety intensified. She felt
*  herself tensing any time she looked at her work email. Even when there was no crisis announcement,
*  faculty and staff members flooded one another's inboxes with long group email chains,
*  processing fear and rage that had nowhere else to go. Their lives were also upended by the
*  isolation, illness, and chaos of the pandemic. Simultaneously, they felt as if they were the
*  first-line responders to students in crisis. But they weren't trained or equipped for the level of
*  distress. Our brain could get used to almost anything, says Jean King, the Dean of the
*  Arts and Sciences and a professor in the Biology and Biotechnology Department.
*  But we can't get used to something that's unpredictable.
*  King is a distinguished scientist who has spent decades researching the neuroscience of stress,
*  in particular the way in which Black Americans and other oppressed people experience the
*  physiological effects of systemic disadvantage. King, who is a Black woman, is known on campus
*  for being passionate, warm, and wedded to her job. She explained to me that stress becomes toxic,
*  and resilience becomes harder when the stressor seems random and erratic.
*  If it's unpredictable, my brain doesn't know what to expect next, she told me. That's not a
*  place my brain likes. No brain likes it. So my brain is experiencing two things. It can't predict
*  what's going to happen, and it can't control it if it does happen. So it has no way of getting
*  ready for the situation. In the wake of the third death, the university set up an emergency task
*  force with a mandate to determine the possible causes of extreme student distress. Their job was
*  to recommend data-backed interventions to the growing mental health crisis on campus.
*  The university's mental health and wellness protocols had always been aligned with the
*  leading edge of best practices, but evidently the industry's best practices weren't sufficient
*  anymore. Something had changed. What was it? What should come next?
*  Worcester Polytechnic is a STEM-focused research university, and its curriculum emphasizes project-
*  based learning. Students train toward junior and senior year projects that involve real-life impact,
*  like developing a low-cost device to feed premature infants, or running analyses of
*  the distribution system for Panama's National Water Authority to identify opportunities to
*  minimize shortages. Robots the size of small coolers on wheels scuttle around the quads,
*  delivering food to students in their dorms or labs. The task force, led by King alongside Matt Berry,
*  who was Morris's assistant director at the counseling center, and including faculty and
*  staff members and students from every part of the school, was also structured like a group project,
*  first gathering data about what was wrong, then analyzing the data for patterns before
*  recommending strategies for new policy. A second task force would oversee implementation.
*  WPI also asked the Riverside Trauma Center, a Boston-area organization that specializes
*  in crisis response and the aftermath of traumatic events, to conduct an independent review of the
*  school's mental health practices. It might have felt better, a few members of the task force
*  suggested to me, if the university had leaped immediately to action, especially when the
*  community was hurting and frightened. But members of the task force thought that designing an
*  intervention without first clearly defining the scope and nature of the problem was irrational
*  and ineffectual. This is a community of empiricists.
*  Depending on their position on campus, everyone had a different opinion of what the problem was
*  and how we needed to solve it. Kimberly LeChasser, a researcher and data analyst at the Morgan Teaching
*  and Learning Center who helped design the task force's research phase, told me,
*  the idea was to get as neutral and comprehensive an understanding of the problem as possible,
*  not limited by any one perspective. The task force organized a series of town hall events
*  and listening sessions at which students could talk about their experiences of stress, anxiety,
*  depression, and isolation. A series of smaller group conversations were used to assess particular
*  experiences of stress. Black students spoke with one another, led by a black professor.
*  LGBTQ plus students and first generation students did the same, and so on. The school
*  hosted town hall events for faculty and staff members and parents. Everyone on campus was
*  invited to complete a written survey. Among the professors, especially the
*  junior teaching faculty, female professors, and scholars of color, there was consistent talk of
*  burnout. Fu, who had joined the task force, was struck by this. We heard from a lot of faculty
*  that they were just very overwhelmed by the need for students to find a sympathetic ear and some
*  guidance. The students also reported feeling burned out and overwhelmed, specifically citing
*  the feeling that their ability to perform academically was demanded at the expense of
*  their feelings, health, and humanity. The picture that emerged from the town halls wasn't altogether
*  different from the complaints coming out of universities all over the country during the
*  pandemic. More work than anyone could healthfully manage, less community resilience than people
*  needed, anxiety about what variables the future might bring, and no sense of when it would end.
*  The fourth death came late at night. It was November, and King was in bed next to her husband,
*  a psychiatrist at a nearby hospital. She assumed the ringing cell phone was his because he was
*  sometimes on call. Then he said, Gene, it's your phone. Her caller ID told her that it was Leshen,
*  the president of the college. So she rose from the bed and went to their bathroom.
*  She remembers Leshen's voice sounding heavy. We lost another one.
*  After the call ended, she went downstairs and screamed.
*  I'm sure the entire neighborhood heard me, King says. She hadn't known this student personally,
*  but she feels passionately, she told me, that all WPI students are her kids. And she felt overcome
*  by horror at what was unfolding, seemingly unstoppable among her students. I just lost it
*  because we had finally brought people together, she said. Her mind began racing. What are we doing
*  wrong? What do we need to do to make this go away? What do I have to do personally? What do I need
*  from the community? She felt at a total loss. How are we going to do this?
*  In classes, professors began to experiment with coping strategies.
*  Did they need to be more relaxed about deadlines, lighten coursework, pursue tighter connections
*  with students who seemed withdrawn? Steve Kamiotech, a professor of practice in chemical
*  engineering who joined the task force, explained to me that part of what was so terrifying
*  was that the deaths didn't match previous patterns. Kamiotech had known to keep an eye on
*  students who seemed withdrawn or disheveled, students who stopped coming to class or exhibited
*  erratic behavior, students whose grades dipped. But one of his students was among the dead,
*  and this student hadn't shown any of those signs.
*  Actually, none of the dead students matched the profile of a suicide risk.
*  That was frightening, Kamiotech said. He looked down at the table in his office.
*  And he can't help but, could I have spotted it? Could I have done something?
*  Kamiotech, who was 65, took to giving out his cell phone number and checking in personally
*  with students he knew were stressed, a method several other professors I spoke to mentioned
*  adopting, even though they didn't exactly have the time or bandwidth for that level of tabs keeping.
*  The job of calculating what this new era required, meanwhile, came to rest in part on the shoulders
*  of data analysts like LaShasser and Stacey Shaw, who was then a new assistant professor of
*  psychological and cognitive sciences. The two women were part of a team assigned to take the
*  quantitative data that had come in via surveys, as well as the recordings and transcripts of student,
*  faculty, staff, and parent feedback, and run an analysis that would explain, with the certainty
*  of numbers, what was going wrong. The team coded all the transcripts and survey responses,
*  identifying recurring phrases and key words, and then looking to see how often they were spoken
*  and by whom. Which key words and phrases occurred most frequently together? From which parties?
*  Running multiple increasingly complex analyses, they began to identify patterns. Which members
*  of the campus community were most affected by which kinds of stress, and how were they
*  experiencing that stress academically and personally? LaShasser and Shaw worked together
*  only on Zoom and over email, working past midnight most nights and on the weekends too,
*  haunted by the feeling that they were racing against the clock.
*  By the way, when you do this as a researcher, this can take years, LaShasser told me. We were
*  doing this in a month or two. I was sitting with the two women in Shaw's office, a shady, spacious
*  nook at the far end of one of the campus's newer buildings, with a large window overlooking wild
*  grasses. They had embraced at the beginning of our interview. Though they spent the winter of 2021
*  to 22 in constant contact, they had never met in person. We were flying by the seat of our pants,
*  Shaw recalled. It never felt like enough, and it never felt fast enough, because it kept happening.
*  And every time it did, no matter how much good work you did or how much students said they
*  appreciated whatever you did, you felt like you failed, over and over again.
*  The fifth death was a graduate student who died of a seizure in November. The sixth was a senior
*  in the mechanical engineering department who killed himself while home over the holiday break.
*  The initial findings of the task force were distributed in January 2022. Three days after
*  the report came out, another student, a junior on the crew team, was found dead of an apparent
*  suicide in his off-campus apartment. This was perhaps the worst period on campus.
*  Seven students had died in six months. There was no precedent for dealing with loss like this.
*  No one knew when it would end, and the task force's implementation team had only just received a list
*  of recommendations. Following research that indicates that spending too much time talking
*  about or commemorating a student who has died by suicide can risk contagion, Morrison-Leschen
*  encouraged the faculty to retain as normal an educational experience as possible.
*  The university had organized no memorials or vigils.
*  Many students and parents found this baffling. Students published an open letter that February,
*  calling WPI's response to the deaths inconsistent and trauma-inducing, and suggesting that the lack
*  of time for group reflection and grief disregarded the gravity of recent tragedies.
*  A new student group called the Mental Health Committee organized a support walk for an evening
*  in February, at which students formed a candlelight processional and exchanged flowers to demonstrate
*  community resilience. Local florists donated thousands of flowers. Mothers from the community
*  lined up to give hugs to any student that needed one.
*  It felt like life or death, says Bryn Scott McWilliams, who was a freshman when she joined
*  the committee. It felt like the life of the student body was on our shoulders.
*  This was, of course, how the faculty and administration felt as well.
*  The pressure to get this right was immense, Morse told me. That winter, he would often see a truck
*  belonging to a document shredding company on his daily commute to work, and long more than anything
*  to be a shredder. Broadly, the analysis run by Lashasser and Shaw identified several issues
*  requiring immediate intervention. Intense academic pressure, insufficient self-care habits among the
*  students, lack of social connection, insufficient awareness of information about the existing health
*  resources at WPI, and pandemic burnout. The task force had several clear recommendations
*  that could be implemented almost immediately. Hire more counselors for the health center.
*  Increase the number of mental health trainings available to the faculty and staff.
*  Expand student mentoring programs. Build up social programming for students, giving them more
*  opportunities to make friends and feel connected to the campus community. Once a term, set aside
*  a day to cancel classes and meetings so that everyone could do something, not homework,
*  that would boost their well-being. Fu had served on a subcommittee dedicated to evaluating what
*  changes in pedagogy might be required to meet the moment. Their findings tracked with broader
*  trends in secondary education. It became really clear that we couldn't continue viewing students
*  exclusively in terms of how they performed in our classes, she said. We needed to understand
*  students as whole people, and we needed to develop a much more personalized approach.
*  The task force recommended that faculty members incorporate students' mental health and well-being
*  into their teaching priorities, whether that meant talking openly about their own struggles,
*  beginning class with meditation, or being more willing to grant student requests for extensions
*  or accommodations. Some professors balked. A lot of faculty were really pushing back and expressing
*  resistance, Fu said. You know, we weren't trained in this. I really don't feel comfortable engaging
*  with students in this way. Attending to individual student needs takes more time, Fu acknowledged,
*  and deciding how and whether to agree to student requests requires mental and ethical effort.
*  Some pleas for extensions or course adjustments can't be granted without making the instructor
*  workload unmanageable or risking unfairness to other students. Not all students feel comfortable
*  advocating for themselves, and often the most structurally disadvantaged students don't ask for
*  help. Is it fair to grant an extraordinary request to someone simply because they're emboldened
*  enough to ask? How is a professor supposed to evaluate whether a student need is acute enough
*  to make extraordinary accommodations? Earlier this year, the Healthy Minds study, which runs
*  surveys on the mental health of post-secondary students and faculty members, confirmed that this
*  extra work is unevenly distributed. Female, trans, and non-binary faculty members were much more
*  likely to be supporting students through mental health challenges than male faculty members.
*  Faculty members of color were more likely to do so than their white colleagues.
*  More junior, mid-career faculty members took on more of this work than late-career colleagues.
*  In other words, the people spending the most time addressing and accommodating student mental health
*  needs are the ones who are most likely to be lower paid, with less authority and less job security.
*  Adjunct and contingent faculty members often undertake this work at several jobs simultaneously
*  for separate institutions, without benefits. One way to think about this is as a cascade effect.
*  There's often a critical shortage of mental health professionals on campuses who can address
*  student need, particularly for Black, Latino, and Asian students. In the absence of sufficient
*  mental health scaffolding, faculty members have found themselves stepping into a new,
*  time-consuming dynamic with their students that doesn't always feel clearly defined or sustainable.
*  During one of my visits to WPI, I spoke with Zoe Reidinger, an associate professor of biomedical
*  engineering, and Adrienne Hall-Phillips, an associate professor of marketing in the business school.
*  They had each been asked to join the task force. We met in Reidinger's office, which is invitingly
*  decorated, with a fuzzy green couch that looked strikingly like the face of Oscar the Grouch,
*  and an extensive selection of tea. Reidinger's dog Lydia vied for a spot on the Oscar the Couch.
*  Hall-Phillips teaches in the business school and is the most senior Black female professor on campus,
*  in terms of years at WPI. Reidinger is non-binary and neurodivergent.
*  When they were hired, ten years ago, they were the only out queer faculty member on campus,
*  they told me. The two professors are close friends and act like beacons for minority students on
*  campus, even those they don't teach and have never met. We are resources for Black students
*  and queer students, and plenty of other others, Reidinger told me, smiling.
*  All the others, Hall-Phillips confirmed. It's something that we talk about all the time,
*  that this part of what we do is not actually in our job description.
*  They are inundated with student requests for advice, mentorship, and care. Hall-Phillips
*  lets students book individual appointments with her via an open calendar, with slots occurring
*  several days a week. As of that afternoon, the next open appointment was more than four weeks away.
*  She was also texting with a student who wanted to check in. She would later duck out of our
*  conversation early and catch the student during the walk to her next appointment.
*  Reidinger gets so many requests that they keep their schedule, and Lydia's, on their office door.
*  For a time, they stocked the refrigerator in their outer office with jars of chili for students who
*  might be worrying about how to afford dinner. I mentioned the concern about equity I saw in the
*  Healthy Minds study and heard about from faculty members that I interviewed all over the country.
*  Women, LGBTQ faculty members, and faculty members of color already face structural
*  disadvantages in academia when it comes to pay equity and securing tenure.
*  If these same faculty members spend vast reserves of time and energy caring for students in distress,
*  work that frequently goes unacknowledged, instead of completing research or traditional
*  administrative service work, that gap can widen further. Both of them seemed to sigh and laugh at
*  the same time. Am I pissed off about it? Hall-Phillips said tartly. Yes. Do I wish there
*  were some other individuals who would pick up a little bit more of the slack? Yes. Particularly
*  our white males. Reidinger snorted. But I can't focus on that because if I focus on that, the
*  students that are in need won't get the help they need. They just won't get it. And that's what's
*  more important to me. Both Reidinger and Hall-Phillips were emphatic that they love working at WPI.
*  They would like to see more faculty and staff members who look like them,
*  but broadly they think the administration cares immensely for its students and is doing a good job.
*  They know that when they need to refer a student for serious help, the student will receive it,
*  and they have direct lines and first-name relationships with the mental health professionals
*  in the counseling center. But they're also candid about the sacrifices they're making.
*  The 21-22 school year of chaos and sadness was a wake-up call for all of us, Hall-Phillips said.
*  Not just revamping all of our mental health resources on campus, but looking at faculty
*  and staff and recognizing, oh, they're burned out too. Oh, they're suffering too.
*  Were you burned out? I asked. Her face was flat. I still am, she said.
*  Yeah. Yes. And I still am.
*  Worcester is famous for the snow dumps it receives in the winter. It has something to do with where
*  the city is in relation to the Appalachian Mountains. The clouds bear down when the
*  temperature drops, and then the snow is relentless and the weather is brutal.
*  All winter, it's brutal, brutal, brutal. And then somehow, slowly, it's not anymore.
*  That's kind of how the end of WPI's crisis arrived. No one I spoke to could quite explain
*  how they knew that the emergency had subsided. The most they could be sure of was that one moment
*  in the spring of 2022, they felt intuitively that the last death was behind them.
*  Between summer 2021 and winter 2022, the faculty existed in a state of suspension.
*  We were always waiting, waiting for the next, if there was going to be a next,
*  Flu said, like waiting for the other shoe to drop. But then somewhere deep into the winter,
*  she said, it just became apparent that it was over. There was no clear point of demarcation,
*  just a subtle shift. The campus culture felt so much lighter, she said, like we had been
*  through this traumatic experience, but we could somehow see the point at the end of the tunnel.
*  Something was somehow over. King said she knew it had ended, when sometime during the spring,
*  people began looking at one another square in the face again. For months, it seemed as though
*  no one could bear eye contact. In that pain, you usually don't want to. If I look you in the eye,
*  I could feel your pain. And then one day, something had changed. People started looking me in the eye,
*  and I knew they were smiling, although I couldn't see the smile, she said, gesturing to indicate the
*  masks everyone wore at the time. And I knew we were turning the corner. People were looking at
*  me in the eye, like just looking at me. And I was looking at them. It is clear by now that the mental
*  health crisis has changed academia forever. Its structures, its culture, and the function it is
*  expected to perform in American society. More than half of American college students now report
*  depression, anxiety, or seriously considering suicide. This is a problem that reaches across
*  geography, race, class, identity, institutional resources, or prestige in academic ability.
*  Almost one in four Americans in college considered dropping out in the last year because of their
*  mental health. Adjusting pedagogy to account for this scale of illness, and in some cases,
*  disability is the new frontier of post-secondary education. In early 2022, WPI opened a large new
*  Center for Well-being right next to the school's main cafeteria, as if to declare that wellness is
*  central to the school's institutional mission. By the time I visited Worcester this fall,
*  nearly all the short-term recommendations made by the task force and several from Riverside's
*  independent review had been implemented. Morse told me that mental health care should be a
*  campus-wide effort, requiring the participation of every single member of the community.
*  He cited an ongoing program WPI calls the Care Team, which is responsible for coordinating an
*  immediate response when a student is flagged as at-risk. Anyone in the community can register
*  concern about a student with the Care Team, and that same day, the team will have quietly
*  reached out to that student's contacts, dean, professors, and the counseling center to see
*  about approaching that student with support. Morse told me that he recently heard from a janitor in
*  a dining hall who had come to one of the training sessions to learn how to identify students in
*  trouble, figuring that he should know. To Morse, this was a perfect example of the new paradigm.
*  Like many universities, WPI's focus has evolved from taking responsibility solely for the
*  academic education of its students to becoming the custodian of individual student wellness.
*  This is, perhaps, the new vanguard, the academic institution as wellness community.
*  It has a slight dystopian ring to it, the all-encompassing beneficent administrative
*  machine, with eyes everywhere. And yet, the circumstances producing these conditions
*  seem to justify it. Many students who struggle with their mental health or suicidal feelings
*  never reach out to a counselor. The school's goal is to reach struggling students however it can,
*  during classes, on scheduled rest days, through the entire community, including the janitors.
*  WPI is collaborating with the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School on a research
*  project that uses an AI mobile app designed to monitor and predict suicide risk among college
*  students who opt into the study by passively surveilling data and vocal tone. Morse believes
*  in communicating openly about the imperfect and difficult search for best practices.
*  In the aftermath of the crisis, senior leadership heard from some colleagues at other universities
*  who were incredulous at WPI's decision to be so open about what was happening.
*  Some schools keep their suicides out of the public eye, sometimes to honor family privacy,
*  but also to avoid having the institution's name sullied.
*  We made the choice to talk about it, to be as honest and brave as we could,
*  Morse told me, in part because WPI officials believed that sharing their experiences,
*  their process, and their data could help other schools navigating similar territory.
*  But also, Morse said, talking about that work, that's what this campus community needed as part
*  of the healing. This is what happened. This is what we're doing. This is what's working.
*  This is where we're going. With transparency. He pointed out that the Center for Well-being
*  now features prominently in the school's admissions tours.
*  The campus felt, on the sunny days I visited in the fall, energetic and cheerful. Undergrads
*  threw frisbees on the lawn outside the Center for Well-being, and a weekly farmers market
*  sold fruit and flowers nearby. On one of the college sidewalks, students browsed through
*  tables of posters they could buy for their dorm rooms, the same ones that have hung in
*  dorm rooms for decades. The Beatles at Abbey Road. Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night.
*  Marilyn Monroe with her skirts swirling about her shoulders.
*  A bronze goat statue supervised the quad. WPI's mascot is Gompi the Goat. And someone told me
*  that when students matriculate, they are welcomed as part of the herd.
*  One morning, I attended a session of Catherine Fou's course on Smart and Sustainable Cities,
*  which began with a technique she has been using for the last year.
*  She sounded a singing bowl three times and asked everyone to take three deep breaths each time.
*  As the reverberations from the bowl slowly fell silent, Fou went alphabetically by last name down
*  the roster, asking each student to tell the group his or her name and to add a word describing how
*  they felt. One by one, the students responded.
*  I'm feeling relaxed. I'm feeling stressed. I'm feeling hydrated. I still don't know what I'm
*  feeling. Soft laughter rocked around the room for the student and his inscrutable feelings.
*  I was reminded of something King said to me earlier in the day about collectivity being
*  key to both individual and community resilience. I had asked her what the future of this issue was.
*  What was the way to move forward in the face of the massive challenges,
*  pedagogical, structural, personal, facing educators and students alike?
*  I expected her maybe to say something about neurobiology and forward thinking,
*  or about institutional policy. Instead, she said this.
*  I think all of us have to be able to say to each other, and even to the people who are suffering,
*  this is difficult. This is difficult for me. I feel you. I'll try to help but know that I may
*  not be perfect. We all have to take that up. That we're trying. That we're trying. That's all we can say.
*  She thought for a few seconds quietly, and then spoke again. I think that's what community is.
*  Coming together and saying, I'm vulnerable, just like you are. I'm trying. I'm not going to leave
*  you alone. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 to reach the 988 suicide and
