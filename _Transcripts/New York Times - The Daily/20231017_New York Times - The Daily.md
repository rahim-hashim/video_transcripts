# The Arm-Twisting, Back-Stabbing Battle for House Speaker
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi3NTIWO3jk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  The House of Representatives still has no speaker, crippling a vital branch of the government.
*  And it now appears that the Republican in the strongest position to win the job, perhaps
*  as soon as today, is best known for trying to obstruct the government.
*  I spoke with my colleague, Katie Edmondson, about the latest turn in the saga of the leaderless
*  house.
*  It's Tuesday, October 17th.
*  So Katie, the last time that The Daily checked in on the soap opera, that is the Republican-led
*  United States House of Representatives, Speaker Kevin McCarthy had just been ousted from
*  the job.
*  This was on October 4th.
*  And so this entire chamber of Congress was without a leader for the first time in American
*  history.
*  And a few days after that, I spoke with one of the Republicans who helped oust McCarthy,
*  Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee.
*  And he confidently predicted in our conversation that a new speaker would be chosen in just
*  a few days.
*  And it turned out that he was wrong, because we're now in our third straight week without
*  a House speaker.
*  That's right.
*  I mean, the operative word that we've been using all the time, the word that members
*  themselves have been using to describe this period is chaos.
*  And it's never a good time for chaos to reign in the House of Representatives.
*  This is a particularly bad time.
*  You have two ongoing wars right now.
*  You have the war in Ukraine.
*  You have the conflict in Israel and Gaza.
*  And typically our allies would be looking to the United States to send more military
*  aid to help them.
*  But without a speaker, the House can't really move forward on any legislation.
*  So as of now, there's really not an easy path for the US to send any more aid to our allies.
*  And if you look a little further down the line, there is a deadline looming over all
*  of us in the middle of November for the government to shut down unless Congress passes spending
*  bills to keep it open.
*  And it is really hard to imagine the House negotiating its side of the deal, essentially,
*  when there's no speaker.
*  When there's no one to negotiate the deal.
*  Exactly.
*  And so this is a really important stretch for Congress.
*  And it's a really bad time, frankly, not to have a speaker in place.
*  So, Katie, why hasn't this all gone the way that Representative Burchett, and I presume
*  many of the people who ousted McCarthy, all thought that it would?
*  Which is to say, why hasn't there been a quick move to elect a new speaker?
*  Well, let's go back a couple of weeks to right after Kevin McCarthy was ousted.
*  We saw two conservatives who threw their names in the ring to succeed him.
*  Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise of Louisiana.
*  Good to be with y'all.
*  Mr. Scalise was Mr. McCarthy's deputy.
*  He was the number two House Republican.
*  And he's been in Republican leadership in the House for almost a decade now.
*  Look, we want to solve problems.
*  Our members have some of the best ideas.
*  We want to get good conservative policy brought to the floor.
*  He started his tenure in D.C. leading the Republican Study Committee, which is a conservative,
*  policy-oriented faction of House Republicans.
*  And there are really good ideas that are bipartisan ideas that can get that economy moving again.
*  And being in leadership for 10 years, this is someone who has been deeply enmeshed in
*  the governance of the institution.
*  Somebody invested in making the place work rather than this brand of House Republican
*  we've all become very familiar with since the Donald Trump era, who is willing to push
*  the government off a fiscal cliff, shut it down, block almost any spending bill.
*  Scalise feels like a bit more of a throwback to an earlier kind of more pragmatic Republican.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  I don't think anyone would dispute that he is a conservative lawmaker, but it is not
*  in the type of sort of populist fighter model that has become so popular on Capitol Hill
*  that Jim Jordan really embodies.
*  Well tell us more about the story of Jim Jordan, this second candidate who threw his hat into
*  the ring for Speaker.
*  I always tell folks, don't clap, you haven't heard me say anything yet.
*  Yeah, Jim Jordan of Ohio was one of the original co-founders of the House Freedom Caucus.
*  And that was a group of lawmakers that really came to prominence during the Tea Party era.
*  Here's the pattern.
*  The government comes to the taxpayers and says we need more of your money, we need a
*  boatload of your money, the world's going to end.
*  Who define themselves as really willing to go to extremes essentially to try to get what
*  they wanted, which was to disrupt the status quo in Washington.
*  You can't keep raising the limit on a credit card if you're not going to address the problem
*  long term.
*  I understand that.
*  And they showed that they were willing to take in some cases the government hostage,
*  such as forcing government shutdowns.
*  What I'm saying is we are prepared to do what needs to be done to address the underlying
*  problems in this country.
*  Jordan himself really helped orchestrate a government shutdown in 2013 during the Obama
*  presidency.
*  And that was one of many factors that led the Republican Speaker of the House, John
*  Boehner, to call him a legislative terrorist.
*  And then I think more recently, people probably know him as a huge Trump supporter, someone
*  who defended Trump during his impeachment inquiries.
*  Think about it.
*  The same people who are who told us you could trust the Steele dossier are now telling us
*  you can trust the results of this election.
*  The same people.
*  Someone who stood by President Trump when he falsely claimed that he won the 2020 elections
*  and was one of the House Republicans who actually led the effort to try to overturn the election
*  results on that vote on the House floor on January 6th.
*  Something doesn't feel right here.
*  Our president got nine million more votes this time than he did four years ago.
*  And yet he comes up short, even though we gained seats in the House of Representatives.
*  Something doesn't feel right.
*  And now, of course, he's leading the charge or helping to lead the charge to impeach President
*  Biden.
*  So unlike Representative Scalise, who is already in House Republican leadership and is seen
*  as a team player and a policy oriented conservative, Jordan is more of a renegade, more of an insurgent.
*  The idea of him leading the House for many, I'm guessing, would seem a little bit more
*  like a stretch than perhaps Scalise.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  I don't think the arc from legislative terrorist to speaker is a well-worn path.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But, you know, Republicans have this closed door meeting in the middle of last week to
*  decide their party's nominee for speaker.
*  And as you might expect, Scalise emerges with the most support, but it's not an overwhelming
*  victory.
*  He wins 113 votes to Jordan's 99.
*  Right.
*  Not exactly a landslide by 14 votes.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And you see sort of the breakdown in those votes that you might expect.
*  Now, it was a secret vote, but we know from what lawmakers told us that in general, a
*  lot of the more mainstream conservatives backed Scalise and the Freedom Caucus, the
*  hard right lawmakers are backing Jordan.
*  So normally at that juncture in time, lawmakers, regardless of whether they voted for Scalise
*  or not, would pretty much fall in line behind him because...
*  He's the nominee?
*  He's the nominee.
*  Exactly.
*  They'd swallow their pride and vote for him pretty much unanimously.
*  But instead, after he wins the nomination, we almost start to see immediately his support
*  erode.
*  Why?
*  Well, first, it doesn't help that Jordan didn't endorse him.
*  Normally after that kind of vote, you would expect to see the person who lost say, all
*  right, you know, it's time for the conference to unify.
*  Let's all vote for Steve.
*  And Jordan did not do that.
*  He did not do it inside the conference room.
*  He notably declined to do so to reporters, even though we asked him several times.
*  And so this all starts to sort of pile up.
*  You see lawmakers who said that they voted for Scalise start to voice some misgivings.
*  You see some hard right lawmakers start to negotiate really in the press with Scalise
*  saying that there are certain pet issues that they want a commitment from him that he'll
*  adopt.
*  It's not an easy task.
*  You got to listen to people.
*  And in what might be the cruelest of all, Kevin McCarthy finds a TV camera and says
*  time is of the essence.
*  There's not that much time left.
*  Boy, you know, Steve really is having a tough time.
*  Do you think it's possible that he can get the votes?
*  Possible.
*  It's a big hill, though.
*  He told a lot of people he's going to be at 150 and he wasn't there.
*  He's got an uphill battle here and I don't know if he'll have the votes.
*  And what do you make of that?
*  Because he had been Scalise's partner in governing the whole house.
*  Well, that's right.
*  But I mean, I think historically there has been a lot of animosity or there often is
*  a lot of animosity between the number one and number two in the house.
*  And that certainly was true for McCarthy and Scalise.
*  There's a history of bad blood there.
*  And so that was really him publicly twisting the knife.
*  So instead of Scalise finding that people are rallying around him, everyone is shivving
*  him and demanding some special dispensation.
*  And this is not going very well at all.
*  That's right.
*  So Scalise is trying to turn the tide here, essentially.
*  He's on the phone calling lawmakers.
*  He's meeting with them one on one in the leadership suite.
*  He's having some of the holdouts come meet with him and his allies in groups, just trying
*  to find a way essentially to break this impasse.
*  But it's just not working.
*  And he continues to keep just hemorrhaging votes.
*  So by the end of last week, he does the math.
*  First, let me I know we've been following this.
*  It's been quite a journey.
*  He realizes that he does not have the votes to become speaker.
*  I just share with my colleagues that I'm withdrawing my name as a candidate for the speaker designee.
*  And he announces that he is withdrawing from running for speaker.
*  This country is counting on us to come back together.
*  And there's still schisms that have to get resolved.
*  Are you endorsing Jim Jordan?
*  Which of course leaves one candidate for the speakership standing, Jim Jordan, who, as
*  we've said, doesn't exactly seem too many like leadership material, but he's the only candidate.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Now it becomes Jim Jordan's race to win or lose.
*  And there were a lot of questions as to whether the more mainstream Republicans, whether moderate
*  Republicans in tough swing seats who are up for tough reelection battles next year, would
*  be willing to fall in line behind him.
*  I heard from some lawmakers saying, you know, I really want to be done with this.
*  I want to elect a speaker, but I really don't want to reward this hard right minority that
*  has essentially taken us all hostage.
*  So that's where things stood at the end of last week.
*  And at that point, House Republican leadership told their lawmakers it was fine for them
*  to go home for the weekend back to their districts.
*  And that was when Jim Jordan unleashed this really remarkable lobbying campaign, the likes
*  of which we've never really seen before for this job against these hold-ups that was so
*  intense and to many people off-putting, honestly, that the question became, is this campaign
*  going to work and going to deliver him the speakership, or is it going to alienate so
*  many lawmakers that they simply refuse to give him the job?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Katie, tell us more about this intense, unusual lobbying campaign that Jim Jordan
*  embarks on to try to win over House Republicans who aren't ready to support him as speaker.
*  So remember, in that initial vote, Jordan got fewer votes than Scalise.
*  So we know right off the bat that there are many members, in fact, nearly half the conference,
*  who didn't immediately support him.
*  So they hold another vote and a bunch of lawmakers swing over to his side out of wanting to
*  wrap this whole spectacle up.
*  But at the end of the day, around 50 of them vote against Jordan, essentially saying, there's
*  no way we're supporting you.
*  Which is a lot of Republicans to stand in your way if you're trying to become speaker.
*  It's a big block of opposition.
*  And so what Jordan's allies begin to do essentially is to browbeat members into supporting him.
*  And how do they try to browbeat them?
*  So the idea here is that Jordan is going to activate the base, hardcore Republican voters,
*  the grassroots.
*  And so a number of Jordan allies, really prominent figures, almost influencer type figures within
*  conservative media, start to post the photos of lawmakers who are refusing to back Jordan.
*  They post their names.
*  And crucially, they post their DC office phone numbers, saying, you know, if you are a true
*  conservative, if you are a patriot, you need to call this lawmaker and demand that they
*  vote for Jim Jordan for speaker or else.
*  Which is typically what you do when you want a piece of legislation to pass.
*  You tell constituents to call their lawmaker and support this bill.
*  Here it's being used to demand that constituents call and tell their congressperson to vote
*  for Jim Jordan as speaker.
*  It's being used as a cudgel.
*  And frankly, given the reach of a lot of these influencers, it's not even asking just the
*  constituents of that lawmakers district.
*  The message is really any concerned citizen needs to flood these lawmakers' phone lines
*  and give them a piece of your mind.
*  And that's what happens.
*  And Michael, I mean, you know this, one of the biggest fears for Republican lawmakers
*  is that they are going to be primaried for being insufficiently conservative.
*  And so what happens is when your name is being plastered across social media as someone who
*  is not supporting who the base wants, that begins to activate those fears that maybe
*  you'll be primaried.
*  You could be run out of Congress for this.
*  So it's a really potent campaign.
*  So you're seeing this deluge of calls, really, to these lawmakers' offices.
*  And then kind of the cherry on top of the sundae is that Sean Hannity gets involved.
*  A member of Congress shares an email with an Axios reporter up on the hill that they
*  received from someone working for the Hannity show, asking for comment about why they're
*  not supporting Jim Jordan.
*  And I think when you look at this email, I think most reporters would agree that the
*  phrasing of the email is not necessarily a just the facts, you know, are you supporting
*  Mr. Jordan up or down?
*  Can you read it?
*  I, hold on, let me find it.
*  So it begins, hello, Stephanie from the Hannity show with Fox News.
*  Sources tell Hannity that Representative so-and-so is not supporting Representative Jim Jordan
*  for speaker.
*  Can you please let me know if this is accurate?
*  And if true, Hannity would like to know why during a war breaking out between Israel and
*  Hamas, with the war in Ukraine, with the wide open borders, with a budget that's unfinished,
*  why would Representative so-and-so be against Representative Jim Jordan for speaker?
*  Please let us know when Representative so-and-so plans on opening the People's House so work
*  can be done.
*  So what Jordan and his allies are clearly wagering here is that with these implicit
*  threats, they can kind of strong arm the majority of those in the House who originally opposed
*  Jordan and bring them around to the minority view that Jim Jordan, this far right, pugilistic,
*  insurgent conservative should be the House speaker.
*  And they're really doing that through a series of threats.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  I mean, the message is if you don't turn around and support me now, we will unleash the base
*  on you.
*  But the thing is, Michael, is that it seems to be working.
*  There were a number of Republicans who we spoke to at the end of last week who were
*  telling us I will never vote for Jim Jordan, count me as a never Jordan, he'll never have
*  my vote, who as of Monday morning were suddenly putting out statements saying, well, I've
*  had time to reconsider and I spoke with Congressman Jordan and actually, you know, I think he'll
*  make a good speaker and we should really be united.
*  And anyway, yes, I'll be supporting him on the floor.
*  So he's already won some really important converts.
*  And with this strategy in mind, he has scheduled a vote on the House floor, Tuesday at noon.
*  And really, the beauty of this strategy in his eyes is that even though the math is coming
*  his way, even though he seems to be feeling pretty good about the support he'll get on the House
*  floor, from his perspective, even if he has a small number of lawmakers continuing to
*  block him from winning that speaker's gavel, it almost doesn't matter because once those
*  constituents see their lawmaker publicly standing up on the House floor and blocking Jim
*  Jordan from becoming speaker, then they're really going to hear it.
*  And by maybe the end of the day, maybe by the next day, they will cave and let him become
*  speaker.
*  Got it. So even if Jim Jordan on Tuesday loses the first few rounds of votes in the same
*  way that Kevin McCarthy did back in January, you're saying that would invite such holy
*  hell on the Republicans who oppose him that they would inevitably consider buckling and
*  voting for Jordan just to get everyone off their back and avoid the political mayhem
*  of opposing him.
*  That is exactly the bet that Jim Jordan is making.
*  So let's say, Katie, that by the end of Tuesday, Jim Jordan is elected speaker of the
*  United States House of Representatives.
*  It will have clearly been through this perhaps creative but ultimately fear based strategy
*  rather than through having genuinely cultivated the affections of his fellow Republicans.
*  So what kind of mandate would that represent for a speaker, Jordan?
*  Yeah, it's a really good question.
*  I mean, it's hard to imagine, honestly, at this point, what the House as a governing
*  institution looks like run by a speaker, Jim Jordan.
*  But in a way, it is kind of a perfect arc for this entire year.
*  You had a small minority of far right Republicans blocking Kevin McCarthy from becoming
*  speaker at the beginning of the year.
*  You have an even smaller group, just eight Republicans toppling him earlier this month.
*  And then you have someone who really is one of them who shares their ideology, who
*  shares their belief in tactical warfare, becoming speaker at the end of the day.
*  Right.
*  That is a fascinating arc.
*  But I wonder what it means if Jordan wins for those far right House Republicans and
*  for the entire institution, because for the longest time, like you just said, those far
*  right House Republicans, the obstructionists, the insurgents, they have been seen by the
*  speaker as the problem children.
*  Right.
*  They're the ones who block everything.
*  They have to be managed, dealt with.
*  If one of them is now running the whole House, does that mean that those far right
*  obstructionists are suddenly much more empowered?
*  They're now kind of running the place?
*  Or does it mean that their power has to be diluted and they have to learn to start
*  negotiating because that's what always happens when the outsider and the insurgent
*  becomes the leader of a place?
*  I mean, if he is elected speaker, that is going to be the central question of his
*  tenure.
*  This is someone who was branded in his early days as a legislative terrorist.
*  This is someone who creates chaos rather than solves it.
*  I mean, if you look at Kevin McCarthy, when faced with the choice of placating the
*  hard right rebels of his conference and ensuring that government could work, he
*  chose every time cutting a deal with Democrats to make sure that the government
*  could work.
*  Right.
*  And it cost him his job.
*  And it cost him his job.
*  I don't know what choice Jim Jordan makes.
*  I don't know that Jim Jordan is willing to cut a deal with Democrats to keep the
*  government open, for example.
*  But what I think is clear is that if Jim Jordan wins the Speaker's gavel today, we
*  are going to see for the first time what it means to have the far right faction of
*  the House Republican Conference not just sitting at the table, but in fact have
*  the final say in some of the biggest decisions made by the United States
*  Congress.
*  At a moment when some very, very big decisions have to be made.
*  Exactly.
*  Katie, thank you very much.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  The Times reports that as of late Monday night, Representative Jordan had won over
*  all but around 10 Republican holdouts and is counting on most of them to cave under
*  pressure today during a series of votes on the House floor.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  President Biden will travel to Israel tomorrow as it prepares to invade Gaza and
*  attempts to destroy Hamas.
*  The trip will serve as an extraordinary wartime demonstration of American
*  solidarity with Israel, one designed to deter Israel's enemies, including Iran and
*  from intervening in the conflict.
*  But it will further link both Biden and the United States to Israel's deadly
*  offensive in Gaza.
*  On Monday, in a sign of just how bloody that military operation may become,
*  Israel's defense minister told the U.S.
*  Secretary of State that the invasion of Gaza would entail a long war that will
*  come at a great cost to human life.
*  And the federal judge overseeing the criminal trial of Donald Trump on charges
*  of trying to overturn the 2020 election has imposed a gag order on the former
*  president.
*  The order, which Trump plans to appeal, restricts him from making public
*  statements attacking the witnesses, prosecutors or court staff involved in
*  the case, something Trump has already done repeatedly.
*  Judge Tanya Chutkin said that Trump can still publicly argue that the case is
*  politically motivated and even attack her, but that he cannot, quote, vilify
*  and implicitly encourage violence against public servants who are simply
*  doing their jobs.
