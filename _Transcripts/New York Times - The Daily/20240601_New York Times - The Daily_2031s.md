# 'The Interview': Richard Linklater Sees the Killer Inside Us All
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9kGMMef0UU)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview, I'm David Marchese.
*  If I ask you to think of a Richard Linklater movie, what do you think of?
*  Maybe it's the cult favorite Days of Confused, that's the movie that launched Matthew McConaughey's
*  career.
*  Or maybe it's Before Sunrise, the first installment of his beloved trilogy about big ideas, love
*  and fate.
*  Or maybe you'd think about the low-key, coming-of-age epic Boyhood, which Linklater famously found
*  in a movie that he filmed over a dozen years.
*  And of course you can't forget School of Rock, his biggest hit, which exists in a category
*  all of its own.
*  And to me that's the fun of Linklater's work.
*  You never quite know what he's going to make next.
*  So I wasn't surprised to see him getting into romantic crime thrillers with his new movie
*  Hitman.
*  It stars the great Glenn Powell, who also co-wrote it.
*  It's excellent.
*  But I would argue that it's excellent because it's actually not so far off from his other
*  work as it might seem.
*  Between all the thrills, the crimes, and the sex, Hitman sneaks in a pretty provocative
*  exploration of one of Linklater's favorite themes, the changing nature of identity.
*  Basically, what it means to be a person.
*  It's also a movie, as so many of Linklater's films are, that understands just how much
*  fun it is to watch smart characters talk to each other, exploring ideas, making each other
*  laugh, and even testing each other a little bit.
*  It's the talking that made me fall in love with Linklater's films, because those are
*  the kinds of conversations that are most meaningful to me.
*  I don't want to make too much of all this, but I can see a pretty clear line from teenage
*  me sitting around watching Waking Life and Slacker over and over again, to me here now
*  talking with those films director, Richard Linklater, who, as it turns out, sounds a
*  lot like a character from one of his movies.
*  Here's our conversation.
*  I think it's fair to say that a lot of your films are asking questions about identity
*  and formation of identity, and given that that's a recurring theme in your work, I'm
*  curious how you think about your identity at 63 years old.
*  Do you feel like it's fixed?
*  Do you feel like you still have formative experiences?
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that the question of self?
*  It's the kind of thing I thought a lot about my entire life.
*  What could transform me?
*  What could make me feel different than how I feel, how I see the world?
*  So I've always kind of monitored that.
*  Like, what's going to change me?
*  I was probably more in the camp of we're fixed, give or take whatever, a little percentage
*  around the edges, and we sort of accept ourselves.
*  So I was more interested in this notion lately that, oh, you really can change.
*  You know, the personality isn't fixed.
*  But that seems sort of current, you know, in a way.
*  This notion of self and identity, you know, gender, anything.
*  I sort of like that it's all on the table, that everybody's thinking like, well, you
*  kind of are who you say you are, you know?
*  To me, that's interesting.
*  Do you have a lot of different identities?
*  Yeah, probably as many as anybody else.
*  What are the different ones?
*  Well, you know, if you get me on a ping pong table, like an area where like my third rail
*  is athletics, you know, I cross into this realm where I was acculturated and just good
*  enough to like figure I should be good and achieve and I have this bar for myself.
*  So I feel this little rush of competitiveness, which I really don't have in the world of
*  art at all, or my life even.
*  I don't see it anywhere.
*  But it's in certain areas, and I try to avoid them because it's not the best me.
*  But every now and then, it can be fun to kind of push yourself.
*  But you know, I'm the guy looking at the world through glass, you know, I was always the
*  guy in the corner thinking about everything.
*  I'm not an extrovert.
*  I'm an introvert who gets put in extroverted situations occasionally, and I could play
*  that role.
*  But roles I currently play?
*  I don't know.
*  It's nice to care less about it as you get older.
*  About what?
*  Like consistency, maybe.
*  But my pure self is on the set.
*  I'm making a movie.
*  I'm pretty convinced.
*  The self that I've worked for and the pinnacle of my time and effort, I realize, is rehearsing
*  and shooting the movie and whatever writing before.
*  That's the pure me, but it's manufactured me.
*  Catch me at dinner later and you get the same guy who's processing the shit of the day and
*  having his lectures about what I know and whatever lunatic political ideas that are
*  flowing through my system in real time like everybody else.
*  But I process the world through art and in particular cinema, and that's the space that
*  I've been lucky enough to live in.
*  What's a lunatic political idea that's in your system right now?
*  Oh, you're really going to...
*  Well, you notice.
*  I don't really...
*  If you're unfortunate enough to be sitting next to me at dinner or around me, I often
*  just spout off.
*  But I don't have a need to share that publicly so much because I know it's not a long-term
*  thought.
*  I guess the meticulous long-term nature of making a film is a certain kind of personality.
*  And someone who has to be on Twitter or whatever spouting off their moment to moment taking
*  in and spitting out of the world, I have those ideas, but I know they have no value.
*  I know I'm not going to enlighten anyone, but I really do draw a line.
*  I'm like, yeah, I could mouth off, I could share my brain snot with the whole world the
*  way everybody else did, but I don't see any value in it for me personally because I've
*  been privileged, gifted, whatever you want to say, to make the greatest, most expressive
*  storytelling art form ever invented.
*  So I'm one of the few who get to do that.
*  So why would I put any effort into these transitory, weird little reactive areas?
*  I think you should file away brain snot as a possible fictional band name in a film,
*  the name of a punk EP, maybe a seven-inch brain snot.
*  That's pretty good.
*  Well, that's what so much of the world feels like, doesn't it?
*  Brain snot?
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a primitive, like conspiracy.
*  It's activated brains, but just unfiltered, unaccredited, what was kind of fun a long
*  time ago.
*  Oh, let's just say conspiracy or alternative thinking and all that, just to see it metastasize
*  into something so lethal and harmful.
*  So it's kind of like, wow, I don't want to participate in that at all.
*  I want to ask you a question that connects a little bit more to Glenn Powell and Hitman.
*  In the film, Glenn Powell plays a half dozen or so different Hitmen.
*  His character is assuming these different roles within the film.
*  And it's really sort of, I hate to use a corny term, but kind of like a star-making performance.
*  And I think he's someone who people have a sense that this guy's a big star in the making.
*  And you've done movies with a bunch of big stars.
*  You did, obviously, Matthew McConaughey's in The Newton Boys and Dazed and Confused
*  in Bernie.
*  Keanu Reeves in A Scanner Darkly, Ben Affleck.
*  I mean, the list goes on.
*  Shirley MacLaine, Jack Black, both in Bernie.
*  And I always wondered, do you feel like as a director, you understand what makes someone
*  a star?
*  Every actor I work with is like, oh, this is a star to me.
*  I love him.
*  I think my camera loves him.
*  I love the character.
*  So it's always been a mystery to me what happens with people's futures.
*  You just don't know.
*  I think there's luck.
*  There's a lot of elements involved that no one person's in control of.
*  I don't think anyone's ever surprised me.
*  I'm not surprised when Matthew becomes a star or Ben Affleck.
*  You look back and it all makes sense.
*  It's like, yeah, of course, they were great.
*  They had this thing.
*  I'm probably more surprised others didn't get that opportunity or aren't seen as that.
*  Hollywood doesn't know what to do with, but there's kind of an eternal mystery of opportunities
*  and cultural moments that you get.
*  So I think Glenn's having one of those right now, perhaps, it seems.
*  But I think anyone who knows Glenn, who's worked with him in the last 10 years, would
*  say, oh, that could have come 10 years ago.
*  Glenn is Glenn.
*  He's got that star quality.
*  I've known that for a long time.
*  Do you think actors can see in themselves the qualities that you as the director can
*  see?
*  I'm thinking of an example that a few years ago, I interviewed Brad Pitt around the time
*  of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.
*  I was asking him about this one specific scene where he just sort of turns towards the camera
*  a little and he's got this smile.
*  It's just a perfect example of how star quality can make a scene.
*  And I was asking about it, and it was clear he had no idea, like he didn't really remember
*  the scene, had no idea what I was talking about.
*  And then, of course, after the interview was over, I realized, oh, that was actually a
*  question for Quentin Tarantino.
*  He understood something in that actor in that moment.
*  It's not about whether the actor knows him.
*  But do you think you see things in these personalities that they aren't aware of or don't?
*  It's not the kind of thing you talk about consciously.
*  There's nothing to be gained for telling the actor, well, you're such a star in this, you
*  can just turn and look that.
*  You just say, hey, look over here and look that way.
*  You know what you're dealing with.
*  You know they're a star.
*  And cinema rides on this kind of star charisma.
*  Brad Pitt knows he's a fucking star that's been drilled into his head every day for the
*  last 30 years.
*  But maybe how it's used and whatever.
*  I read, I think it was the New Yorker profile of you, probably around the time of boyhood.
*  And in there, it said that there was some point in your life as a young man where you
*  were watching something like 600 movies a year.
*  You would go to a theater and watch three or four movies in a row.
*  And I think a lot of us can relate to that feeling, especially in early adulthood or
*  late adolescence, of really falling in love with an art form.
*  We almost get kind of drunk on it.
*  And I'm curious what the feeling you get from movies now is and how it's different from
*  what it used to be.
*  Yeah, I don't think you can ever replace that initial just passion and fury when you've
*  discovered your art form and you just take it in with your entire being.
*  I'd write down every movie I saw, 650 films a year.
*  I mean, that was really nothing.
*  And a lot of it, looking back, it's like, oh, that's what you had to do.
*  Kind of you're transitioning from the real world to your world and your world.
*  In my case, it was just cinema.
*  The arts are this other world you want to live in, not the world you live in.
*  But it's different now.
*  I don't have the need to see that many movies.
*  I still love movies and still life dedicated to it.
*  You feed yourself in different ways.
*  Do you still get the electricity or the jolt from seeing a film that you used to?
*  What's a recent movie that kind of blew the top of your head off?
*  Yeah, that's a good question.
*  No, I can't get the same jolt.
*  I just, you can't get the same jolt.
*  I can get a jolt, but it's a different kind of jolt.
*  I know too much.
*  I'm behind the camera.
*  I know what they're doing.
*  But I can still, I judge films on like, oh, what got my cinematic blood circulating?
*  What really kind of got me like, oh, that was cinema.
*  So maybe I kind of put zone of interest in that category.
*  I was looking at that going, oh, boom, that's a movie.
*  I think there's a sense currently that we're sort of in a weird moment for cinema.
*  I've even read interviews with you where you've wondered about whether the current generation
*  of audiences value cinema and whether you came up during kind of like the last, I think
*  the way you put it was the last good era of filmmaking.
*  What makes you wonder those things?
*  Why are those questions in your mind?
*  Well, I don't think I said good era of filmmaking.
*  I would say maybe the culture was different.
*  It's always the last question.
*  You're talking about your new movie.
*  What do you think about the state of cinema today?
*  And it's like, oh, be careful.
*  Because it's, I don't know, we're all prone to these overarching big important statements
*  about the state of things.
*  And if you know anything about the history of cinema, that's all it's ever been.
*  It's always been the end of cinema.
*  Something was wiping it out.
*  Even sound, color, technicolor, you know, cinemascope, TV, it's always been under threat.
*  It's always been very volatile feeling.
*  The industry is always threatened.
*  I think because it's an industry that's prone to technological change.
*  You know, things can come along and just wipe it out or change it pretty significantly.
*  So it's different than painting or literature or other art forms.
*  It's sort of technology and commerce are really nearby, kind of codependent within the art form.
*  So I think everyone's always on alert and everyone's always a little paranoid.
*  That the system that they've known is coming to an end.
*  Well, you're working currently on an adaptation of the Sondheim musical,
*  Merrily We Roll Along, which the musical takes place over the course of 20 or so years.
*  And your plan, sort of like what you did with Boyhood, where you filmed it over a period of
*  years and years, is that you're filming your adaptation of Merrily We Roll Along over 20
*  years or so.
*  At least that's the plan.
*  And so when you finish this movie, I guess with the caveat, if you finish this movie.
*  Yeah, throw that in there, please.
*  You're going to be over 80 years old.
*  I'll be about 80.
*  And so it's going to be kind of a life and career capstone, I would think.
*  So tell me why that project, given how like the place you know it's going to occupy
*  in your life and your career.
*  You want to hear something that's technically insane?
*  And I admit it.
*  Yes.
*  You said capstone to a career at age 80.
*  I've never thought that.
*  Ah.
*  Because I see myself making a film when I'm like 94.
*  I really do.
*  So I think it's like, oh yeah, those years will go along.
*  I'll try to stay in shape, try to be healthy, hope to get lucky.
*  And I just, I mean, I'm not an idiot.
*  I know.
*  But it's all at the behest of we're telling a story that takes place over 20 years.
*  And it's really important for this story to work that you feel those years go by.
*  So it's the same reason that you know, boyhood put its, you know, that was boyhood.
*  You had to feel life going by.
*  And this movie is about long-term, you know, friendship and the way life treats people
*  and how that shifts around over 20 years.
*  But you know, I just think you can, in the arts, you can will things into existence.
*  And if people are passionate about it, you make it happen.
*  You know, everybody involved in that is clearly doing it because they care.
*  So we just have to assume they'll keep caring and they'll care 10 years,
*  15, 17 more years.
*  But you know, you judge people on that.
*  You go, oh, before I cast them, I'm going to go, you're a lifer.
*  You know, you're going to be doing this.
*  I did that on boyhood.
*  I asked Patricia Arquette, like, what are you going to be doing 12 years from now?
*  And she's like, I'm going to be probably looking for a part.
*  I said, yeah, and I'm going to be trying to make a film.
*  So let's just start now and we'll be who we are now and in the future.
*  And that's all it was.
*  It's not some huge leap of faith.
*  Yeah.
*  It's blowing my mind that you could say this movie that I'm going to spend 20 years making
*  that I'm going to finish when I'm 83.
*  I'll be 80.
*  Don't add any more.
*  I mean, they're going to be.
*  But that's solely because that's sort of what you think the film itself is demanding and not
*  because it's like a meaningful overarching statement of some sort.
*  If anybody spent 20 years working on something, you'd say, well, that says something about who
*  they are and what's important to them.
*  Telling a well-told story the right way is what means the most to me.
*  Finding the form that meets the content.
*  That's what a director does.
*  You feel not just a story, but how to tell it, what it should look and feel like.
*  I don't know.
*  I like long.
*  So many art forms are fairly quick.
*  I think cinema has the ability to be.
*  I love that it's at the Whitney, that J. de Feo painting, the Rose.
*  Have you ever seen it?
*  It's huge, right?
*  It's huge.
*  It's thick.
*  It's like a foot thick because she spent so many years painting layers of paint on it.
*  I just love it.
*  I find it so moving just knowing the effort.
*  First, it's a stunning work, but how did it get so thick and just, you know, whatever.
*  I mean, most artists, we have found the right therapy for our conditions or whatever neurological
*  whatever neurological conditions we're dealing with.
*  But, you know, we're just, everyone's just wired a little different.
*  So I admit that about myself and just go with it.
*  It's like, okay, well, it's the way my brain works.
*  Do you have some sort of contingency plan?
*  If I don't know, if your vision starts to go 10 years from now, what happens to the film?
*  Oh, good thought.
*  Well, if I had everything else in the vision went, I would probably get
*  I don't know.
*  That's a good question.
*  I can make you a list.
*  I would, I don't know.
*  I would adapt somehow.
*  Yeah.
*  Just turn the whole thing over to someone.
*  I don't know.
*  Not that I'll deal with that when it happens.
*  It's funny.
*  Funny to think that way.
*  But I mean, what's the alternative?
*  Most people live their life like there's no tomorrow.
*  But I'm kind of the opposite.
*  I think of death regularly and I kind of see life as very fleeting and, you know,
*  we're all grateful to be here every, you know, I, but then I have this other side that just
*  expect to play it out, I guess.
*  You think of death regularly?
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Not in a bad way.
*  Just, you know, I just see life as kind of fleeting.
*  Is that bad?
*  It sounds like a question that could be posed by a character in one of your films.
*  Well, it comes from somewhere.
*  I mean, you know, it's kind of poetic to know I'm not going to be here forever.
*  No one is.
*  You know, I walked through graveyards and I read a bit, but I'm not morbid about it.
*  I just kind of acknowledge life passing and all of us being here for a little while.
*  And it's kind of beautiful that we're all here crossing paths at the same moment.
*  I saw that as a kid.
*  Saw what as a kid?
*  Just I knew it from the earliest of ages.
*  I liked astronomy and I liked
*  science and just knowing how old everything was and how brief humans and life spans and like,
*  oh, we really are insignificant.
*  So that scares some people, but I love that feeling.
*  I love that feeling of just how random and small we are in the universe.
*  I may be going to put this question in slightly pretentious terms, but I think given that I'm
*  talking to Richard Link later and certainly there are conversations in your films that
*  some other people might say are slightly pretentious, I'm going to give myself permission
*  to do it.
*  Yeah, I'm fine with that.
*  But I was just reading about this poet Delmore Schwartz and he has this poem called
*  Suraz, like the painter George Suraz, Suraz Sunday Afternoon.
*  And it's all about the artist is someone who observes life, but doesn't fully participate in it.
*  So I read that and I was then thinking about you and your films because I think of your films
*  as really having all these sort of very closely and intimately observed moments of what on the
*  surface just seemed like normal life.
*  You know, it could be two people walking and talking, you know, or just throughout boyhood.
*  There's countless scenes of just normal life.
*  That's all it is.
*  And then I thought, well, what does your interest in that have to do with or how does it affect
*  your sense of observation of your real life when it's happening?
*  Like, are you always sort of sitting back and observing life kind of from a distance?
*  Always.
*  Yeah, that's the curse.
*  I'm in the moment.
*  I'm out of the moment.
*  It kind of robs you of the in the moment experience.
*  But then there's also kind of a mentality, I think, not uncommon to writers and film people
*  is like, this will only be real when I process it through my art form.
*  Like something terrible is happening right in front of you.
*  You know, your loved ones dying or relationships ending and you're like,
*  oh, you're just processing it not in the moment, but like, I'm going to have a character in a movie
*  someday experience this and I'm going to try to capture this.
*  What I just felt very, very deeply.
*  But you're robbing yourself and the person you're with or whatever of that moment,
*  but maybe it's a self preservation way of just taking something and storing it away
*  or processing it through.
*  So I share that, you know, like, nothing's really real until I make it work in a movie
*  in some way.
*  Maybe we'll get into it when we talk again, but I really have questions about the last
*  15 minutes of Hit Pan.
*  But for this time, thank you very much for taking all the time and I'll talk to you in a few days.
*  Okay, yeah, we'll continue.
*  After the break, more reflections from Richard Linklater on art, life,
*  and why mellowing out isn't something to be afraid of.
*  I've had this conversation over the years with filmmaker friends.
*  Am I as passionate as I was in my 20s?
*  Would I risk my whole life if it was my best friend or my best friend?
*  If it was my best friend or my negative drowning, which do I save?
*  The 20 something self goes, I'm saving my film.
*  Hello?
*  Richard, how are you?
*  Oh, hey.
*  Hey.
*  You know, there was something that I realized was totally on the tip of my tongue the whole time
*  we spoke.
*  And I just didn't know if it was okay to bring up.
*  And that was the ending of Hitman, which I found kind of threw me for a loop.
*  And I think there's probably a way to talk about it without giving too much away.
*  Oh, I'm not a spoiler person.
*  I don't care.
*  You know, most people forget by the time they get there.
*  I don't believe things anyway.
*  So I don't mind spoilers.
*  All right.
*  Well, so Glenn Powell's character, Gary, commits a morally problematic act, to say the least.
*  And one of the ideas of the film is that sort of we, and this is something we talked about earlier,
*  is that we all have the power to create our own identity.
*  And the film then suggests that that includes the identity of someone capable of murder
*  and then living seemingly happily after having committed murder.
*  That's pretty dark.
*  Yes, but I don't know.
*  I think most people kind of think they could probably handle that.
*  The people who have flirted with this.
*  I mean, everybody wants someone dead, probably.
*  I asked this around.
*  It's like, could you murder someone?
*  I said, I've been in the film business over 30 years.
*  Of course I could murder somebody.
*  Who do you want dead?
*  No, I don't want anyone dead.
*  I don't want anyone.
*  Neither do I.
*  I spread that out.
*  I don't want anything dead.
*  But I think there's a surprising number of people in the world who,
*  to whatever degree, voluntary or involuntary, who have done something that's ended a life.
*  Can compartmentalize it away.
*  I don't know if you saw my documentary.
*  I was going to say what you're talking about now directly reminds me of the doc you did for
*  God Save Texas, the HBO series.
*  Do you want to tell people what that documentary was about if they haven't seen it yet?
*  Well, it's an exploration of my hometown and the world I sort of grew up in and around.
*  It does kind of take on the death penalty,
*  mainly from the people who are involved in the killing machine of it,
*  the state sanctioned murder part of it.
*  You grew up in Huntsville, Texas, which is the town where Texas carries out its state executions.
*  That's where the prison system is based and they do the executions there.
*  But the questions posed by your documentary about how people basically find a way to coexist
*  with what's really a moral abomination, which is the death penalty and the state
*  sanctioned killing of other people.
*  Also reminded me of how you mentioned Jonathan Glazer's Zone of Interest was a film that
*  you'd sort of admired that came out recently, which in sort of an even more extreme way,
*  asks similar questions about how people go about their lives right beside something
*  awful happening.
*  I wonder, do you feel like you have an understanding of how people are able to
*  compartmentalize in that way?
*  Did you learn anything about people from making your documentary?
*  I've always been fascinated by that, how we can compartmentalize.
*  If you spread around the horror of abomination, just think of the way we treat animals.
*  If you eat meat, you are supporting a really super cruel, horrible system that creates incredible
*  pain and suffering.
*  You've been a vegetarian for a long time, right?
*  Yeah, but I'm just saying the human psyche has no problem, or what is done by your government
*  in the name of this or that.
*  You can't make it through the modern world without pushing out the horror show that is
*  a lot of life, right?
*  So you pick your spots and what you can participate in affect change.
*  But we're all doing this little psychic dance to let ourselves think we're not horrible
*  people.
*  And I have this whole, we're suing the state of Texas right now.
*  I have this political-
*  Wait, I didn't know that.
*  What are you suing Texas for?
*  For heat conditions in prison.
*  My friend, Bernie Tita, we just-
*  Oh, the real life inspiration for your movie, Bernie.
*  Yeah, he's the lead plaintiff in the seat.
*  We're going to hopefully change.
*  They have just an unbelievably cruel system where they don't have to air condition
*  state prison cells.
*  They do federal, they do local jails, they do for animal facilities, but somehow you
*  don't have to for state.
*  And it's just horror.
*  I mentioned it in my documentary, the heat conditions, not only for corrections officers,
*  but for the inmates.
*  So there's this big lawsuit that we really think will change a lot of people's lives.
*  So I don't know.
*  You go into political realms and that's a whole other, you could dedicate your entire life to
*  trying to make the world a better place.
*  But I picked my spots.
*  Can I bring up something?
*  It was only after the thing for the next hours I processed and just all the thoughts I did not
*  articulate very well, which is everything.
*  Most of what I say.
*  When you were asking if I felt it is a point important question, I think I just don't think
*  I raised to the question.
*  It was what's your relation now to the work back then?
*  Are you as passionate?
*  Are you still seeing 600 moves a year?
*  How different?
*  And I really had to think about that.
*  And my analysis of that is you're a different person with different needs.
*  And a lot of that is based on just confidence.
*  When you're starting out in an art form or anything in life, you can't have confidence
*  because you don't have experience.
*  But you have to be pretty confident to say make a film.
*  So the only way you counterbalance that lack of experience and confidence is just absolute
*  passion, full on dedication, kind of fanatical spirit.
*  And I've had this conversation over the years with filmmaker friends.
*  Am I as passionate as I was in my 20s?
*  Would I risk my whole life if it was my best friend or my negative drowning?
*  Which do I save?
*  The 20 something self goes, I'm saving my film.
*  Good luck, fucker.
*  And now it's not that answer.
*  And I'm not ashamed to say that because all that passion doesn't just go away.
*  It disperses a little healthfully.
*  I'm much more passionate in this world about a lot of things.
*  The most fascinating relation we all have is obviously to ourselves at different times
*  in our lives.
*  And you look back and it's like, God, I'm not as passionate as I was at 25.
*  Thank God that was a crazy fuck, that person.
*  Very insecure, very, you know, you're better than that now.
*  And your chiller may be a better person, less selfish.
*  And you look back at it as kind of heroic or something necessary.
*  And it is, it absolutely is, it makes total sense.
*  But I don't think you can do that forever if that's the only way you can work.
*  You're not in it maybe for the long haul.
*  Well, you know, probably 23 or however many years ago, I was just laying on the floor
*  high out of my mind watching Waking Life thinking, how can I get inside that movie?
*  I'm much happier to be talking to you today than to be laying stone on my floor watching
*  Waking Life.
*  And I still love Waking Life.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  Thank you very much for taking the time to talk with me.
*  I appreciate it.
*  I really have gotten a lot out of your movies over the years.
*  So thank you for that too.
*  Really nice talking to you too.
*  We'll do it again, I'm sure sometime.
*  And have the first Merrily interview 17 years from now.
*  All right, let's do it.
