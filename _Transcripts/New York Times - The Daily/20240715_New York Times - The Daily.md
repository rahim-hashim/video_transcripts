# The Attempted Assassination of Donald Trump
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IJppwYy2rI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernese.
*  And this is The Daily.
*  The nation is waking up to a new reality after former President Donald Trump was injured
*  in an apparent assassination attempt.
*  Gunshots ripping through a Pennsylvania campaign rally and carving their way into the history
*  books.
*  I heard pop pop.
*  I think a lot of people in the crowd just thought it was fireworks going off.
*  I knew immediately it was gunshots.
*  And everybody screaming drop and you can see the blood like splatter on his face and the
*  Secret Service just barricades him.
*  And you know, it's just like so scary.
*  Today, senior law enforcement officials say the gunman was a 20 year old man from Pennsylvania.
*  The gunman was on the roof of a building several hundred feet from the lectern where Trump
*  was speaking.
*  What we know about the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a rally
*  in Pennsylvania.
*  I just go back to this idea that something has been fundamentally changed.
*  People are desperate for answers to figure out how this could have happened, how to prevent
*  it.
*  My colleague, photographer Doug Mills recounts what it was like to witness the shooting.
*  And reporter Glenn Thrush on the state of the investigation into the man who did it.
*  It's Monday, July 15th.
*  Oh, this is him.
*  I have to reroute through this thing, though.
*  Hold on.
*  Doug.
*  Hey, Sabrina, how are you?
*  How are you?
*  Still a little shaken up, actually.
*  Never thought I'd ever be in a situation like this or be part of a story like this.
*  It's not something I ever dreamed of having happen in my career.
*  And it shakes you up.
*  I mean, it's pretty damn frightening.
*  Doug Mills has been photographing presidents for the Times for the past 40 years.
*  I spoke to him on Saturday night, about four hours after the shooting.
*  What's in your head right now?
*  My first thought is obviously I am thankful that the former president is not more seriously
*  injured than he is.
*  I'm saddened that other people lost their life.
*  I mean, as much as I cover the United States, whether it's former President Trump or President
*  Biden or President Obama, all the way back to Reagan, it seems more and more intense
*  and more and more divided and sadly scarier as the days grow on.
*  And just having this happen in front of you and I'm sitting here in the car and I'm in
*  a dark parking lot and I'm just hearing those gunshots.
*  Where were you? How far from the former president were you?
*  When the shots came from him, I was probably less than three feet from him, maybe four
*  at the most, because I was right up against the stage and he was directly above me.
*  Oh, my God. Doug, you yourself could have been hit.
*  Believe me, Serena, I when he was whisked off, I turned around and I saw people scattering
*  and I thought, oh, my God, I was right in the line.
*  My heart was pounding through my chest and I was shaking and I was just like, I can't
*  believe this happened.
*  So tell me exactly what you saw through your camera lens, Doug.
*  What were you looking at right before?
*  And then what did you see exactly at the moment that it happened?
*  I was focused on the president as he was making his remarks.
*  There was a huge flag, American flag above him flying.
*  I was trying to do something that showed him on the podium and him with the flag up
*  there. And I was in the right moment as far as concentrating and being right there.
*  So I could see him.
*  And then the former president was making remarks.
*  He was gesturing towards his right.
*  And when he put his hand out to gesture, take a look at what happened.
*  There were these three or four loud pops.
*  And I just kept taking pictures and it all became a blur.
*  I just kept my finger on the shutter.
*  And then he grabbed his ear and then fell from behind the podium.
*  I didn't see him behind the Trump sign.
*  And I ran to the left to try and see what was going on.
*  And by that time, he was being covered by the Secret Service.
*  And there was a lot of yelling and pushing and, you know, just them trying to protect
*  him and getting over top of him.
*  I'm positive I heard them say, sir, sir, sir.
*  You know, and I think they were just trying to see how bad he was.
*  He was hit. And after that, it was very chaotic.
*  There was a lot of like, move back, get out of the way, move back.
*  Did you know where the gunman was?
*  No, I only knew that the pops came definitely from my left ear.
*  I could hear it very loud.
*  So I assume that's where they came from.
*  And did that person continue to shoot?
*  I thought I heard maybe two or three more shots.
*  After the former president disappeared from your lens.
*  Correct. Yeah. And I don't know if that was a Secret Service shooting back at that
*  point, but I did hear more than the first three or four.
*  I mean, they were very quick, which now that I look back, I was an idiot to be that
*  close. But instincts just brought me closer to the stage to try and see what was going
*  on. And then when they brought him up, I thought, oh, my God, he's OK.
*  He's alive. And then he put his fist up.
*  And then as he got closer to the steps, he kind of stopped with the agents.
*  And I could tell the agents were trying to put their arms over him to shield him.
*  And he was defying and putting his fist up.
*  And he didn't say anything, but he just pumped his fist.
*  What did you think when you saw Trump do that?
*  You captured that moment. What did you think when he did that?
*  Oh, he was just so just pissed off, like defiant.
*  That's all that I could think of is, God, he's mad as hell.
*  He is really mad.
*  You know, the image that you took of former President Trump pumping his fist in the air
*  with the blood on his face, with a Secret Service all huddled around him, the one you
*  referenced, this photo is in many ways already becoming really the iconic photo
*  of this moment, defining the episode in history, really.
*  Did you know immediately that would be the case?
*  I didn't, Sabrina, I didn't.
*  I didn't know what I, you know, because it was happening so fast.
*  And at that point, my camera went from in my eye to lifting it up above me and just
*  because there were people in front of me, you know, I just I had no idea that it would
*  be the image it is until I saw it on the camera afterwards when I was shaking and looking
*  at my pictures thinking, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.
*  You know, it brings chills to me.
*  It is definitely an image that I'll think about when I close my eyes tonight to go to
*  sleep. It's a wee hour in the morning.
*  Doug, there's one photograph you took with a kind of blurred, moving image, and it looks
*  like it might actually be a bullet, a bullet streaking past the former president.
*  Can you talk about that photo?
*  Is that actually one of the bullets?
*  I never thought that I would have a picture of the bullet behind him.
*  But after the event had happened and I'm looking through my camera at pictures that I'm
*  going to send to the office and I said to the editor, Jennifer, listen, Jen, I'm sending
*  you the sequence of when he was speaking, when the shots rang out.
*  And please look at him closely, because at that point, there were speculation that he
*  was not shot.
*  And, you know, I called Maggie, one of our reporters, and Maggie Haberin said, hey, Maggie,
*  I definitely think he was shot because he looks to his right, he looks to his left,
*  he was shot because he looks to his right, he flinches, he grabs his ear, his hand has
*  blood on it at that point.
*  And then he went down.
*  So when I asked Jen, can you look at him closely?
*  And Jen said, I will.
*  And she literally text me back a minute later and said, you won't believe this.
*  We think there's a picture of the bullet flying behind the former president's head.
*  And I said, what?
*  And I'm getting chills now because I now that I've seen the picture and I am looking at
*  the sequence because there's nothing there, nothing there, nothing there.
*  And then it's right behind his head.
*  And of course, we haven't at this hour, 9 54 p.m., exactly confirmed that this is the
*  image of the bullet that hurt him.
*  But it certainly seems like it could be that you captured the exact moment that he got
*  shot.
*  It was, I mean, from what I can tell, it's definitely a bullet that was fired at him,
*  whether it hit him or not is TBD.
*  I just don't know at this time.
*  Like you said.
*  Doug, you said that when this shooting happened, that your instinct was to keep your
*  finger on the shutter.
*  And, you know, that's a pretty unique instinct.
*  It's a photographer instinct.
*  And I love that.
*  I'm assuming that's all kind of your accumulated experience over the decades.
*  You know, you referenced this earlier, but you've covered presidents for four decades.
*  You've captured the most historic moments probably present for more of the history in
*  our country than any other journalist in Washington.
*  How are you thinking about this event in the context of all of the others that you've
*  been present for?
*  Yeah, this is by far the most remarkable and sad situation that I've ever witnessed.
*  You know, the person running for president, United States, someone's trying to
*  end their life.
*  And, you know, as a photographer, you hope that if you're there for that day, that you
*  you're able to do your job and then you're in the right place to do your job.
*  And that's all I kept thinking, you know, was I was trying to run around the stage,
*  trying to, you know, just to see, you know, how the president was doing.
*  And I hope I didn't blink.
*  I hopefully captured what happened, and that's what my job is to record history.
*  And this is definitely one of those historic moments that sadly I was a part of.
*  But also, I'm grateful that I didn't I didn't flinch and I didn't blink and I wasn't
*  shot. So I'm grateful for that.
*  Yes, you were our witness, Doug.
*  Well, thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Glenn, you've been reporting on the investigation into the shooting at President
*  Trump's rally on Saturday.
*  We're talking to you at 4.55 p.m.
*  on Sunday.
*  Before we get to the details of what's been found so far, what do we know about how
*  Trump is doing in the last few weeks?
*  And what are the things that you think are going to be happening in the coming weeks?
*  And what are the things that you think are going to be happening in the coming weeks?
*  And what are the things that you think are going to be happening in the coming weeks?
*  What do we know about how Trump is doing, how he's been in the hour since the
*  shooting? Remarkably well.
*  Well, it was sort of shocking on television.
*  You could see the blood splatter across his cheek.
*  It was an injury on his ear, but his injuries were relatively minimal.
*  He was cleared at a local hospital, flew back to his golf resort at Bedminster in
*  New Jersey and has made it entirely clear that he doesn't have any intention to
*  skip the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week.
*  And do we know for sure it was a bullet that hit him?
*  That's a little bit ambiguous.
*  There were some reports that he was injured by flying glass from his teleprompter.
*  But in a truth social post, he said he was shot by a bullet.
*  And in a conference call today with the FBI, they refused to address the issue at
*  all. Got it.
*  And what about the people in the crowd who were also hit?
*  One man was killed.
*  His name is Corey Comparator, and he was apparently shielding his family from the
*  gunfire. And in addition, two other bystanders were seriously injured and they
*  were taken to the hospital.
*  So, Glenn, what is the picture that law enforcement has pieced together about
*  what happened on Saturday?
*  Well, the FBI and Department of Justice are investigating this as an assassination
*  attempt and also a potential incident of domestic terrorism.
*  And here's the picture that they've compiled.
*  It started off as a regular Trump rally.
*  Everything seemed to be in order.
*  People were in a good mood.
*  Trump started speaking at around 6 p.m.
*  and roughly 10 minutes into his speech, Trump was talking about immigration.
*  That's when a gunshot is heard.
*  Trump stops mid-sentence, then he flinches.
*  Trump then clutched his ear and you could see the splatter of blood across his
*  cheeks. Then another two shots are quickly fired and he ducks behind the podium.
*  And almost immediately, this whole clutch of Secret Service agents surrounds Trump.
*  And then you hear a burst of about five more shots.
*  The crowd was completely disoriented.
*  Some people were sort of cheering.
*  Other people started screaming.
*  And you could see behind Trump that folks were responding to those people who had
*  been injured. At some point, a Secret Service sniper shoots back and
*  kills the shooter.
*  We know from looking at footage that at this point, he's lying dead on a rooftop
*  about 400, 500 feet away from Trump.
*  And some of the images show an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle laying near his
*  body. The Secret Service are still laying on top of Trump, shielding him.
*  Then you hear a couple of seconds later, shooter down, shooter down.
*  And it's at that point that they start to move.
*  The agents that surround him kind of in a shell slowly move him off stage.
*  And the thing I found most extraordinary, having covered Trump on and off all these
*  years, is how quickly, when he realized that he was physically OK, that he
*  pivoted to a complete understanding of what the image was, what the moment meant
*  politically. And there's just this extraordinary moment of defiance where he
*  balls his fists and the crowd starts to chant USA, USA, USA.
*  I just can't emphasize how extraordinary that was.
*  And just like he had this instinct that this may have been a horrific event, but
*  he was somehow seeing it as a political one.
*  He was making use of it and really connecting with the people at the rally.
*  Somebody who worked with Trump for many years said this to me a long time ago.
*  A lot of other politicians play the music.
*  They can read the notes.
*  Trump can hear the music.
*  And that was one of those moments where he intuitively understood the moment,
*  understood the image, understood the sound and behaved in a way that maximized
*  his position going forward.
*  It was really, really something else.
*  OK, so on the shooter, it wasn't that he somehow passed through a security check
*  or evaded a security check.
*  He was just completely outside the zone that the Secret Service considered the
*  zone of danger, right?
*  The shooter was completely outside the event on a warehouse roof outside of where
*  Trump was speaking. There's some reporting that he may have attempted to get in
*  earlier. But part of the complication here was that he wasn't actually within
*  the perimeter of the event itself.
*  Got it. And what is the Secret Service saying about why it was that that
*  building with an apparent clear shot of the podium was outside the perimeter?
*  Well, the Secret Service is an independent security agency that's responsible for
*  the protection of the president and other senior American officials.
*  Candidates get protection as well, but they don't operate in isolation.
*  When they come to a town, they often coordinate with local law enforcement.
*  Sometimes you'll see, for instance, state police sealing off highways when the
*  motorcade comes through. Well, oftentimes Secret Service will have control over
*  the event itself while local law enforcement is tasked with controlling things
*  outside of the perimeter.
*  That appears to have been what happened in Pennsylvania.
*  There were four counter sniper teams on Saturday, two Secret Service and two local.
*  And the building outside the perimeter would typically have been under the purview
*  of local law enforcement.
*  Got it. So basically, Secret Service was taking care of security inside the lines of
*  that perimeter and local law enforcement was taking care of the security outside
*  those lines. And that's where the shooter was shooting from outside the lines.
*  Do we know what happened with local law enforcement there?
*  How this shooter getting to the top of a roof ended up kind of falling through the
*  cracks for them?
*  Nobody's quite sure, but the speed with which this happened seems to have been an
*  important dynamic. It wasn't like this guy was camped out for hours.
*  It appears that he scrambled up onto the roof of the warehouse, moving rather
*  quickly and planted himself and then fired.
*  So there wasn't a lot of time for law enforcement to react, apparently.
*  And what do we know so far about the shooter?
*  What have investigators learned?
*  His name is Thomas Matthew Crooks.
*  He is 20 years old.
*  He's from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, which is about 40 miles from the scene of the
*  shooting. He was generally regarded in school as a quiet, intelligent guy,
*  and he'd been working as a dietary aide at a local nursing home.
*  And investigators told us that he was interested in chess and that he had
*  recently taken up computer coding.
*  And what did the authorities say about his motive?
*  They don't know. That is the big question.
*  The public record is very scant.
*  He is a registered Republican.
*  This would have been his first presidential election voting.
*  And it appears that he gave $15, according to some reports, to a group that
*  generally identifies as liberal.
*  But mostly, I would say investigators are exasperated by the lack of any kind of
*  directionality in terms of what his motivation or political beliefs have been.
*  He has, for instance, not written any kind of a political manifesto.
*  And there aren't even a trail of social media posts to fall back on.
*  They're really hoping that once they are able to breach his cell phone, that that
*  will unlock a trove of information that will point them in the right direction.
*  But he really is an enigmatic character right now.
*  Do authorities think his attack was highly planned?
*  And is there any indication that more attacks were planned?
*  Nobody really knows.
*  The gun that he used was purchased by his father.
*  Authorities are not clear whether or not his father gave it to him, lent it to him,
*  or if he took it from his father.
*  But they don't believe his father bought it on his behalf.
*  What they did find were some explosive devices.
*  There were apparently some canisters found in the car that he had been driving, which
*  served the purpose of delaying the investigation for hours and hours yesterday.
*  As the bomb squad removed and deactivated these devices.
*  And a law enforcement official told me that there was also a suspicious device
*  found at his residence.
*  So he clearly had some knowledge of both firearms and explosives, but they aren't
*  sure where he picked it up and what he intended to do.
*  So this, of course, as you know, is the first time in about 40 years that a
*  current or former president has been wounded in an assassination attempt.
*  Ronald Reagan, of course, was shot in 1981.
*  What fundamentally went wrong here?
*  Is there any way to see this other than as a colossal failure by the Secret Service?
*  I think this is going to be regarded as one of the darkest days in the
*  history of the Secret Service.
*  Now, all of us who have covered the White House have traveled with agents,
*  tremendously high level of professionalism.
*  And the job is difficult bordering on impossible at times, but allowing someone
*  to have a clear firing line to a major presidential candidate in the middle of
*  this kind of highly polarized environment is frankly inconceivable.
*  And I think the other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and folks at
*  the Department of Justice were fairly unvarnished in private in their criticism
*  of the way that the Secret Service planned this.
*  So there are a lot of unanswered questions and some lawmakers have called
*  for there to be a significant investigation of this.
*  And the House Oversight Committee will call the head of the Secret Service to
*  testify over the next couple of weeks.
*  What has Trump said since the shooting?
*  He's been relatively muted.
*  I think one of the really amazing moments and something which has been kind of
*  overlooked, Joe Biden called up Donald Trump and they seem to have had a civil
*  exchange. I think it was this very, very rare and brief moment of comity in this
*  campaign, which is just suffused with negativity and hostility.
*  And then Trump called for national unity and he's basically kind of kept up that
*  vibe for the past 24 hours.
*  But in his signature defiant way, he wrote in a text message to supporters, I
*  will never surrender.
*  And on True Social, he called for his supporters to stand united and not to
*  allow, quote, evil to win.
*  But he really seems to be toeing the line between his typical bombast and
*  adopting a tone, which is a little more conciliatory at a moment when Americans
*  of all political stripes are extremely uneasy and many are just frankly
*  terrified.
*  And what have been the other reactions to this assassination attempt?
*  What's been happening in Washington?
*  What have the people been saying?
*  Democrats and administration officials have called for unity, essentially
*  saying that this was not just an attack on Trump, but an attack on democracy.
*  Look, there's no place in America for this kind of violence.
*  It's sick.
*  It's sick.
*  President Biden made it very clear in a couple of appearances over the weekend
*  that he condemned the violence.
*  We cannot allow for this to be happening.
*  We cannot be like this.
*  We cannot condone this.
*  And said that this kind of reaction, regardless of your political stance, was
*  completely unacceptable.
*  Republicans had a wider range of reactions.
*  There were some in the party who took a measured approach.
*  Everyone needs to turn the rhetoric down.
*  Like from speaker of the House, Mike Johnson.
*  You have political opposition and political opponents, but we're all
*  Americans and we have to treat one another with dignity and respect.
*  But you also heard some Republicans taking a far different approach.
*  You had people like Mike Collins, a kind of a firebrand Republican from Georgia
*  writing on social media that Joe Biden sent the orders to shoot Donald Trump.
*  Wow.
*  Obviously there's no evidence for that.
*  I do believe that Joe Biden is responsible for the shooting today.
*  And you had Lauren Boebert from Colorado in a television interview saying Joe
*  Biden is responsible for the shooting.
*  Everyone who has called him a fascist, everyone who has called him a threat to
*  democracy, who said that he should be.
*  Essentially saying that it was democratic rhetoric that caused this.
*  Again, there's been no evidence whatsoever yet that the shooter was
*  motivated by that kind of rhetoric.
*  But that was a common Republican talking point that you saw emerging to say that
*  using all of this description of Trump as an existential threat to democracy had
*  somehow whipped up people to enact violent acts.
*  Okay.
*  So there are some cross currents of rhetoric here in the aftermath of the
*  shooting and we see some signs of unity, but it seems undeniable that this is a
*  very fraught political moment.
*  How much have you been hearing in your reporting about the
*  possibility of further violence?
*  It's a huge fear and it's building upon concerns that FBI and justice department
*  officials have talked to us about for months and months and months that they
*  are worried about violence springing up in this election on a call on Sunday.
*  They reiterated that the threat level is really high for months.
*  They've been telling us that they're worried about shootings, spawning
*  copycats, and also outside of violence.
*  It's this wave of misinformation that tends to accompany these big events
*  that can also create a bad cycle.
*  People get whipped up and that in turn incites more violence.
*  So I think there is a level of tremendous uncertainty and political
*  conventions as we have seen in years past are a gathering point for all kinds
*  of folks, mostly people who are engaged in peaceful protests, but it's also been
*  catalytic for individuals who want to create all kinds of problems.
*  I think if there is a silver lining, it is that this near miss, this near national
*  catastrophe has alerted law enforcement agencies, particularly the secret service
*  to up their vigilance to the highest possible level.
*  So to a certain extent, like a near miss of an airliner potentially crashing, it
*  might have the positive impact of having people pay more attention at a time of
*  what appears to be maximum danger.
*  Glenn, what happens now?
*  I mean, you mentioned political conventions.
*  The Republican National Convention is starting on Monday.
*  Do we have any idea of how that event will play out given what just happened?
*  How this changes things?
*  Well, first and foremost, I think you're going to see a level of security at both
*  conventions that's unprecedented in terms of the political impact.
*  That's a little harder to predict.
*  This presents Donald Trump with an enormous opportunity to reset his image, but it's an
*  entirely unpredictable political environment and the situation could change.
*  I think its greatest meaning, its most resonant meaning is that our politics is
*  changing and moving into a darker and more dangerous place.
*  And the question is, are we entering an age where political violence becomes
*  commonplace or is this a moment where we realize collectively that this is not the
*  future we can accept?
*  And what happens in the next few days is going to be quite important to help give
*  an answer to that.
*  Indeed.
*  Glenn, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should know today.
*  On Saturday, Israel conducted a major airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip that it said
*  targeted Hamas's top military commander, who was allegedly one of the architects of
*  the October 7th attack on Israel.
*  Gazan health authorities said that at least 90 people died in the assault, but the
*  commander targeted in the strike, Mohammed Daif, was among them.
