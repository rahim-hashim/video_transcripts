# Election 2024 Early Voting, Dance Parties and Third Parties
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAWjnR0LgqU)
*  Over the past few days, Donald Trump has grown more and more erratic on the campaign trail.
*  Let's not do any more questions. Let's just listen to music. Let's make it into our music.
*  Who the hell wants to hear questions?
*  Kamala Harris has pursued a strategy aimed directly at black men.
*  I am running to be president for everybody, but I am clear-eyed about the history and
*  the disparities that exist for specific communities, and I'm not going to shy away from that.
*  And we got our first wave of early voting data that's telling us something
*  about the energy level of the American electorate.
*  Voters are voting. It's here. It's happening. Look at those numbers.
*  Three hundred and twenty-eight thousand people in Georgia.
*  To make sense of all of that, I gathered three of my colleagues from the Times Politics Desk.
*  Lisa Lair, Shane Goldmacher, and Rebecca Davis-O'Brien.
*  I'm Michael Bobarro, and this is The Daily.
*  Okay, let's get started. Welcome to our fourth, but by no means final, campaign roundtable.
*  As always, I'm going to timestamp this conversation in case something happens after we talk.
*  It is around one o'clock on Wednesday afternoon.
*  That's when we're having this conversation in case the world changes profoundly afterwards.
*  On to the roundtable. It feels, friends, like we're seeing in this final stretch of this race,
*  these very heightened versions of the two candidates' behaviors.
*  One deeply disciplined, the other not at all.
*  So let's start there with the truly erratic and for some alarming behavior of the Republican
*  nominee, Donald Trump, over the past few days. What happened? What explains it?
*  Why, if at all, does it matter?
*  So I think your point is a really good one.
*  It's erratic, but also deeply on brand for Donald Trump. And it's a number of things,
*  but the most striking one happened on Monday night where Donald Trump was at a town hall in
*  Oaks, Pennsylvania. And that's, you know, a normal kind of campaign thing. People ask questions,
*  he responds. It went a little awry early. Two people passed out. They had to pause it.
*  Also something that happens pretty frequent. People are waiting a long time. It's hot.
*  They're standing up. Older people, it can be difficult. But then it went really awry.
*  Basically, 30 or so minutes in, Donald Trump sort of stopped the entire event and decided that the
*  whole audience would listen to his Spotify list.
*  But it wasn't just like he didn't just do like a musical interlude.
*  No, it was extended.
*  Almost 40 minutes of him playing DJ, which he likes to do, but just usually not in public.
*  So what's happening on the stage?
*  He's dancing.
*  He's dancing?
*  Yes. Kristi Noem, who is supposed to be interviewing him at this event, is also dancing,
*  kind of trying to follow his moves. You know, the fist pumps, the hand waves. But this went on for
*  an extended period of time. It's not generally what a past and or future potential president does
*  in the final three weeks of an extraordinarily razor tight campaign.
*  I just like to imagine what the average voter would think. Seeing Donald Trump with his kind
*  of hands splayed while Kristi Noem looks confused. And then he just ends it. I mean,
*  it's a very strange, I mean, we're laughing, but it was also part of a week of strange and alarming
*  behavior. Right. But I do think there's an important, so while he was dancing, I was with
*  Harris on the other side of the state at a rally event. She was having an eerie Pennsylvania,
*  which is a really important swing county, particularly for Democrats. And she is on the
*  stage, you know, several hundred miles west, assailing him as erratic, which was the word we
*  use here and also as like a really fundamental threat to some foundational American principles.
*  So he was playing into the choice that she is really trying to present to voters in these
*  final weeks. And Lisa had a story about this. I mean, what's really interesting is she's made
*  two cases against Trump, both that he is personally an unserious man, but also that he poses a serious
*  threat to the country. And then across the state, he's, of course, giving evidence, at least of her
*  unserious claims as he's standing, swaying, dancing at his own rally. Right. And on the serious
*  threat claim, I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within. He's also feeding into that
*  claim as well. Should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by national guard or if really
*  necessary by the military. You know, he was out this week in an interview on Sunday talking about
*  how he would potentially deploy the military to target liberals who, you know, oppose him.
*  Adam shifty shiv, who's a total sleazebag, is going to become a senator. But I call him the enemy from
*  within. Including some members of Congress. That, Lisa, is not just erratic behavior. Arguably,
*  that's potentially a profound abuse of presidential power if he were to win. Yeah. And it's also a
*  ginormous shift in how we think of American government and democracy. Right. A foundational
*  tenet of American norms and American government is that you do not use your power to pursue your
*  political enemies. And this, of course, is not isolated. We just did an episode a few days ago
*  with our colleague Mike Schmidt about how central promises to pursue Trump's enemies not only are
*  there was rhetoric, but were in the first term and maybe in the second term, something that he
*  inspires others in the administration to actually carry out. Shane, this behavior of Trump's over
*  the past week or so, not all of it was public. You were part of a team of reporters who discovered
*  a recent meeting between Trump and his wealthiest donors that turned oddly and very nasty. And I
*  think fits into the larger tapestry of what we're talking about. Yeah. So at the end of September,
*  Trump had a dinner with some of the biggest names and biggest donors in Republican politics.
*  And at this dinner, he was not in a good mood. These are people who are big contributors to the
*  party, but who he felt should be doing more to help him. And he told them so he was complaining
*  about the Jews. He was using, you know, negative terms about Kamala Harris, he called her retarded.
*  Wow. And and he was snapping basically, at these major political contributors. Why? And it's
*  about where this race is on the money front. He is far behind Kamala Harris. She has raised
*  a billion dollars in less than three months as a candidate. I mean, that's just where thing again,
*  a billion dollars in less than three months, completely unheard of. It's more than he's raised
*  the entire year. As of the most recent report, it is the fastest anyone's ever raised that much
*  money when they just start their campaign. And it's double what he had raised in July and August
*  and September. So he's furious at his donors because they're not raising enough money. He wants
*  the big donors to give even more money. And we have new reports showing some of them are.
*  Elon Musk has given $75 million to support him to do a super act. Miriam Adelson has given $100 million.
*  But he wants even more from some of these big contributors. And he's not happy that they have
*  not stepped up in his view sufficiently to do so. OK, so let's put all of this behavior that we're
*  talking about together, because here I want to try to understand if there's a strategy. What we can
*  all agree on is that this race is going to hinge on persuading just a handful of still persuadable
*  voters. And is anything that we're talking about here, especially some of this very erratic behavior
*  from Trump in public, is that intended to do that? It doesn't appear to be. Or is there something
*  strategic going on here? I mean, I think you have to differentiate the candidate and the campaign
*  for Donald Trump, which is his campaign has a plan to try to reach those voters. They have
*  messages that they would like Donald Trump to deliver. He does not always deliver the messages
*  that they would like. You just have to divide the campaign and the candidate for him. And you see,
*  with Harris, there's not that clear divide between what the campaign wants her to be doing and what
*  she's actually doing. There's a more unified. And that has come back, I think, I mean, it's important
*  to note that supporters of Donald Trump have said, you know, she's so staged, she's so scripted. This
*  becomes sort of a theme for her. And he is sort of the anti-scripted candidate. But it is also,
*  has been a liability. He has lost or his party has underperformed in every single election since
*  2016. And in part, it is over the stylistic questions on measures of character and temperament.
*  He scores lower than she does. So it's what his supporters love about him. And it's what hurts
*  him with, you know, or has historically hurt him with some persuadable voters, and particularly
*  women, which we definitely see in this election. So let's now turn to Kamala Harris and this far
*  more strategic, far more intentional behavior that you've all been alluding to over the past few days.
*  I think that was very clearly demonstrated by the way in which she has been focused this past week
*  on a single constituency. And that is black men. Polls show, and you guys can better explain this
*  than me, she's vastly underperforming Joe Biden with that group of voters. A very complicated
*  thing to contemplate given that she herself is black and Joe Biden is not. And she went on
*  The Breakfast Club, a show hosted by Charlamagne the God. It has a very large black audience. And
*  I want to talk about what that tells us about her strategy. She has spent much of this week
*  trying to make these inroads with black men. And this is a constituency that's historically been
*  a bastion of the Democratic Party. She will win a majority of black men. The question is,
*  is some portion, a larger portion, either voting for Donald Trump or deciding they don't want to
*  vote at all? So she's been trying to win them over. And it's largely through policy plans.
*  She's been talking about economic plans, housing, cost plans, all sorts of things like that, that
*  she thinks will benefit them. But she also has an ad out. They've ran out a new ad that's really
*  directly addressing black men and sort of hints at this idea of sexism, that maybe there's some
*  sexism implicit. What does the ad say? Yeah, so she actually has multiple ads right now dealing
*  exactly with this. And it's different people for different states. So she has one ad running in the
*  Philadelphia market with a black man talking about the need for black men to step up for Kamala
*  Harris that women have carried the load and it's time for them to step up for her too. And a similar
*  ad running in another state, in one of the other blue wall states. So this is a surround sound
*  approach she has. And I think it's even not just her appearances. It's Barack Obama who made his
*  first appearance on the campaign trail last week. And he talked about the need for black men to step
*  up. You have explicitly, very explicitly in ways that I think was surprising, right? This is not,
*  can you just talk about that for me? Because I was struck by the manner in which he talked about it.
*  It was not just explicit. It was kind of scolding. Yeah. So he went to the Pittsburgh area.
*  I'm going to go ahead and just say, speak some truths if you don't mind.
*  And went to a field office and gave a speech. And you're thinking about sitting out
*  here and you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses. I've got a problem with that.
*  And he basically said, you guys got to step up. That there is not a reason not to be voting for
*  Kamala Harris and that black men in particular need to do this. And it's interesting coming from
*  Obama who didn't speak to that constituency very often as president in that kind of way.
*  I heard something else in Barack Obama's message, Shane, which was not that black men just needed
*  to step up, but that he suspected sexism. Part of it makes me think that, well,
*  you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.
*  He said, I worry that black men in this country are struggling to envision electing a black woman.
*  That's not acceptable. This shouldn't even be a question.
*  And there were some concerns that maybe that was not the best tone to take. Like,
*  nobody likes being scolded. Nobody likes being told that they're sexist or whatever.
*  So you saw a little bit of an effort to kind of clean that up, I think, on that interview on
*  The Breakfast Club, where you had Charlamagne Lagarde come out and say, when are Liz Cheney and
*  Hillary Clinton going to wave their finger at white women? When are Bill Clinton and Joe Biden
*  going to wave their finger at white men? Why aren't they scolding white men? Why
*  aren't they scolding white women? Well, I think what is happening is that we are all
*  working on reminding people of what is at stake. And, you know, Harris really didn't bite at that
*  question. On The Breakfast Club, there was a caller who called in and said, what are you going to do
*  economically to help support black men? My plan includes making sure that for first-time home
*  buyers, they have a $25,000 down payment assistance. And she answered with her list of
*  economic measures that she's laid out in her campaign over the last few weeks. And Charlamagne
*  Lagarde, actually, it might have been, I forget which of them pointed this out, but those were
*  not racially specific. They're for everyone. And that was sort of her point. It's like in helping
*  all of middle class and helping all working Americans, she is helping black Americans.
*  Everything I just talked about will benefit everybody. Small business owners, whatever
*  their race, their age, their gender. I think she kind of repeatedly on this interview took a
*  specific question or specific targeted audience and broadened it to say, like, actually, what I'm
*  trying to do is help everybody, not just black men. Well, how's that supposed to work if the point of
*  going on a show like that is to reach a particular kind of voter? Why not be specific? It's also who
*  she is. Like, she is not someone who really likes to talk about identity in those kinds of ways.
*  And I think we're seeing that throughout the campaign. And I think there's reasons. It's not
*  just personal. I think that is a reflection of who she is. It's also a calculation, obviously,
*  as all things in campaigns are. And so they don't want to do anything that would alienate anybody.
*  To Lisa's point, for Kamala Harris's whole career, she's been breaking barriers and not talking about
*  it. She downplayed and has downplayed that her whole career. This has not been how she's pursued
*  higher office. And look, that's important in this race where she does need black men to turn out in
*  high numbers. She needs to win them overwhelmingly to win this election. But she also needs a whole
*  bunch of other constituencies. So this is all a balancing act for her. Right. This is not just
*  about Kamala Harris's nature not to emphasize that she might be the first person to do something.
*  It's strategically designed not to alienate specific voters that she might need as much,
*  if not more. If you're Kamala Harris, you need parts of every demographic group to win. I mean,
*  let's just think about Pennsylvania, which is where Trump was swaying and where Harris was in
*  Erie. And that both candidates would do anything to win. Would do absolutely anything to win. She
*  needs to win black voters in Philadelphia by large numbers. She needs to win suburban voters in the
*  color counties outside of Philadelphia by large numbers. And that's really appealing to suburban
*  white women. She needs to lose by less in the rural areas throughout the rest of the state.
*  She actually needs to squeeze out extra votes in the fast growing Latino heavy towns in eastern
*  Pennsylvania. And she has to do all of those things to win that state and all the other swing
*  states on the map. Rebecca, it's always been very clear that for Kamala Harris in particular, victory
*  relies on winning the upper Midwest, winning Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. You have been
*  reporting very specifically on an unforeseen obstacle for Harris there. Third party candidacies.
*  I think an issue a lot of us forgot about when RFK Jr. dropped out of the race. Tell us what you
*  found. Yes. So, you know, behind the scenes, I mean, of course, Kennedy was sucking up a lot
*  of oxygen in the third party independent candidate space. And as soon as he left the race in August,
*  people were like, oh, that problem's gone. But that's not true. Jill Stein is on the ballot in
*  dozens of states in the Green Party. Cornell West got on a bunch of ballots. And there's also
*  the Libertarian Party, the Constitution Party. There's a socialist party that has, whose candidate
*  is on the ballot in a bunch of states as well. In Wisconsin alone, there are eight presidential
*  candidates on the ballot, including six third party or independent candidates. And this is going
*  to be a similar situation in Michigan, where this could potentially be a real issue for Vice
*  President Harris. Just explain that. It's a real issue for Vice President Harris, because in Michigan,
*  as we've seen, there's a sizable number of people, of voters who have said they are not going to
*  support her because of her stance on Israel and Gaza. There's a large Arab American community,
*  and there's a lot of disaffection with the Democratic Party and their overall approach to
*  this war. Right. We've done an episode about this. There's a group of voters that are calling
*  themselves the uncommitted, and they are uncommitted to either side because they're very angry about
*  this war. And the expectation traditionally has been that many of them would support the Democratic
*  candidate. Right. These voters may either sit out or they might just choose a third party candidate
*  as a protest vote, essentially. Right. And now they have many, many options, you're saying, to
*  pick a third party candidate. Right. And let me just be clear about something. Our latest polling
*  shows that Jill Stein is polling at about like 1% nationally. However, the narrative is,
*  Jill Stein's a spoiler for Democrats. It's a very big source of concern. Earlier this week,
*  the DNC actually put out its first ad in these swing states that said, a vote for Stein is a
*  vote for Trump, which is about as clear as it gets. I mean, the action speaks louder than anything
*  else, right? It's the Democratic Party that's out there talking about the problems of these
*  third party candidates. It's the Democratic Party putting out an ad attacking Jill Stein. It's the
*  Democratic Party that didn't want Cornel West to get on the ballots in these states. Right.
*  Their behavior tells you that they think this is a concern because they want voters who might not
*  love Kamala Harrison before that, might not love Joe Biden to say, it's Donald Trump or, and you
*  don't want a third alternative in that debate. You want them to pick. Right. Because the suspicion
*  here, especially when it comes to the uncommitted voters in Michigan, is that they don't really want
*  to vote for Donald Trump. He's even further to the right and pro-Israel than Kamala Harris is.
*  So the notion is, if you just give those voters two choices, they're very likely to pick Harris.
*  If you give them eight choices, who knows? Right. The biggest motivator for the Democratic
*  Party over the past eight years has been none other than Donald Trump. They have fueled their
*  winds on this very strong wave of anti-Trump sentiment. And even now, views about Trump are
*  really cemented. Like there's a really, really, really small number of people who are like,
*  I don't know what I think about Trump. So in some ways for Democrats, this is a fight on the margins
*  about persuading maybe some small number of people who are open to switching. Maybe they voted for
*  him in 20 and they're open to voting for her. But more significantly, this is a fight between
*  people staying home or voting third party or voting for Harris. It's a matter of keeping their
*  forces together, not so much from switching sides, but just getting them out and getting them voting
*  for her. Okay. Moving along, this is the very first time on a round table that we can really
*  talk about early voting because we now have hard numbers. They're starting to come in because people
*  are actually early voting. We got our first real batch of those numbers on Tuesday night out of
*  Georgia. And the numbers were pretty eye popping. Let me just summarize them for you. By the end of
*  Tuesday, more than 300,000 voters in Georgia had cast ballots. 300,000 compared with 136,000
*  voters the first day of early voting in 2020 and 134,000 first day of early voting in 2022,
*  which basically means more than twice as many people voted early this year. I think that
*  tells us something, but what does it tell us? What does that mean? I mean, Michael, you know.
*  How do you air a record shattering first day early voting? I understand we are in a neck and neck
*  race, razor-tight margins, margin to error every state, as you said, and we are all desperate for
*  things to grab onto that will tell us where it's going. You're about to tell me that the first day
*  doesn't matter. I mean, there's a lot more days, right? We don't know what's going to happen to
*  all these other days. We don't necessarily know who those people are who are voting. We don't know
*  how they voted. Well, we know historic patterns tell us that early voting and mail-in voting
*  tends to trend significantly. Yes. However, our big marker on mail-in and early mail-in voting is
*  2020, which, if you may recall, was anomalous. I believe you were in your closet studio then.
*  We were not in this beautiful place. It's a pretty, I mean, it was a once in a century pandemic. So
*  it's not like you can glean that much data from that experience. So I just think let's not.
*  You're caveating it. Let's not overdo it. But, Shane, to the degree it tells us anything,
*  I have to imagine it tells us something about Democratic Party energy in a state like Georgia,
*  because I'm just thinking back four years ago, half as many people voted early in that state.
*  We believe many of them were Democratic voters. Joe Biden won that state over Donald Trump. If
*  that number is twice as big this year, I just wonder if that starts to tell us something about
*  the way we should be thinking about Georgia, a state that for the longest time we thought of as
*  Trump's to lose. I think it tells us about the total amount of energy versus the Democratic or
*  Republican energy, because the Republican Party has been trying to get voters to vote early. They
*  have been scolding voters that actually you can vote early despite what Donald Trump said in 2020.
*  They've been pushing and there's a really sort of mechanical reason why this matters, even if it
*  may not tell us anything about the result, which is the most organized campaigns have a list of
*  voters that they would like to get to the polls. And for those states that say who actually has
*  voted, they can cross them off the list so you don't knock on their door again. You don't send
*  them another mailer. You save money. Your targeting becomes more sophisticated. It's a smaller and
*  smaller universe and you can go after them more and more. And so in the states where each individual
*  person who's voted is crossed off those lists, it's an advantage for the more organized campaigns
*  to make sure they focus on the lower propensity voters that they think is going to make the
*  difference. And can't we all just find something to celebrate in the fact that people are voting?
*  It's great. People are voting. We still have a democracy. I mean, Trump isn't just a unifying
*  thing for them. He has brought more people out to vote. We have said voting records since he got
*  into office shatter record after record for turnout. People are more engaged in the process
*  of voting than they were before. Just to close out the early Georgia voting story, I'm sure you
*  all know this. One of those early voters was none other than Jimmy Carter, who just turned 100,
*  voted early. We understand, long live the former president. I love that. Okay. To end this
*  conversation, I want you all to kind of give our listeners a little bit of advice at this late
*  stage in the campaign. Nate Cohn isn't here so we can talk about him behind his back. And it's about
*  polling. At this point in the race, which as we said over and over and over again, is a
*  statistical toss up. How important is it to keep looking at polls that just keep telling us that
*  this race is really, really close? Do you guys look at the polls really closely at this point?
*  What's a useful way of thinking about the role of polls right now? I've been asked this question a
*  lot in my day to day life, as you can imagine. And my advice is disembark from the polar coaster.
*  Don't do it. Look at the averages. Fine. I mean, if this is satisfying to you, if you enjoy looking
*  at polls, which I suspect everyone at this table does, because we're geeks, then fine. Continue,
*  continue with your happy poll viewing. If it causes you anxiety, if you're not sleeping at
*  night, we're rapidly turning into a mental health podcast. Don't look. Don't look. This is a very
*  tight race. It's really, really tight. It's hard to see a major shift at this point in the game,
*  because it's been tight through these seismic political events, like changing the Democratic
*  nominee, some really, really quite a debate performance. It's going to stay tight. So,
*  you know, do what your heart tells you you need to do. But I'm giving everyone permission to get off
*  the polar coaster. Don't pay attention to Nate. That's what you're saying. I try to get my polar
*  coasting in only like lunch hour, like not after dark. It's not good. It's not healthy. Okay. So
*  no polling after dark, no polling while driving. Thank you guys. Just exquisite advice. Rebecca,
*  Lisa, Shane, thank you very much. We really appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks for having us.
*  Thank you. You're very welcome.
