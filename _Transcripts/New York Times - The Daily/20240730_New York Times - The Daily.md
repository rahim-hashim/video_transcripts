# The V.P.’s Search for a V.P.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD7Ts_mrc2o)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Today, what Vice President Kamala Harris is looking for in a running mate, and the challenge
*  of making that choice in record time.
*  My colleague, National Political Correspondent Lisa Lair, takes us inside the selection process.
*  It's Tuesday, July 30th.
*  So Lisa, we turn to you to give us as much insight as possible into a pretty unusual
*  situation, which is the search for a running mate by Kamala Harris, a presidential nominee
*  who up until a week ago was herself the running mate.
*  So she was the thing that she now needs to go out and to find.
*  That's exactly right. Harris is trying to replace herself in a way on the ticket.
*  And this is so, so unusual.
*  I mean, not only is it unusual to have a woman who is vice president picking her own vice
*  president, but the timeline is just extraordinarily short.
*  Her campaign has said that she's likely to make this decision by August 7th.
*  So that's about, what, 10 days from today or so.
*  In total, I think this will be about a two, three week process.
*  And that's just incredibly short to make what's likely to be arguably one of the most
*  consequential decisions of her candidacy. And should she win her presidency?
*  Right. And we should say, you and I know this, we've covered many presidential campaigns
*  and vice presidential searches.
*  Traditionally, this is a process that takes months and months and months.
*  Oh, yeah. This is a process that goes on for quite a long time.
*  Aides and candidates, generally, they start thinking about it during the primary process
*  before they've necessarily even won the nomination.
*  For example, in 2016, when Hillary Clinton ended up being the nominee, there was reporting
*  she began discussions with her aides about this as early as March before she even finalized
*  that she had won the primary against Bernie Sanders.
*  And then, of course, Tim Kaine wasn't announced until four months later in July.
*  So this was quite an extended process. And there's vetting and there's interviews
*  and there's trial balloons. And this is a whole series process that goes
*  on for a really long time. And now the campaign and really the entire
*  country is hyper driving this in about two weeks.
*  Right. And we should add that this rapid timeline is dictated by when Democratic delegates are
*  holding a roll call vote to confirm their presidential and vice presidential nomination.
*  But I'm curious what kind of risk that timeline may introduce into the traditional vetting
*  process for a running mate, a vetting process that takes a long time because it's supposed
*  to take a long time to really vet somebody. Right.
*  This is a process that is designed to mitigate as much risk as possible.
*  And of course, that's impossible in a presidential campaign, given how events can overtake the
*  best laid strategies. But the more time they have to investigate someone, the better.
*  I mean, the first and most important rule in this whole vice presidential process is
*  do no harm, that you don't want to bring someone in who's going to tank the ticket in some
*  way, either because they're unprepared or because there's some skeleton in the closet.
*  So they collect reams of information from each candidate, from their legal documents,
*  financial documents. Sometimes they get private investigators to dig into their background.
*  There's a series of interviews with aides, with the candidate themselves. They vet their
*  policy positions to see where they agree and disagree with the candidate, what they've
*  said in the past. So this is a really deep dive, but this year it's more like a little
*  polar bear plunge.
*  Right. It just cannot be what it has been in the past, given this timeline.
*  So let's talk about, given those accelerated circumstances, what we understand to be Kamala
*  Harris's criteria, as best we understand it, for a running mate, what she's looking for.
*  And what has emerged as her priorities when she picks a number two.
*  Well, to start with, I think we should establish here that it's a little more difficult this
*  year for us to get as in this process as it's typically been because it's so fast.
*  It's been really tightly held.
*  She doesn't even have a full campaign team.
*  She's inherited the Biden team.
*  Right now, her staff is still figuring out what roles everybody is going to have in this
*  new operation. So this isn't the sort of normal process where there's a ton of leaks and it
*  all comes out and the circle is really big and we can really get in there.
*  You're saying, Elisa, that this is a hard journalistic undertaking and that we should
*  give you some patience here.
*  Yeah, I think this is look, VP is always a hard journalistic undertaking because it's
*  something that the campaign wants to announce on their own time.
*  And you're trying to figure it out before they're ready to tell you.
*  However, there's usually a lot of people around who hear things, who want to talk.
*  It's a major, you know, Washington rumor mill thing.
*  And what do political people love more than gossip?
*  I have to tell you, not much.
*  But this year, the circle of gossip is a lot smaller and that makes it much more speculative
*  than it even normally is.
*  But that being said, we can tell from the names that we've seen coming out one way that
*  certainly Harris and her team are thinking about this.
*  And we are sort of relying a little bit on our own understanding of how this process
*  has worked in the past, which is this idea that you have to balance the ticket.
*  Well, just explain that concept.
*  Well, part of this means doing a careful assessment of what your candidate is and isn't
*  and thinking about how to fill those gaps.
*  So, for example, if you had a candidate who's an older man, you probably want to go with
*  someone younger. If you have a candidate who is from a liberal state, maybe you want to
*  go with someone from a more conservative state.
*  And the goal of this is to obviously broaden the appeal of the ticket.
*  You don't necessarily want to double down on what you have.
*  You want to find a way to bring more voters into the fold.
*  So let's run this exercise through Harris, which is what we know is part of what her
*  aides and the people around her are doing.
*  Harris is, of course, a woman.
*  She's, of course, from this very, very liberal state, California, and she's, of course, a
*  black woman. So what does that mean?
*  And we see what that means from the names that we're hearing are sort of in the top
*  tier of people who are being considered.
*  It means her staff is looking at someone who's maybe from a less liberal state, probably
*  a battleground state. It means they're looking at men.
*  And it means really that what they're looking at is white men.
*  Right. Which is interesting, of course, because that description is quite literally the
*  inverse of what Joe Biden did when looking for a running mate back in 2020 to
*  balance his ticket.
*  He said by the end of that selection process, I am going to pick a black woman.
*  Right. And look, they're dealing with really different concerns here.
*  For Biden, it was a question of representing the entire country and more importantly, the
*  entirety of the Democratic Party, which is a really diverse party of which black voters
*  are a backbone of that party.
*  So his team and the president felt that they had to encompass the entirety of the
*  coalition that they were hoping to win over to get into the White House.
*  For Harris, this is a really different calculation.
*  And part of this calculation is a question of what America is ready for.
*  Is America ready for a ticket that has two women or has two people of color?
*  And the answer from a lot of Democrats that we hear is no, that that is too risky of a
*  ticket and America will not go there.
*  That one historic first is about as far as the country is willing to go and is the sort
*  of risk that they are willing to take here.
*  So according to that logic, even picking a female running mate from a battleground
*  state and here, of course, I'm thinking about someone like Governor Gretchen Whitmer of
*  Michigan probably doesn't make sense if you're focused on balancing the ticket.
*  That's an active debate in the party.
*  And so there's plenty of Democrats who say, let's go big and that the party should just
*  go for it. Go for two women, do something that would really make a statement about what
*  they think the future of America could be.
*  But then there's a counter side to this.
*  And I think that counter side includes many of people who are in the Harris campaign who
*  say presidential campaigns are about winning and they're not necessarily about making a
*  statement. And that, as you say, might just be too risky.
*  We should say that President Trump has made a very different calculation.
*  His strategy, what he thinks is going to win this race is picking a running mate who is
*  very much himself looking in the mirror.
*  J.D. Vance, a kind of mini version of Donald Trump, a MAGA, hard right Republican and
*  another white dude.
*  That's exactly right.
*  As Trump often does, he threw out the conventional wisdom, you know, on vice presidential
*  picks and doubled down on, as you say, himself and picked in Vance a guy that could really
*  carry the mantle of MAGA Trumpism into a new generation.
*  And frankly, the first few weeks haven't gone all that well.
*  Vance has had a tough debut.
*  He's had a number of awkward public appearances.
*  I had a diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today.
*  I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too, but.
*  It's good.
*  I love you guys.
*  He's gotten blowback as Democrats have brought out comments that he made years ago.
*  We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by
*  a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that
*  they've made. Most centrally, these attacks on childless women and whether they should
*  have the same voting rights as people with kids.
*  You should have more power.
*  You should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our Democratic Republic than
*  people who don't have kids.
*  And he's faced criticism not only from Democrats, of course, but even some Republicans
*  who have questioned whether Trump made the right choice here and whether Vance was
*  experienced and tested enough to really be an asset to the Republican Party ticket.
*  For Harris, that means that she is now picking someone with the awareness of the weakness
*  that Vance has brought to the Trump ticket.
*  And she's going to be really looking for someone who can draw out and highlight those
*  weaknesses and really, if at all possible, in her mind, make them more politically
*  detrimental. So in that sense, despite the short timeline, Harris actually has a fair
*  amount of information and perhaps most importantly, an advantage in her effort to
*  select a running mate.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Assuming that Vice President Harris has made this untrumpian calculation that balancing
*  the ticket is the best course and that that is her advantage, she's going to exploit
*  it. Talk us through the top contenders who fit that bill, who would balance the ticket
*  according to your reporting and how they help her balance a ticket and what might keep
*  them from getting the job if they don't.
*  So there's a top tier of contenders here who are about five different candidates.
*  And the easiest way to think about it is there's two from swing states and three from
*  non-swing states.
*  And that's a really important distinction, because as we know, the presidential race is
*  won or lost in this handful of crucially important battleground states, about seven
*  of them. So the two from the swing states are Josh Shapiro, who's the governor of
*  Pennsylvania, and Mark Kelly, the senator from Arizona.
*  And actually, up until just a few hours ago, there was a third swing state contender,
*  Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina.
*  But we just reported tonight that he withdrew his name from consideration.
*  As they say, this is a fluid story.
*  Yes, a very fluid story, at least for the next nine or 10 days.
*  And then in the non-swing state category, we have Andy Beshear, who's the governor of
*  Kentucky, Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and Pete Buttigieg, who's the
*  transportation secretary.
*  Of course, I'm sure a lot of listeners know from when he ran against Harris in the
*  Democratic primary in 2019.
*  Got it. OK, so that is a very long list of white men.
*  Correct. Some from swing states, like you said, some not from swing states.
*  Let's start with the contenders from those battleground states.
*  So why don't we start with the senator on the list, who, of course, is Senator Mark
*  Kelly of Arizona?
*  You know, growing up, we didn't have a lot of money.
*  My parents were both cops and they taught me about public service.
*  Part of what Kelly brings to the ticket is this really compelling personal story.
*  I spent 25 years in the United States Navy as a combat pilot and as an astronaut.
*  He's a former combat veteran, a former astronaut.
*  He married Gabby Giffords, who at the time was a congresswoman from Arizona.
*  Gabby was injured, shot in the head in 2011, and she suffered a serious traumatic
*  brain injury. And she was shot in an act of political violence several years later
*  in her district. He stood by her side.
*  He's helped her convalesce.
*  He's become an advocate for gun control through that process.
*  So we formed an organization to try to make communities and help communities
*  become safer, safer from gun violence.
*  But he's also someone from perhaps one of the swingiest of swing states, a deep
*  purple state that's at the forefront of the political map, not only because of its
*  demographic composition, which includes a lot of Latino voters, but also because
*  it's a border state.
*  When it comes to border security, I've been focused on this.
*  And on immigration, yes, we need comprehensive immigration reform.
*  And he's someone who's really developed a real expertise in immigration, in the
*  border.
*  You know, when I got to Washington, D.C., one of the first things I realized was
*  that Democrats don't understand this issue.
*  And Republicans just want to talk about it and complain about it, but actually not
*  do anything about it.
*  They just want to politicize that.
*  And that's an area that's seen as a weakness for Vice President Harris.
*  So he could help balance the ticket in that way.
*  So he balances the ticket in both a biographical and a policy way, it seems.
*  That's exactly right. And part of his drawback is actually related to his biggest
*  strength here, which is that he is someone who's known for winning these tough races
*  in these purple states.
*  So pulling him out and putting him on the ticket should Harris win means that
*  Democrats would have to deal with an open seat in Arizona in a couple of years from
*  now, actually in the midterm elections of what would be the first Harris term.
*  And of course, an open seat is always a harder race to win than a seat where you
*  have a relatively popular incumbent.
*  So the risk is that Harris might pick Kelly and take someone out of the Senate
*  she might need if she were to become president.
*  Exactly right. And they could risk losing that seat in Arizona.
*  Got it. That leaves us with the other swing state contender on the list, Josh
*  Shapiro of Pennsylvania.
*  Right.
*  So I got a message to Donald Trump.
*  Stop shit talking, America.
*  This is this is the greatest country on the face of the earth.
*  Let's start acting like it.
*  What Shapiro brings is he's someone that has confronted Trumpism very head on.
*  He keeps talking us down and he keeps trying to rip away our fundamental freedoms.
*  And that's something Democrats really like to see.
*  We had an historic win.
*  He defeated this really conservative, MAGA Republican in what was pretty much a
*  blowout election for such a swing state in 2022 to become governor.
*  By way of background, before I was governor, I was attorney general.
*  I sued him over the Muslim ban.
*  I sued him over so many different things and won nearly every time.
*  And then.
*  And before that, he was attorney general in Pennsylvania, where he confronted the
*  Trump administration.
*  He was involved with lawsuits over the Trump administration's election denialism
*  in Pennsylvania.
*  So he's someone who's really gone after MAGA Republicanism.
*  But despite those high profile fights against Trumpism in office, Shapiro has
*  really governed as a bipartisan figure.
*  He's worked across the aisle with Republicans.
*  I'm going to ask you all to turn your attention here to the northbound lanes of
*  I-95.
*  In a most high profile incident, after a section of I-95 collapse because of a
*  fire, he worked with the legislature, with the unions, with contractors, with the
*  federal government to really rebuild that in about two weeks.
*  Right.
*  It was seen as an unusually good example of effective government in a country where
*  government is not seen as effective.
*  Exactly.
*  It was really praised.
*  It got him a lot of good press and it sort of put him on the map as this political
*  figure who could be more than just someone going after the Trump administration.
*  Okay.
*  So what would be the drawback of Shapiro?
*  Because so far it seems like he very much lives in Harris's wheelhouse, fellow
*  prosecutor, good at going after Trump, but balancing the ticket in terms of gender
*  and battleground state appeal.
*  Why might she not pick him?
*  The challenge for Shapiro really stems from his personal biography.
*  Governor Shapiro is an observant Jew who identifies himself as a liberal Zionist.
*  There is no moral equivalency between Hamas and Israel.
*  He's been outspoken both about his faith and about some of what's been going on
*  in Israel in the war against Gaza.
*  We can't allow peaceful protest to be an excuse for antisemitism or
*  Islamophobia on these campuses.
*  He's spoken out against the campus protest, but he's also spoken out against
*  AIPAC.
*  But at a time when the war in Gaza has really divided and roiled the
*  democratic party, there are some concerns about how he'll be received by some parts
*  of the party's liberal base.
*  And some Democrats are worried about whether America is ready to elect a black
*  woman at the top of the ticket with a Jewish man.
*  And I think a lot of Democrats wish this was something that they didn't have to
*  talk about, but the reality is based on many of my conversations, they believe it
*  is something that they have to be concerned about.
*  Okay.
*  Let's focus now on the non-swing state contenders, Toobie Harris' running mate.
*  Well, so first up on that list is Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky.
*  We have been through a lot together.
*  A global pandemic, tornadoes, flooding, wind storms, ice storms.
*  Yet here we stand on the biggest, best economic wind streak this state has ever
*  seen.
*  What he brings to the ticket is he is a popular democratic governor from a deep
*  red rural state.
*  Obviously that's a very unusual position right now in American politics.
*  And so there's some thinking that he could help Democrats with this demographic
*  that's been a consistent problem for them for many years now, which is rural,
*  working class white voters.
*  You have someone who can really go toe to toe with attacking Trump and Vance with
*  this important demographic.
*  Listen, JD Vance is a phony.
*  He ain't from here.
*  He is not from Kentucky.
*  And he's really proven himself pretty deaf in the past two weeks or so as this
*  attack dug, particularly when it comes to Vance.
*  I mean, he first says that Donald Trump is like Hitler and now he's acting like
*  he's Lincoln.
*  I mean, the problem with JD Vance is he has no conviction, but I guess his
*  running mate has 34.
*  But what works against Bashir is related to what works for him, which is that
*  Kentucky is not a state that Democrats are going to win in this election.
*  That's just not even on the map for them.
*  And frankly, white rural working class voters, particularly male voters, are not
*  a demographic they're going to win either.
*  So this is more about the possibility of cutting some of their losses than winning
*  over a crucial swing state or, you know, a really crucial demographic.
*  Fascinating.
*  Okay.
*  I think that brings us to Governor Walz of Minnesota, which is like Kentucky, not
*  exactly a swing state.
*  No, Minnesota, of course, is a very liberal state, one that Democrats are not
*  particularly concerned about holding in this presidential election.
*  These guys are just weird.
*  That's who they are.
*  So it isn't much else.
*  Don't give them the power.
*  Look, are they a threat to democracy?
*  Yes.
*  Are they going to take our rights away?
*  Yes.
*  But what Walz brings is he has been this really effective messenger for the party,
*  particularly in the last two weeks since the possibility of Harris picking a vice
*  president became real.
*  He's really been out there leading on some new lines of democratic attack.
*  The fascists depend on fear.
*  The fascists depend on us going back.
*  But we're not afraid of weird people.
*  We're a little bit creeped out, but we're not afraid.
*  Most centrally, that Republicans are, in his words, just too weird for America.
*  Can you just explain that?
*  Because it does seem like it's sticking a little bit.
*  It does seem like it's sticking and it's a way to capture something that Democrats have
*  been trying in a lot of different ways to do for years now, which is paint Republicans
*  as conservative extremists who are out of touch with where mainstream America is in
*  terms of abortion rights or same sex marriage or families, all kinds of issues like that,
*  that are really intimate issues for voters.
*  And Walz has done it effectively.
*  And we've seen this weird attack line be picked up across the party.
*  Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record.
*  And some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird.
*  But beyond this new weird mess, it's just a little bit of a mess.
*  But beyond this new weird message, he has a compelling biography.
*  As a small town kid turned soldier, football coach, teacher, husband and dad, never did
*  I envision before you, before that I would be here and standing as your Minnesota's
*  41st governor.
*  I know. And neither did you believe that.
*  So he's a former teacher.
*  He's a former veteran.
*  He's someone who comes across as a real Midwestern, which, of course, he is.
*  He has an accent.
*  He's doing press conferences in a T-shirt.
*  And that kind of regional affiliation matters because, of course, Michigan, Wisconsin are
*  really, really important states on the presidential map.
*  Interesting. So he might not be the governor of a swing state, but his appeal extends to
*  those Midwestern swing states you just mentioned.
*  And that could be very powerful, potentially.
*  Yeah, he's in a swing state affinity group here in terms of region and all of that.
*  The drawback with him is that, as you point out, Michael, Minnesota is not a swing state,
*  is in fact a very liberal state.
*  And as governor of this very liberal state, he's championed some fairly liberal policies.
*  He legalized recreational marijuana.
*  He protected access to gender affirming care for transgender people.
*  And these are policies that might not provide the balance that Harris may be looking for,
*  given that she is from a liberal state, California herself.
*  OK, I think finally we have Secretary Buttigieg.
*  So Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who's head of the Transportation Department, really stems
*  from his success on cable news.
*  Now joining us, also fresh off the campaign trail, Pete Buttigieg, he's appearing today
*  in his personal capacity.
*  So he's someone who goes on Fox News, which some Democrats won't do, and counters
*  Republican talking points in this way that gets a lot of traction.
*  Donald Trump made a promise when he was a candidate, one of the few promises he actually
*  kept, by the way, you know, he didn't keep his promise of 6% economic growth.
*  He didn't keep his promise to drain the swamp.
*  He didn't have a pandemic to deal with.
*  Well, but even before the pandemic, even before the pandemic, America...
*  He has this ability to see a viral moment and seize on it, whether it's, you know,
*  dealing with airline fees because everyone's always mad at the airlines or it's refuting
*  Republican talking points.
*  He kept his promise to destroy the right to choose in this country.
*  And if you want to know what a second Trump term would be like, I would start by looking
*  at those rare promises that he actually managed to keep.
*  He did say that he wanted to get rid of Roe v.
*  Wade, but again, send it to the states where they are actually...
*  Yeah, empower the states to eliminate women's access to abortion.
*  And also, as you know, the Republican Party continues to be interested in a national
*  abortion ban.
*  Which he's disavowed completely.
*  Yeah, he's disavowed a lot of things.
*  I don't believe him.
*  And that's made him really beloved among large quarters of the Democratic base, who, of
*  course, know him quite well from his primary run four years ago.
*  But what could hold him back is, in fact, another issue of how much history is America
*  willing to make.
*  As experienced being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S.
*  Supreme Court.
*  He's, of course, a very high profile gay man.
*  He's married. He has two kids.
*  And it's just as some Democrats worry about the history making potential of Governor
*  Shapiro, they also worry about whether America is really ready to elect a gay man.
*  But there's another issue, too.
*  Buttigieg is really a liberal hero.
*  He's someone who's risen to prominence through his support in liberal America and in a
*  lineup where so many of the potential candidates appeal to moderate and conservatives.
*  That may not be something that Buttigieg really brings to the ticket.
*  Lisa, given that Vice President Harris starts this general election behind Trump, not as
*  much as perhaps before or as much as Biden, but still a little bit behind, I guess the
*  question becomes, are any of these non swing state contenders so compelling that it's
*  worth not choosing a running mate who might help deliver one of these electoral college
*  vote rich battleground states?
*  Do we know anything about whether that question is at the heart of her decision making or
*  does she not care about that at all?
*  I think it's hard to totally know.
*  It is a governing choice, of course, but you're not governing if you don't get elected.
*  So this is at its core, above all, a political choice.
*  So if you were Harris and you have the opportunity to help yourself win Pennsylvania or Arizona,
*  it's hard to see that you would just quickly give that up.
*  Mm hmm. It feels like there's a potential X factor in this decision that might be guiding
*  Vice President Harris's decision that I want to run by you as we conclude this conversation.
*  And that's the reality that Harris is a sitting vice president.
*  She knows the office of the vice presidency, knows its possibilities and all its frustrating
*  limitations. And that, I have to expect, might have a very strong.
*  Effect on how she makes this decision and perhaps might even outweigh a lot of the other
*  factors we're talking about here around strategy.
*  I mean, like you said, yes, you have to win in order to govern, but she especially understands
*  the governing side of this job.
*  Right. She's clearly dealing with a checklist here that's really hard for anyone who has
*  not been in the position of vice president to understand.
*  And based on this crazy experience that just happened to her, where she suddenly became
*  at the top of the ticket, she knows that you need someone who's not only going to be
*  ready on day one to take over the job if a catastrophe ensues, but also someone that
*  she's going to have to live with for four or even eight years.
*  She's going to work closely with the president and vice president is a very can be a
*  very difficult or very intimate relationship.
*  We've seen both models and there are people on this list that she knows better than
*  others. Two of them, she served as a state attorney general alongside Josh Shapiro
*  and Andy Beshear. They were both attorney generals at the same time as she was.
*  But she also knows something else based on how her life has changed over the past two
*  weeks. And she knows that effectively she will be picking the person who when her time
*  in the political stage ends, whether that's in November or that's in four years or that's
*  in eight years, she is effectively anointing her successor.
*  She is picking the person that Democrats will look to as the next in line and as the
*  person who will carry on the mantle of whatever her political career becomes.
*  Right. And she has to decide all of that in basically 10 days.
*  Yeah, you know, no big deal.
*  Just make the biggest political decision of your career, the future of your party,
*  potentially the country in 10 days.
*  Just knock it out on your to do list.
*  Pick running mate. Check.
*  Well, Lisa, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it. Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  I have great respect for our institutions and the separation of powers laid out in our
*  Constitution. But what's happening now is not consistent with that doctrine.
*  During a speech on Monday in Texas, President Biden unveiled a plan to bring sweeping
*  changes to the U.S. Supreme Court.
*  They include creating an enforceable code of ethics and creating 18 year term limits
*  for justices.
*  Extremism is undermining the public confidence in the court's decisions.
*  The plan has little chance of becoming law, but seeks to rein in the power of a court
*  that has moved further and further to the right on everything from abortion to affirmative
*  action and shown a greater and greater willingness to disregard its own
*  precedents. And Venezuela's authoritarian leader,
*  Nicolas Maduro, has declared victory in his reelection bid despite accusations of
*  widespread fraud.
*  In response, officials in the United States and many Latin American countries denounced
*  Maduro's claim of victory and sought precinct by precinct voting data to verify the
*  results. Today's episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson, Ricky Novitski and
*  Claire Tennesgetter. It was edited by Liz O'Balin, contains original music by Marion
*  Lozano and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansford of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Mamaro.
*  See you tomorrow.
