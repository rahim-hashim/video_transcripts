# The Deserter: Parts 1-3
**New York Times - The Daily:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM)
*  This reporting was supported by the International Women's Media Foundation's Howard G. Buffett [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=0.0s)]

*  Hi, my name is Sarah Topol and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8.76s)]
*  Two and a half years ago, in the middle of the night, Russian soldiers invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=15.48s)]
*  Ukrainian military casualties are a closely guarded secret, but at least 31,000 Ukrainian [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=23.72s)]
*  soldiers have been killed since then, although that is definitely an undercount. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=29.56s)]
*  And according to British intelligence, more than half a million Russian soldiers have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=35.44s)]
*  been killed or wounded. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=40.04s)]
*  Just who are these soldiers fighting for President Vladimir Putin's ambition? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  How did they explain their involvement in this war? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=49.04s)]
*  And for the story you'll be hearing, I set out to write about the Russian military and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=53.1s)]
*  meet as many service members as I could. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=57.94s)]
*  I talked to 18 soldiers and officers who fled the war at the risk of retribution by the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=62.06s)]
*  Russian regime. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=67.18s)]
*  And what I learned was that a lot of these men had families and partners who followed [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  them into exile, into these terrifying and dangerous lives. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=73.5s)]
*  And so I found myself writing not just about Russia on the front lines, but about Russia [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=79.98s)]
*  at home. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=85.38s)]
*  And there was one person I spoke with whose story I couldn't get out of my head. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=87.86s)]
*  A man I'll call Ivan. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=92.86s)]
*  Ivan grew up in a military family. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=96.34s)]
*  He attended a military academy and became a captain in the armed forces of the Russian [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  Federation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=103.82s)]
*  It was a steady job with a decent paycheck. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=106.02s)]
*  He ended up getting promoted, and on the very night he celebrated his promotion, he also [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=110.22s)]
*  met a woman I'll call Anna. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=115.66s)]
*  Ivan and Anna fell deeply in love, got married, started a family. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=119.06s)]
*  Ivan planned to finish his military service, retire, and start his new life as a civilian. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=125.14s)]
*  But then he got sent to fight in Ukraine. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=132.34s)]
*  When I first met Ivan, we sat together for eight hours a day, for a week, as he told [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=137.94s)]
*  me his whole story. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=144.26s)]
*  About his life in Russia, what he did as a soldier, and everything he did to escape. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=147.02s)]
*  Some days after we spoke, I'd walk around for hours, just talking to myself and processing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=154.26s)]
*  what Ivan told me. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=160.3s)]
*  I kept thinking how easy it is for each of us, when we're in any conflict, to feel like [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  we're on the morally correct side of things. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=168.86s)]
*  That we're on some sort of higher ground than our adversary. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=172.26000000000002s)]
*  But what Ivan's story tells you is just how much more complicated everything really is. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  How one deliberate action or one decision leads to another, and then another, until [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  before you know it, you're in a crater getting shelled by tanks in a war whose outcome you [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=188.18s)]
*  feel you have no stake in. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=192.8s)]
*  Ivan's story is also, I think, a kind of universal love story. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=194.02s)]
*  Not just about romantic love, but about the type of love that would cause you to do all [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=201.84s)]
*  kinds of things that you wouldn't normally do, just to survive. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=206.56s)]
*  And so here now is Ivan's story, and it starts with a message, a call for help from his wife. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=213.9s)]
*  The Deserter, Part One. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=243.9s)]
*  The Ballad of Ivan and Anna. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=259.18s)]
*  September 22, 2022. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=263.18s)]
*  Subject. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=266.18s)]
*  I need help. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=267.46s)]
*  Hello. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=268.86s)]
*  My name is... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=269.94s)]
*  My husband is a member of the Russian Army. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=272.3s)]
*  He several times refused to participate in the special operation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=275.14s)]
*  He should have been fired, but he has not been fired so far. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=278.94s)]
*  We are against war. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=283.22s)]
*  We hate this mode in our country. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=285.24s)]
*  Please, help us save his life. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  He has a foreign passport, but he cannot take it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=291.1s)]
*  Please, I beg you, help. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=293.94s)]
*  Today or tomorrow he must be sent to war. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=297.54s)]
*  My number is plus seven. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=300.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=304.9s)]
*  Forgive me for writing this letter so chaotically, but I am crying and feeling absolutely hopeless. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  An email to a German refugee organization on the day the German Interior Minister announced [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=312.94s)]
*  that the country was ready to accept asylum requests from deserters from the armed forces [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=318.38s)]
*  of the Russian Federation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=322.73999999999995s)]
*  On the night Ivan met Anna, he was so drunk that he could barely remember her face the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=328.54s)]
*  next morning. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=332.62s)]
*  Only that she had the most beautiful eyes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=334.42s)]
*  Earlier that day, Ivan had been promoted to Senior Lieutenant. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=337.58000000000004s)]
*  Over a dinner banquet, officers from his unit watched as Ivan washed down, a Soviet-era [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=341.66s)]
*  ritual that continues to this day. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=347.06s)]
*  They filled a glass with four shots of vodka until it was almost overflowing and threw [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=350.22s)]
*  Ivan's newly acquired six epaulette stars in. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=354.62s)]
*  Following custom, Ivan stood up and addressed the assembled. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=358.34000000000003s)]
*  Comrade officers, warrant officers, sergeants, he began. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  He paused, downed the vodka and flipped the cup onto the table, scattering the stars. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=368.1s)]
*  I, Senior Lieutenant, present myself on the occasion of awarding me the regular military [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=373.74s)]
*  rank of Senior Lieutenant. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=380.18s)]
*  Once the newly minted officer had said everything clearly, smoothly, without a hitch, the commander [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=383.5s)]
*  of Ivan's unit continued. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  Comrade officers, warrant officers, sergeants, do we accept? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=391.7s)]
*  We accept, they called in unison. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=397.7s)]
*  They put three stars on each of Ivan's shoulders, doused them with vodka and pounded on them [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=400.34s)]
*  hard so that the pins on the bottom dug into his skin. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=404.94s)]
*  If Ivan had messed up, he would have had to drink another four shots and try again. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=409.42s)]
*  Afterward, they headed to a club. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=414.02000000000004s)]
*  In the crowd under the dim, smoke-addled light, he saw Anna. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=417.54s)]
*  She was hypnotic. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=421.82s)]
*  Anna noticed him, too. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=423.66s)]
*  Without exchanging words, they started dancing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  The crowds parted, forming a circle around them. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=428.78000000000003s)]
*  Ivan danced for hours like he had never danced before. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=431.42s)]
*  Later, he would call her Andromeda, like the goddess and the galaxy, a constellation in [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  the evening sky that shone so brightly it eclipsed all the stars. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  At the end of the night, or more like early morning, Ivan gave her his phone and told [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=446.38s)]
*  her to put in her number. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=450.9s)]
*  Anna obliged, but when she looked up, he was gone. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  She stood there, holding his phone for what felt like an eternity. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=456.46s)]
*  Another guy came up and started chatting to her. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=460.29999999999995s)]
*  Buddy, you're too late, Ivan proclaimed from behind them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=463.02s)]
*  She peered over and saw him covered in sweat, holding a huge bouquet of lilies. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=466.94s)]
*  He had sprinted to a 24-hour flower shop nearby. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=471.3s)]
*  Anna was in town from St. Petersburg as the maid of honor at a wedding. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=476.02s)]
*  At the ceremony earlier that day, she caught the bouquet. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=480.5s)]
*  By the end of the week, Anna would be returning to her university hundreds of miles away. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=484.18s)]
*  Ivan would leave for a month-long assignment around the islands of the Pacific, a routine [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=489.42s)]
*  expedition to observe an eavesdrop on U.S. Allied training there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=493.7s)]
*  Later, both would agree it had been fate. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=498.54s)]
*  The Russian ship was a simple surveillance vessel with radio equipment that looked as [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=505.78s)]
*  if it was from before Ivan's grandfather was born. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=510.18s)]
*  Ivan had just bought his first camera, and for a month he took photos of the clouds, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=513.98s)]
*  low and heavy over the waves. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=518.7s)]
*  He imagined all the things he would tell Anna when he next got the chance. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=521.22s)]
*  How when you first go out on a ship, you have to participate in a ceremony befriending Neptune, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=525.26s)]
*  in which the new sailors, nearly naked, drink sea water out of a glass and get rubbed with ash. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=530.5s)]
*  How they fished for squid, dove right off the ship into the warm waters, a few guys [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=536.4200000000001s)]
*  standing watch with machine guns in case of sharks, while the sunsets streaked the sky [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=541.34s)]
*  with cotton candy pink and crimson red. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=546.1s)]
*  Ivan spent hours on the deck looking for a cell phone signal. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=550.22s)]
*  When he found one, he ordered Anna flowers, sent her sushi rolls through friends, and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=554.0600000000001s)]
*  plotted a trip to St. Petersburg to surprise her. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=558.5s)]
*  For her part, Anna sleepwalked through her classes, re-reading all his texts. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=562.3000000000001s)]
*  She marveled at his descriptions of the Philippine Sea, the color of the water. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=567.6s)]
*  He was sure she had never seen a shade as blue as what he described. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=572.18s)]
*  One day, not far from port, Ivan's boat passed 50 meters from an American aircraft carrier [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=576.66s)]
*  that looked straight out of Hollywood. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=582.06s)]
*  Most of the soldiers had never seen a ship so big. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=584.78s)]
*  The carrier's hatches were open, interior compartments visible with airplanes and all [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=587.8199999999999s)]
*  kinds of equipment inside. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=593.02s)]
*  The Russians in flip-flops and swim trunks or underwear ran out to sea. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=595.5s)]
*  The Americans stood on the deck in blue uniforms with white helmets and gloves, their ship [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=600.16s)]
*  glistening in the sun. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=605.18s)]
*  Everyone waved. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=607.28s)]
*  Ivan grew up on the outskirts of nowhere, in an unremarkable mid-sized city near a military [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=610.04s)]
*  base. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  His family considered themselves patriotic. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=616.4599999999999s)]
*  Though they didn't talk much about politics, Ivan was taught that he lived in a righteous [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=618.64s)]
*  country. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=624.0s)]
*  Nearly every Soviet family had lost a man to the front in World War II, in what Russians [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=625.24s)]
*  call the Great Patriotic War. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=629.96s)]
*  And both Ivan and Anna grew up on stories of sacrifice. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=632.76s)]
*  Ivan's father served as had his father before him. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=636.88s)]
*  As a child of the perestroika experiment, Ivan watched Russia sink into a decade of [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=641.34s)]
*  banditry, political tussles and get-rich-quick schemes. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=646.48s)]
*  While he and his friends played with little green soldiers in the courtyard, their parents [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  struggled with the basics. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=654.6s)]
*  Electricity. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=656.32s)]
*  Food. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=657.32s)]
*  Water. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=658.32s)]
*  Heat. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=659.32s)]
*  Ivan's mother and father didn't make much, but they could count on housing and a small [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=660.32s)]
*  government-backed paycheck. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=664.32s)]
*  Though after the Russian Federation was established in 1991, often even that didn't come. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=665.88s)]
*  Every month the family drove two hours to a larger city with a wholesale market, walking [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=673.0s)]
*  through piles of plush toys, clothes, kitchen supplies, and everything in between. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=678.0s)]
*  Ivan, like everyone else, stood on a piece of cardboard while the vendor held a curtain [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=684.2s)]
*  around him as he tried on clothes. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=688.34s)]
*  Whether it was very cold or snowing or raining, Ivan would remove his pants and stand in his [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=691.24s)]
*  underwear, too poor to try on clothes in warm changing rooms at shops. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  This phrase, dressed on cardboard, is still used to describe a generation of Russians [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=701.48s)]
*  who lived through the poverty of the 90s. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=707.08s)]
*  Ivan was in secondary school when Vladimir Putin rose to power at the turn of the century [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=710.86s)]
*  and began to establish his system of control, promoting from his inner circle while crushing [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=715.3s)]
*  oligarchs and cracking down on newly gained freedoms. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=720.86s)]
*  Still, in this new Russia, money was everything. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=724.78s)]
*  Though Ivan's family had stability, they had nothing on his girlfriend's parents. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=728.22s)]
*  When he opened their refrigerator, there was so much juice, J7, the kind with pulp that [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=733.86s)]
*  his parents never bought. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=739.22s)]
*  Her father was a businessman, and though Ivan wasn't sure what exactly that entailed, he [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=741.46s)]
*  wanted to be one, too. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=746.46s)]
*  But the year before Ivan graduated from secondary school, he spent a week with a family friend's [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=749.02s)]
*  son who spun him a tale of adventure in the Special Forces, where young men went on training [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=753.82s)]
*  missions for days with just their bare hands to sustain them, living in the wild with a [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=759.34s)]
*  compass and a set of instructions. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=764.5400000000001s)]
*  In wartime, they would sneak behind enemy lines to help lead the rest of the troops [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=767.5s)]
*  to victory safely, protecting their own in defense of their homeland. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=771.46s)]
*  Ivan had always been a sucker for romance, for a world where the villains and the heroes [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=777.58s)]
*  were clear. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=782.3s)]
*  There were rules in the military games Ivan played as a child. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=783.3s)]
*  Under no circumstances could anyone attack a hospital, and that's the kind of world [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=787.54s)]
*  Ivan liked, where things were black and white and every problem had a solution. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=792.34s)]
*  Ivan got into one of the most competitive Russian military academies. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=799.4200000000001s)]
*  It wasn't that he dreamed of going to war, he just thought it wouldn't happen. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=803.7s)]
*  Becoming an officer was a fine path for a kid from nowhere. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=808.62s)]
*  A degree, free health care, a pension, and a guaranteed apartment upon retirement, not [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=812.0600000000001s)]
*  that Ivan was thinking that far ahead. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=817.5s)]
*  He was spellbound by the promise of adventure. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=820.14s)]
*  At the academy, cadets lived in barracks with metal bunk beds in neat rows. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=824.5s)]
*  In the corner there were mats and a punching bag. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=828.66s)]
*  The shower was cold water from a hose connected to the tap. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=832.18s)]
*  Ivan loved it immediately. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=836.14s)]
*  Angles were perpendicular, beds were made and everything ended with one word, понятна, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=838.66s)]
*  understood? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=844.7s)]
*  The young men skied in the back country, learned terrain navigation and hand-to-hand [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=846.18s)]
*  combat, figured out how much TNT would blow a railway and how much would blow a bridge. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=850.8599999999999s)]
*  They studied languages and built up their physical endurance. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=856.66s)]
*  But upon graduation Ivan faced the perennial problem of the Russian military, its bloated [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=860.9399999999999s)]
*  officer corps. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=866.3399999999999s)]
*  Ivan was a lieutenant doing reconnaissance duty, a position far from his specialization, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=868.54s)]
*  the elite unit he trained for. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=874.14s)]
*  His shifts were 24 hours on, 24 hours off, drafting training and duty schedules that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=876.98s)]
*  no one looked at and heating up his food in the microwave. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=883.22s)]
*  He tried to complain to his superiors. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=887.34s)]
*  The state had paid for his education and then assigned him here. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=889.66s)]
*  There was no opportunity to do what he trained for, no chance to put what he learned to the [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=893.18s)]
*  test. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=898.1s)]
*  Worse, no one cared. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=899.1s)]
*  Ivan couldn't just leave the service. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=902.5s)]
*  If he were to break his contract he would have to pay back the state for his education, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=904.7s)]
*  lose his benefits and have a mark on his record. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=908.94s)]
*  It's not as if he knew how to do anything else anyway. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=912.28s)]
*  When he looked at the civilian sector for job opportunities with his language skills, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=915.46s)]
*  he saw ads that said, military cadet graduates need not apply. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=919.78s)]
*  Ivan decided to write it out. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=924.96s)]
*  But the lack of good billets made life boring and difficult. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=926.98s)]
*  He tried to distract himself, applying to different remote rotations. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=930.62s)]
*  At least he could try to make life more interesting. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=934.62s)]
*  After he started dating Anna, Ivan found that he began to think more critically. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=938.54s)]
*  It wasn't just that she pressed him to be more thoughtful about their relationship. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=942.46s)]
*  She challenged him to think about a lot of things he had taken for granted before. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=947.0600000000001s)]
*  The contrasts didn't hit him all at once, but more slowly. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=951.7s)]
*  An accumulation of incongruities that built up over time. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=956.02s)]
*  Ivan told her about another work trip when he had been sent to the 2,600 mile long border [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=960.9399999999999s)]
*  with China. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=965.66s)]
*  On top of a reconnaissance station he could see both sides of the boundary clearly. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=967.3s)]
*  On the Russian side he saw a dilapidated village, not even a town, just a village, with broken [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=972.34s)]
*  roads and half-trunk passers-by. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=977.62s)]
*  On the other side, Las Vegas. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=980.56s)]
*  High-rise buildings, neon lights, wind turbines. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=983.3199999999999s)]
*  It looks like the difference between heaven and earth, he thought. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=987.4799999999999s)]
*  At the time, Ivan and his comrades had asked one another, why couldn't their country do [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  anything like that? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=995.5999999999999s)]
*  It's bad, the young men agreed. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=997.56s)]
*  But like most Russians, they did nothing but remark on it, without the expectation that [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=999.78s)]
*  it would change. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1004.3s)]
*  Apathy is a skill that requires practice over time. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1006.08s)]
*  Ivan had never considered himself a big talker. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1012.2s)]
*  But Anna had a lot of things to say. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1015.32s)]
*  She had been struck by the economic boom that followed the poverty of their childhood. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1017.76s)]
*  The future and its possibilities had been dazzling. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1022.32s)]
*  She had done everything she could to get out of her own childhood nowhere and to St. Petersburg. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1025.78s)]
*  A city of white nights, deep winters, and big dreams. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1031.32s)]
*  She cared about art, theater, music, literature, international relations, lofty college conversations [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1035.28s)]
*  in big city bars. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1041.98s)]
*  Before she met Ivan, Anna received a scholarship to go to America on a study abroad program. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1044.94s)]
*  And she realized that the world was much larger than anything she had been told about in school. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1050.18s)]
*  That a person is bigger than where she was born or what language she spoke. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1055.28s)]
*  These limits, boundaries, they don't even exist, she told Ivan when they were falling [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1060.1s)]
*  in love, you make these frames yourself. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1064.38s)]
*  Theirs was a big wedding. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1069.22s)]
*  Both Anna and Ivan had wanted to keep it small and simple. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1071.0800000000002s)]
*  To do something at a cafe, nothing pompous. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1074.3000000000002s)]
*  But one thing led to another and all their relatives came. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1077.5400000000002s)]
*  Anna carried a large bouquet accented with yellow tulips, her favorite flower. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1081.46s)]
*  He wore his officer uniform. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1086.9s)]
*  She wore a white trumpet dress that swayed at her ankles. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1088.8600000000001s)]
*  Her long veil studded with glittering gemstones. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1092.58s)]
*  Ivan was solemn during their vows, his eyes beaming. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1096.6599999999999s)]
*  Anna cried straight through the whole thing. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1100.1799999999998s)]
*  After they married, Anna left St. Petersburg and joined Ivan at his base. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1103.84s)]
*  She had never spent much time thinking about the military before she met him. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1108.4199999999998s)]
*  Soldiers were just people who wore green uniforms and stood at attention on parade grounds a [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1112.8999999999999s)]
*  few times a day. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1116.98s)]
*  Ivan left in the morning, came home for lunch, left again, and was home for a late dinner. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1119.56s)]
*  It looked like a regular civilian job, except everyone cursed all the time. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1125.16s)]
*  Like most Russians, Anna and Ivan saw politics as something dirty, something better avoided. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1130.7s)]
*  It was best to focus on things you could actually control. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1136.8s)]
*  And so neither of them had paid much attention to Putin's political maneuvering or his engineering [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1140.08s)]

*  They lived in a tiny studio apartment that they renovated themselves. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1151.56s)]
*  They had few luxuries, but they were happy. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1155.4399999999998s)]
*  They wrote each other poetry, danced together, sang together, and even wrote a book just [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1158.24s)]
*  for the two of them so they wouldn't forget. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1162.48s)]
*  They started planning for a baby. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1165.02s)]
*  When she was young, Anna kept a diary. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1168.4199999999998s)]
*  On page after page, she begged the world to give her true love. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1171.12s)]
*  She loved Ivan with a kind of mystical force, and she wanted to have a family. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1175.26s)]
*  She worried that his talents were wasted in the army. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1180.26s)]
*  He was smart, greedy for life at his core. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1183.08s)]
*  But the man she had fallen for had chosen this road, so she took it too. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1186.32s)]
*  Ivan's disappointment with the realities of service were bearable until he got a new [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1191.62s)]
*  commander. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1198.06s)]
*  His subordinates nicknamed him Pig for his jowls and ruddy cheeks. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1199.06s)]
*  Pig started pocketing the rations earmarked for field training, which the guys were able [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1203.94s)]
*  to sell if they brought their own food from home. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1208.22s)]
*  Ivan was owed three days' worth after a weekend in the field, so he went to demand them. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1211.88s)]
*  If they didn't put an end to this now, who knows what would happen? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1217.18s)]
*  First it's rations, Ivan said, then it's our wages. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1220.7800000000002s)]
*  His colleagues told him not to bother. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1224.22s)]
*  Everyone knew Pig had plenty of schemes. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1226.64s)]
*  The confrontation went nowhere, and instead the commander started singling Ivan out, writing [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1229.98s)]
*  him up for minor infractions that everyone committed, like carrying a cell phone around [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1235.6200000000001s)]
*  the base to get him demoted. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1239.9s)]
*  When Ivan went to the military prosecutor's office to fight his demotion, he was told [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1243.4s)]
*  he would win a case against Pig in court, but he lost. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1247.74s)]
*  Of course, Pig had a cretia, a roof. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1251.38s)]
*  How is this happening, Ivan would ask. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1254.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm told I'm right, so why am I being punished? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1258.18s)]
*  Did I steal the rations? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1261.3s)]
*  No, those are my rations. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1262.6200000000001s)]
*  He stole them from me, and I'm wrong? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1264.6000000000001s)]
*  Graft was endemic in the Russian military, permeating every level from the top brass [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1268.8200000000002s)]
*  to the grunts. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1273.3200000000002s)]
*  The scale is astounding, said Sergei Fridinsky, one of Russia's chief military prosecutors. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1275.04s)]
*  Sometimes it seems that people have simply lost their sense of moderation and conscience. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1281.6200000000001s)]
*  It was hard to root out, even if someone wanted to. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1286.7s)]
*  It was less about criminality and more a mentality. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1290.1000000000001s)]
*  The thinking was simple. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1293.98s)]
*  It's one thing to serve the motherland, but you can't forget about yourself. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1295.8600000000001s)]
*  Pig was among the many commanders who stole state-subsidized fuel from the military and [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1301.22s)]
*  sold it on the side at the civilian market price. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1306.22s)]
*  There were a number of methods for doing this, blatantly filling a commercial truck at a [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1308.94s)]
*  gas station, filling a military transport, siphoning fuel from its tank to other carriers, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1314.18s)]
*  and then adding fake kilometers to trucks to explain the difference on the accounting [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1320.46s)]
*  end. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1324.42s)]
*  Pig was also ordering his subordinates to saw wood from the base's firing range so [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1325.72s)]
*  he could sell it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1329.94s)]
*  Everyone did it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1331.74s)]
*  Russia's turn of the century prosperity had tapered off with the 2008 financial crisis [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1333.78s)]
*  and falling oil revenue. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1338.54s)]
*  Though the government's official statistics suggest that poverty hovers around 10 percent, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1341.06s)]
*  an investigation by the Russian outlet The Insider shows that the reality is much worse. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1345.78s)]
*  Roughly half of Russian families in many regions live below the poverty line. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1351.74s)]
*  Outside the major cities, more than 10 million people do not have gas in their houses. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1357.26s)]
*  They collect wood for heating. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1362.02s)]
*  Many families still do not have indoor toilets. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1364.34s)]
*  They defecate and hold in the ground. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1367.06s)]
*  There had been plenty of idiocy that Ivan overlooked in his service. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1370.52s)]
*  Literally hours of watching troops paint the grass green, ripping dandelions with his bare [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1374.62s)]
*  hands plowing and re-plowing snow banks for no discernible reason, standing at attention [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1379.3799999999999s)]
*  for hours in the freezing cold on the parade grounds. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1385.1999999999998s)]
*  Then there were larger frustrations, like the fact that they were promised weekends [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1389.1599999999999s)]
*  and overtime but never got them. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1392.84s)]
*  Every repair at the base, painting the barracks, fixing broken stairs, was made using money [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1395.6399999999999s)]
*  the officers and the soldiers had to throw together, though they were making next to [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  nothing themselves. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1404.4399999999998s)]
*  According to the RAND Corporation in 2008, around 30 percent of officers holding the [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1407.08s)]
*  rank of major and below were earning wages at or under the poverty line. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1411.76s)]
*  Soldiers were asked to donate for repairs, but everyone knew there was no answer outside [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1417.8s)]
*  of, yes, comrade. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1422.82s)]
*  As a result, men like Ivan sold military fuel or bartered parts to make base repairs. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1425.1s)]
*  Few civilians realized that each commander in the Russian military was actually a fiscal [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1431.9199999999998s)]
*  hostage. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1436.28s)]
*  When an officer assumed his position, he signed off on responsibility for all his unit's equipment, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1437.28s)]
*  much of which had been sold or bartered by the previous commander and so was never actually [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1443.56s)]
*  there. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1447.66s)]
*  This made it impossible to abdicate his job, because it would look as though he stole the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1449.1000000000001s)]
*  equipment and he would have to use his own money to replace it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1453.3400000000001s)]
*  The equipment that was there was outdated and broke frequently. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1457.74s)]
*  Not because someone did something wrong, but because the parts were old and unserviceable, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1461.98s)]
*  or because the repair unit didn't feel like coming out. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1466.66s)]
*  Still, the officer would be blamed for not monitoring the equipment well and penalized. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1469.5400000000002s)]
*  So instead of reporting the break, the officer would sell some of the military's fuel to [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1475.66s)]
*  repair the machinery. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1479.6200000000001s)]
*  Was that really stealing or was that simply the job? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1481.78s)]
*  After his demotion, Ivan stalked around the base trying to foment a rebellion. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1486.44s)]
*  He wanted to file a collective complaint against Pig to the military prosecutor, but none of [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1491.22s)]
*  the other soldiers would go on the record with him. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1495.74s)]
*  The main thing is that when they discuss something in the back rooms, everyone is like, yes, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1498.78s)]
*  yes, let's do it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1503.02s)]
*  But when I come up and say, let's take action, everybody says, oh, come on, why? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1504.3799999999999s)]
*  He would rage to Anna. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1508.86s)]
*  Because everybody realizes that the same thing that happened to me is just going to happen [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1510.86s)]
*  to them. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1514.98s)]
*  They're just going to be removed from their position on some flimsy excuse. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1515.98s)]
*  Everybody's got debt. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1521.26s)]
*  Everybody's got families and no one needs it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1522.9s)]
*  Anna didn't understand why it was this fight over stolen rations and his litany of complaints [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1526.26s)]
*  that broke him. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1531.18s)]
*  He could be so categorical, so rigid. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1532.94s)]
*  She supported his decisions, but she didn't understand why he needed this. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1536.46s)]
*  She told him to be careful. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1541.1000000000001s)]
*  He was in the system and he had two choices. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1543.18s)]
*  You either play by the rules or get out, she told him. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1546.0600000000002s)]
*  If you go against your superiors, you risk everything. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1548.94s)]
*  Was that really something he wanted to do? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1552.98s)]
*  At night in their tiny apartment, they sat at the kitchen table as he tried to explain [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1556.3400000000001s)]
*  it to her. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1559.98s)]
*  The Russian military had promised him better, a better billet, a better life and some kind [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1561.46s)]
*  of purpose. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1566.9s)]
*  And now after he watched them steal so much, they were ruining his reputation. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1567.9s)]
*  How much more could one man take? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1573.9s)]
*  What kind of military was this? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1577.14s)]
*  The roots of the dysfunction could be traced back to the army of Ivan's forefathers. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1583.02s)]
*  During the Cold War, the Soviet Union built one of the largest standing armies in the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1588.26s)]
*  world, twice the size of the U.S. military. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1591.98s)]
*  More than four million troops were organized to repel a large land invasion, a blundering [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1595.9s)]
*  force with a huge officer corps that relied on young men serving two years of mandatory [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1601.66s)]
*  conscription service for the bulk of its manpower. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1606.94s)]
*  For the Soviets, national service was both political and practical. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1610.7s)]
*  Homeland defense strategy for decades hinged on overwhelming the enemy with vast reserves [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1615.42s)]

*  The Russian army's development from the disarray of the Soviet Union was as impressive as it [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1622.98s)]

*  The Russian Federation inherited most of the Red Army's personnel and equipment, but also [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1632.46s)]
*  its baggage. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1637.26s)]

*  Should Moscow retain a vast army organized around fighting existential battles with the [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1654.3000000000002s)]

*  There was no money to feed or house the Russian troops, much less to professionalize them. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1676.82s)]
*  Left to their own devices, units turned fields into farms and foraged for mushrooms in the [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1682.5s)]

*  Waves of ill-prepared conscripts and young officers were sent into urban combat with [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1770.2600000000002s)]
*  guerrilla fighters, suffering heavy casualties while perpetrating gross human rights abuses, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1774.5400000000002s)]

*  in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1812.18s)]
*  During Putin's first two terms in office, oil and gas prices started rising, so the [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1815.74s)]
*  government finally had money to spend on military reform. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1820.7s)]
*  In 2001, Putin appointed Sergey Ivanov, a former official in the KGB and its successor agency [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1824.54s)]
*  the FSB, to the post of defense minister. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1831.54s)]
*  Ivanov pushed for shortening mandatory national service to 12 months and for greater reliance [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1835.3799999999999s)]
*  on enlisted soldiers, contractniki rather than conscripts, to professionalize the service. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1840.6599999999999s)]
*  But recalcitrants among the top brass continued to thwart meaningful change. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1846.8999999999999s)]
*  Moscow's early attempts at rapprochement with the West were nearing their finale. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1852.46s)]
*  In 2003, the Russian Defense Ministry issued a white paper that emphasized that the United [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1857.02s)]
*  States was again the country's main security threat. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1862.28s)]
*  The military budget increased fourfold. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1865.6s)]
*  Corruption continued. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  If earlier military fraud revolved around theft and the sale of state assets, it took [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1870.2s)]
*  on a different dimension under Putin, direct embezzlement of the budget. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1875.12s)]
*  In August 2008, while Ivan was on summer vacation from the Academy, Russia invaded Georgia, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1880.48s)]
*  ostensibly to stop Tbilisi from asserting control over the breakaway regions Abkhazia [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1886.9199999999998s)]
*  and South Ossetia, but more to prevent Georgia from joining NATO. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1891.28s)]
*  Though the operation succeeded politically, the Russian military's performance was pathetic. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1896.6s)]
*  There was horrible coordination between branches, poorly executed flight missions, malfunctioning [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1901.92s)]
*  equipment and deaths from friendly fire. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1907.32s)]
*  Russia had not held a combat training exercise for about a decade. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1910.6399999999999s)]
*  The embarrassment provided the defense minister, Anatoly Serdyukhov, an opportunity to push [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1914.72s)]
*  through New Look, a major reform campaign designed to make the military a leaner, more [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1919.96s)]
*  professional force by upgrading equipment, cleaning up the corruption, and reducing the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1925.28s)]
*  numbers of officers and conscripts. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1930.04s)]
*  Ivan would experience the reform's unintended consequences. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1933.6s)]
*  Hireings froze, promotions ceased, and officer academies paused new enrollment. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1937.72s)]
*  With no one coming up the ladder to relieve them, officers like Ivan remained stuck in [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1943.48s)]
*  lower ranks, forced to juggle multiple roles. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1947.78s)]
*  At the same time, politicians talked while the top brass stole, and all Ivan was left [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1952.42s)]
*  with was mindless paperwork and now character assassination. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1957.5s)]
*  None of the corruption was cleaned up. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1962.82s)]
*  Sergei Shoigu, whom Putin appointed as defense minister in 2012, did nothing to change this. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1966.14s)]
*  The military increased large-scale strategic exercises, but these functioned more like [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1972.86s)]
*  choreographed performances. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1977.6599999999999s)]
*  Appearances outweighed reality. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1980.1799999999998s)]
*  The most glaring example of this was the emphasis on metrics, verified by the photo report. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1982.78s)]
*  Activities had to be photographed for documentation. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1989.34s)]
*  That meant that a commanding officer was supposed to not only do his job, run an exercise, say, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1991.86s)]
*  but also produce a photo report about it to send to his commander the same day. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=1996.76s)]
*  The requirement covered everything from trainings to storehouse checks. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2001.52s)]
*  There was no task more universally derided. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2005.6s)]
*  The Soviet-era adage, we pretend to work and they pretend to pay us, was reborn for the [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2008.96s)]
*  digital age. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2014.24s)]
*  One former service member I spoke to, Alexei Olshansky, who was a warrant officer responsible [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2016.32s)]
*  for the training grounds of the 4th Guards Tank Division of the Western Military District, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2021.26s)]
*  used Photoshop to repaint old-spotted camouflage uniforms into new, Shoigu-favored Ratnik pixels [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2026.44s)]
*  so that his unit could recycle old photo reports. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2033.96s)]
*  I swear I'm not joking, he told me, laughing, about the proliferation of the practice. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2036.76s)]
*  I've even seen photo reports verifying the making of photo reports. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2042.3200000000002s)]
*  As the slideshows went further and further up the district ladder, Russia appeared to [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2047.72s)]
*  have the most fearsome army on Earth. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2052.08s)]
*  But at the ground level, everyone despised the requirement. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2054.9599999999996s)]
*  For commanders, it doubled the workload. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2058.8399999999997s)]
*  For grunts, it meant an absurd amount of time wasted standing around posing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2061.6s)]
*  Many ignored the trainings themselves and just did the photo report. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2067.3199999999997s)]
*  There was no time for both, even for those commanders who actually wanted to work. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2071.0s)]
*  The outcome verged on cartoonish. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2076.9199999999996s)]
*  Typically, one man was chosen and photographed. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2079.3599999999997s)]
*  He was sweeping the barracks, doing the dusting, cleaning the bathrooms, fixing the piping [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2082.74s)]
*  and raking the lawn. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2087.06s)]
*  Everyone knew it was bogus. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2088.8599999999997s)]
*  What kind of one-man company were they running? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2090.4599999999996s)]
*  What a great guy who could do everything in two hours. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2093.22s)]
*  Photographs of warehouse stores were taken from below, so it looked as if all the shelves [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2097.2599999999998s)]
*  were full when only the bottom one was. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2101.18s)]

*  of command. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2117.82s)]
*  Ivan managed to transfer to a hardship posting, where his service counted double toward his [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2122.66s)]
*  retirement. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2127.42s)]

*  The new base was even more grim than the last. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2134.86s)]

*  Tumbleweeds, fields, deserts, broken swings. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2141.02s)]
*  The town was pathetic. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2145.34s)]
*  Zero infrastructure, two rundown bars. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2147.06s)]
*  Ivan and Anna lived on the main street. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2150.86s)]
*  From their second-floor apartment, they could see the skatepark downstairs. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2153.26s)]
*  Next door there was an open field. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2157.3s)]
*  In the winter it was a hockey rink, in the summer a soccer field. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2158.6600000000003s)]

*  Sasha had been born a week late. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2169.58s)]

*  He wanted everything to be perfect, including himself. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2183.7s)]
*  He put the crib together and set up the nursery while Anna was in the hospital. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2187.22s)]
*  He held her hand through her two-day labor, barely leaving her side. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2191.5s)]
*  At work, Ivan spent his days shifting papers. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2196.14s)]
*  He would submit a spreadsheet about drivers, surname, first name, patronymic, license [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2199.42s)]

*  He would enter the data and send in the spreadsheet. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2209.46s)]
*  But a week later the columns changed places and he was told to submit it again. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2212.26s)]
*  I submitted it last week, didn't I? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2217.06s)]
*  Submit it again. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2219.74s)]
*  A week later, the same thing. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2221.14s)]
*  That was just one piece of paper from one division commander. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2223.4599999999996s)]
*  Multiplied by all the other chiefs, there were a billion pieces of paper. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2226.9799999999996s)]
*  There were also endless loops of morning, afternoon and evening roll call assemblies [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2232.58s)]
*  on the parade grounds. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2236.62s)]

*  After those meetings, Ivan would be assigned more paperwork that he needed to submit in [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2260.58s)]
*  the morning so that his commander could go to the internal formation and the base commander [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2264.66s)]
*  could say to him, did you do your job? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2269.18s)]
*  And he could say yes. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2271.94s)]
*  No one cared that they ended up sitting in their offices until 10 p.m. working on filling [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2274.1s)]
*  out useless columns. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2278.62s)]
*  If anyone asked for the overtime they were entitled to, the commander would say, what, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2280.74s)]
*  you overworked? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2285.62s)]

*  Reprimand. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2290.38s)]
*  For an officer, that reprimand was 6,000 to 7,000 rubles or 65 to $75. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2291.7799999999997s)]
*  No one wanted to pay that kind of money, so no one said anything. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2298.14s)]
*  Still, some of the new look reforms appeared to be working and the Kremlin started to actively [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2302.38s)]

*  In 2014, Ivan had watched on TV as Moscow took advantage of Ukraine's domestic unrest [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2312.02s)]
*  and internal divisions to annex Crimea. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2318.7000000000003s)]

*  Their discipline and professionalism were obvious. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2329.54s)]
*  No Russian lives were lost. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2332.26s)]
*  Though Europe and America responded with sanctions and sanctimony, the Kremlin was [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2334.46s)]
*  able to thwart Ukraine's aspirations for ascension to the European Union and forced the West [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2338.58s)]
*  to acknowledge Russia's opinion on geopolitical affairs. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2343.98s)]
*  The operation's success produced a wave of patriotism. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2348.52s)]
*  Most everyone in Russia, including Ivan, believed that Crimea was theirs, that it had only been [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2352.7400000000002s)]
*  given to Ukraine by a drunken Khrushchev. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2357.9s)]
*  It was a good way to get people to forget about their outhouses. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2361.14s)]
*  Even opposition politicians like Alexei Navalny did not oppose the move. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2364.66s)]
*  When unrest roiled eastern Donbas in 2014, the state-run media told Ivan that the Ukrainian [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2369.14s)]
*  province wanted to secede but that Kiev wasn't letting it. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2375.42s)]
*  Russia needs to help the ethnic Russians there, it intoned. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2379.9s)]
*  The Kremlin sent in unmarked troops to support the separatists, but Ivan and Anna's TV showed [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2383.46s)]
*  them none of that. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2389.06s)]
*  To them, in the distant reaches of their base, it all felt so far away. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2390.58s)]
*  Across Russia, militarism was rising. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2396.7s)]
*  After successes in Crimea and Donbas, Russian forces deployed to Syria in 2015 to help Moscow's [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2399.44s)]

*  There the military reforms again appeared to bear fruit, demonstrating that the Russians [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2410.46s)]
*  were capable of small, quick operations and showing off the country's new weapons. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2415.34s)]
*  Strike fighters and ship-based cruise missiles fired from more than 900 miles away in the [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2420.6200000000003s)]

*  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russians had felt their geopolitical influence wane. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2436.26s)]
*  As former Soviet republics elected pro-Western governments and chose to join NATO, Putin's [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2441.94s)]
*  early attempts to partner with the West ended in rebuke and shame. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2447.34s)]

*  Word had spread that most Russian soldiers did barely anything there. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2472.96s)]
*  Most of the actual ground combat was done by Wagner, a paramilitary group that first [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2477.1200000000003s)]

*  They would move to a new city and start a whole new kind of life. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2680.22s)]
*  In February 2022, Ivan registered for a retraining course that would start in September. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2685.34s)]
*  His commanding officer signed off. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2691.6000000000004s)]
*  All he and Anna had to do was wait and follow the plan. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2693.94s)]
*  But as Ivan would later say, Vladimir Vladimirovich decided this was a bad plan. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2697.6200000000003s)]
*  He had a better one. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2703.1200000000003s)]
*  Part Two. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2715.3s)]
*  A Change of Plans [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2721.02s)]
*  On February 24th, news broke that Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2724.0600000000004s)]
*  Though everyone said they couldn't believe it, almost 200,000 Russian service members [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2728.5s)]
*  had been stationed at the border with Ukraine for weeks. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2732.9s)]
*  The troops had been told it was just an exercise. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2736.48s)]
*  But for some reason they had been handed weapons, medical kits, and gear. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2739.6200000000003s)]
*  Around 4 a.m. local time, they began to roll across the border. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2744.32s)]
*  The U.S. government estimated that Ukraine would be overrun within days. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2748.52s)]
*  When Ivan lined up in formation for assembly, the news was everywhere. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2754.36s)]
*  But the commander made the announcement anyway. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2758.56s)]
*  We have launched an operation to denazify and demilitarize Ukraine. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2761.52s)]
*  On base, the reaction was muted. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2766.5800000000004s)]
*  Things continued as if nothing had changed. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2769.32s)]
*  The same morning, afternoon, and evening formations. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2772.48s)]
*  The same unit commander meetings at headquarters with the colonel. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2775.7200000000003s)]
*  The same photo-report minutia paperwork B.S. routine. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2779.52s)]
*  Perhaps it will all be over in three days anyway. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2783.7200000000003s)]
*  Just like Crimea, they told one another. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2786.84s)]
*  But very quickly it was clear that things weren't going the Kremlin's way. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2790.04s)]
*  The second-strongest military in the world was failing to capture and hold territory. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2794.02s)]
*  Russian troops were stalled on highways, unable to occupy major cities, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2799.36s)]
*  and losing equipment to Ukrainian farmers on tractors. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2803.6800000000003s)]
*  Anna joined a wave of liberal Russians expressing outrage at the invasion on social media. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2807.6400000000003s)]
*  A few hours after she posted a story on Instagram, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2813.4s)]
*  her supervisor called her and demanded that she take it down. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2816.2400000000002s)]
*  Did she want to get her entire office in trouble? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2820.0s)]
*  Did Anna not care about her own family at all? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2823.08s)]
*  She agreed to remove it. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2826.4s)]
*  They had been living in Putin's Russia for more than two decades now. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2828.36s)]
*  They knew that their opinions didn't really matter, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2831.96s)]
*  nor could they say them aloud even if they had them. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2834.6800000000003s)]
*  Mass political gatherings of any kind had been effectively banned for almost a decade. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2838.44s)]
*  By 2022, solo pickets were the only allowed form of political expression. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2843.4s)]
*  In major cities, thousands of people took to the streets anyway. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2849.44s)]
*  Many were picked up in police wagons and given 15 days of administrative arrest. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2853.4s)]
*  In the first two weeks after the invasion, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2859.28s)]
*  more than 13,000 protesters across the country were detained. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2861.48s)]
*  Still, many Russians did what they do best. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2865.84s)]
*  They tried not to pay attention. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2869.12s)]
*  In Ivan and Anna's small town, life went on as usual. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2871.8s)]
*  Most everyone was employed by the government in one way or another. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2875.56s)]
*  No one was interested in losing a job to hold a piece of paper in the air. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2879.24s)]
*  If before the war, everyone used to say, yeah, we have a lot of problems, but [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2883.4799999999996s)]
*  at least there is no war. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2886.9199999999996s)]
*  Now they began to say, well, at least the war doesn't touch us. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2888.3199999999997s)]
*  We live as we live. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2892.08s)]
*  We have our own problems here. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2893.3199999999997s)]
*  Across Russian bases in mess holes and [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2896.4799999999996s)]
*  offices during the 24 hour shifts at duty stations, bored and [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2898.6s)]
*  chatting to fill the time, everyone seemed to just assume that because this war was [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2902.7999999999997s)]
*  happening, then this war was how it should be. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2906.96s)]
*  They should just continue to practice their patience, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2910.76s)]
*  that moral apathy they had been honing. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2913.84s)]
*  Their TVs told them that things were going well anyway. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2916.76s)]
*  Those who followed the news on Telegram might talk about it with those they trusted. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2920.04s)]
*  Did you see that the 90th Guard's tank division had been ambushed on the outskirts [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2924.92s)]
*  of Kiev, or the tanks were stalled on highways because they didn't have enough fuel? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2928.64s)]
*  But no one talked explicitly about why. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2933.96s)]
*  A person could not say that they were against what was happening. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2937.12s)]
*  At most, they might wonder aloud, why do we need this war? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2940.44s)]
*  Well, we have enemies in the West. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2945.2400000000002s)]
*  But couldn't this have been handled more intelligently? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2949.0s)]
*  Couldn't the Crimea scenario have been followed? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2952.2s)]
*  Couldn't we have supported pro-Russian forces in Ukraine or done a coup? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2954.92s)]
*  Maybe there's no other way. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2960.0s)]
*  Many probably did not have a strong opinion. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2963.08s)]
*  Collectively, Russians didn't seem to know what to think. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2966.2400000000002s)]
*  The Independent Levada Center found that while 81% told pollsters they supported [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2969.8s)]
*  the actions of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, 51% felt pride for Russia, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2974.7200000000003s)]
*  and 31% felt anxiety, fear, horror. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2980.4s)]
*  36% believed that the rest of the world condemned Russia for [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2984.96s)]
*  the conflict because those countries obey the United States and NATO, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2988.2400000000002s)]
*  while 27% said it was because the world has always been against Russia. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2992.4799999999996s)]
*  The West responded with sweeping sanctions. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=2998.4399999999996s)]
*  The ruble cratered. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3001.4799999999996s)]
*  But if the move was intended to get the Russian people to rise up against Putin's [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3003.3599999999997s)]
*  regime, it failed. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3006.6s)]
*  Of course, there were some radical patriots who truly supported the invasion. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3009.52s)]
*  But there were also careerists. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3014.0s)]
*  And even if they had a negative attitude toward the war, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3016.24s)]
*  there were plenty who thought, yeah, it's bad, but it's ours. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3019.12s)]
*  Or, well, since my army is fighting, I can't betray it. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3023.16s)]
*  The thing about men in the military is that they are military men. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3027.16s)]
*  They believe the propaganda that Kiev was overrun with neo-Nazis, or [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3031.72s)]
*  that NATO was poised to invade Russia, or they just wanted to see combat. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3036.2s)]
*  But anyone who expressed surprise at Russia's initially dismal performance [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3042.0s)]
*  had obviously never set foot on a base. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3046.2799999999997s)]
*  All those photo reports taken at clever angles, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3049.24s)]
*  showing full shelves at empty warehouses. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3052.08s)]
*  A decade of Shoigu's appearance over reality theatrics [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3055.08s)]
*  had left Russia's soldiers poorly trained and equipped. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3058.56s)]
*  The reforms half completed and never fully rooted in military culture. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3062.24s)]
*  It was much easier to walk in unopposed in Crimea, send in soldiers without [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3066.3199999999997s)]
*  insignia to support separatists in Donbas, or [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3072.0s)]
*  dominate rebel militias in Syria through air superiority. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3075.16s)]
*  Moreover, it didn't seem that Russia's armed forces actually understood [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3079.88s)]
*  what they were doing in Ukraine. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3084.3199999999997s)]
*  Their commanding officers had not been given instructions or [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3086.7999999999997s)]
*  battle plans in advance. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3089.68s)]
*  Rather than following traditional Russian military doctrine, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3092.04s)]
*  the invasion looked like a botched operation based on faulty intelligence [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3095.16s)]
*  arranged by a few civilians in the Kremlin who had never served a day in their lives. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3099.4s)]
*  It didn't even follow the basic tactical theory that Ivan learned as a cadet. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3104.7599999999998s)]
*  To go on the offensive, you needed to outnumber your opponent three to one. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3109.48s)]
*  The Kremlin's reaction to failure was swift. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3115.4s)]
*  In early March, the rubber-stamped parliament fast-tracked two laws [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3118.36s)]
*  imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading fake news about the armed forces [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3121.6s)]
*  or discrediting its actions. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3127.44s)]
*  Two weeks later, it amended the laws to effectively ban criticism of all [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3129.88s)]
*  Russian government actions abroad, calling what was happening in Ukraine [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3133.72s)]
*  a war or an invasion was quickly made illegal. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3138.0s)]
*  Instead, it would be called a special military operation, SVO. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3141.56s)]
*  The few bastions of independent media that held out through the last two decades [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3146.32s)]
*  were banned or closed one by one. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3150.24s)]
*  Most of the foreign press quickly fled the country. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3153.16s)]
*  By April, the authorities had detained 15,000 protesters. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3156.72s)]
*  Russian courts had already made a practice of charging people retroactively [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3161.04s)]
*  under other laws for extremism, for engaging with undesirable organizations [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3164.76s)]
*  like those promoting human rights and personal liberties, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3169.96s)]

*  Many started deleting their social media profiles completely. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3179.28s)]
*  Others, like Anna, just censored themselves. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3183.0800000000004s)]
*  Some horrified liberals left the country. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3186.2000000000003s)]
*  It was only a matter of time before the authorities would start sending those [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3189.0400000000004s)]
*  caught protesting to the front lines. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3193.08s)]
*  At Ivan's morning formation, commanders began asking for volunteers to go to the SVO. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3197.72s)]
*  The first group of roughly 30 soldiers from his base shipped out in April. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3203.4s)]
*  At the beginning, the men stepped forward quietly on their own. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3208.16s)]
*  No one forced them to do it. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3211.92s)]
*  So everyone on the base was surprised when two of them returned not too long after deployment. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3213.96s)]
*  Ivan sought them out. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3219.48s)]
*  It's completely savage, they explained. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3221.44s)]
*  A total bacchanalia. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3223.7200000000003s)]
*  Chaos. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3225.48s)]
*  We are never going back there. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3226.6400000000003s)]
*  The looting, the drinking, the utter lack of military discipline. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3228.6000000000004s)]
*  Insanity. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3231.92s)]
*  Their platoon leader had simply vanished. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3233.4s)]
*  The rest of the troops seemed to disappear too. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3236.0400000000004s)]
*  I'm walking alone, one of them told Ivan. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3239.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3241.7200000000003s)]
*  I see some dry rations lying there, so I took it and ate it. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3243.1200000000003s)]
*  I thought, what the fuck do I need all this for? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3246.5600000000004s)]
*  Picked up, packed up, and left. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3248.48s)]
*  The man left his machine gun in Ukraine and owed a large fine for losing it. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3251.16s)]
*  I don't care about the fine, he told Ivan. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3255.72s)]
*  I'll pay it. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3257.72s)]
*  Just fire me faster. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3258.64s)]
*  A few men became a horde. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3261.24s)]
*  Soldiers stampeding their way back to base. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3263.3199999999997s)]
*  Men who had been scattered along different parts of the front line [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3266.44s)]
*  ended up running into one another at the airport in Moscow. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3269.52s)]
*  They had fled on their own dime, unauthorized. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3272.8399999999997s)]
*  You're alone too? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3276.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not fucking going back there. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3278.3999999999996s)]
*  Soldiers were just walking off the battlefield and returning to their bases. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3281.7999999999997s)]
*  Across Russia, entire units refused to fight. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3286.24s)]
*  In late March, 300 servicemen from a unit from Bunaksk Dagestan [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3290.04s)]
*  laid down their arms and left Ukraine. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3294.56s)]
*  By April, 500 National Guardsmen had been dismissed [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3297.3199999999997s)]
*  for leaving Ukraine after just four days. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3300.48s)]
*  That month, it became public that 11 members of Oman, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3303.3199999999997s)]
*  a dreaded unit of riot police officers, had refused to deploy. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3306.68s)]
*  In July, 150 contract soldiers from the 5th Separate Guards Tank Brigade [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3311.04s)]
*  were dismissed after refusing to cross the border into Ukraine. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3315.8s)]
*  At the time, a soldier could be AWOL for over a week [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3320.08s)]
*  without prompting a criminal investigation. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3323.2s)]
*  So the early refuse-nicks didn't face immediate imprisonment [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3325.68s)]
*  for leaving the front. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3328.64s)]
*  But they could be fired, and for many soldiers, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3330.2s)]
*  the threat of termination was deterrent enough. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3332.76s)]
*  These men were often their family's only breadwinner. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3335.64s)]
*  They would be giving up their entire life's accomplishments, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3338.88s)]
*  their right to free health care, child care, apartments, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3342.04s)]
*  extra veterans' payments, to step into the abyss and poverty [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3345.7200000000003s)]
*  of civilian life with no training in anything [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3349.28s)]
*  other than posing for photo reports ripping up dandelions. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3352.6800000000003s)]
*  But even those who actually wanted to be fired [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3357.36s)]
*  didn't necessarily get their wish. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3359.96s)]
*  Depending on a man's supervisor, it wasn't always easy [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3362.48s)]
*  to terminate a contract, especially as rank increased, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3365.04s)]
*  there was a ton of paperwork and headaches for everyone, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3368.7999999999997s)]
*  especially the higher-ups. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3371.72s)]
*  So there were men who drank a bottle of vodka, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3373.68s)]
*  went to the police officers, and did something stupid [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3376.16s)]
*  in front of them so that they would be taken [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3379.04s)]
*  to the medical department, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3380.8399999999997s)]
*  where they would refuse a medical examination. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3382.3999999999996s)]
*  According to a provision in the military regulations, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3385.24s)]
*  this would trigger an early discharge. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3388.0s)]
*  Refusal of a mandatory medical examination [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3390.3199999999997s)]
*  is akin to the use of banned substances in Russia. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3392.9599999999996s)]
*  A soldier could lose his driver's license [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3396.52s)]
*  and be forced to attend a drug treatment center. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3398.32s)]
*  But if this allowed him to get out, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3401.1600000000003s)]
*  that was not too high a price to pay. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3403.04s)]
*  Not everybody was ready to go to such extremes. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3406.56s)]
*  There were those who thought, yes, it's bad, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3409.6000000000004s)]
*  and I do not want to participate in it, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3411.4s)]
*  but I've got a bit of time left until retirement, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3413.1200000000003s)]
*  so I'll try to sit through it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3415.1200000000003s)]
*  Maybe no one will notice me, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3416.96s)]
*  and I'll just stay here on my base. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3418.2000000000003s)]
*  Those people would have loved to quit, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3420.92s)]
*  but on their terms, with all the pay, benefits, and so on, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3423.1200000000003s)]
*  sure, the army they served in might be killing people, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3427.04s)]
*  but they weren't the ones doing it, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3430.2s)]
*  just cogs in the larger mechanism. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3432.08s)]
*  The existential question repeated, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3434.88s)]
*  who should be held accountable for the will of one man? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3437.48s)]
*  Russians had been honing their skill of tolerance, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3442.4s)]
*  that patient waiting without truly expecting [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3445.44s)]
*  anything to change. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3447.8s)]
*  The thing is, they weren't asking for anything more [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3449.6s)]
*  than what they had worked hard for all those years. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3452.04s)]
*  This would describe an overwhelming majority [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3455.24s)]
*  of Russian service members, and it included Ivan, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3457.4399999999996s)]
*  who believed he could continue to follow his plan. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3460.7999999999997s)]
*  They wanted to stay in a military that was fighting a war, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3464.12s)]
*  collect their paychecks, get their retirement benefits, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3467.16s)]
*  and leave without ever stepping foot on the front line. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3470.2799999999997s)]
*  The phrase, to have your cake and eat it too, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3473.72s)]
*  in Russian slang is, to eat the fish and sit on the dick. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3476.6s)]
*  Evidence that this hope was misplaced was mounting. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3481.28s)]
*  After the first few months of the invasion, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3484.96s)]
*  volunteers began to dry up, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3487.28s)]
*  and the authorities began an enlistment drive. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3489.5600000000004s)]
*  Plackards went up around the provinces [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3492.52s)]
*  heralding heroes of the SVO, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3494.36s)]
*  calling men to join as private mercenaries [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3496.96s)]
*  or enlisted contractniki. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3499.6400000000003s)]
*  Recruiters offered huge sign-up bonuses [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3501.88s)]
*  and promises of coffin money. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3504.0s)]
*  The Ministry of Defense would ultimately produce [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3506.44s)]
*  sleek television ads that exhorted taxi drivers, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3508.8399999999997s)]
*  personal trainers, and security guards to man up, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3511.64s)]
*  showing footage of their boring lives and asking them, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3514.68s)]
*  is this the path you really want to choose? [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3517.64s)]
*  Each man then morphed into a kitted-out soldier [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3520.64s)]
*  moving through fog. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3523.2s)]
*  The video explained that the monthly payments [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3524.8799999999997s)]
*  started at $2,000, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3527.04s)]
*  roughly triple the nation's average income. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3528.7999999999997s)]
*  Another ad promised land tax exemptions, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3531.7999999999997s)]
*  compensation for household utility bills, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3534.8399999999997s)]

*  Anna saw them so often she had memorized them. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3544.3599999999997s)]
*  Strategically, the Kremlin could have started a mobilization [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3548.3599999999997s)]
*  right away to build up a reserve force, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3550.7999999999997s)]

*  to get by with the troops it had, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3555.3599999999997s)]

*  because of how many men he had lost. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3895.7999999999997s)]
*  Once, the Butcher was sitting in his basement [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3898.2s)]
*  playing some kind of racing game on his phone [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3900.24s)]
*  when a platoon commander who had just been on the attack [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3902.2s)]
*  came in and told him, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3904.82s)]
*  Here, comrade colonel, at the attack, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3906.3s)]
*  there are this many 300s, this many 200s. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3908.2000000000003s)]
*  The Butcher continued playing as he listened. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3912.04s)]
*  Then he sat straight up and shouted, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3914.4s)]
*  Duty guard, order me a pizza, and returned to his game. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3916.2400000000002s)]
*  On August 1st, their base commander, Colonel S., [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3922.94s)]
*  asked Ivan and his platoon to line up [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3926.38s)]
*  in front of the podium during flag raising. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3928.28s)]
*  In front of the entire assembly, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3931.32s)]
*  he informed them that they were being sent [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3933.2799999999997s)]
*  to the SVO as infantry. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3934.86s)]
*  They'd been expecting something like this. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3937.86s)]
*  The whole platoon refused on the spot. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3940.2s)]
*  They demanded to see a combat order [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3943.02s)]
*  that officially listed their names. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3944.56s)]
*  Do you want to be terminated? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3946.96s)]
*  S. asked them. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3948.2999999999997s)]
*  Since you refuse, write me a report of your refusal. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3949.86s)]
*  Ivan believed that S. was bluffing, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3954.24s)]
*  that there was no combat order with their names. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3956.44s)]
*  But if they wrote a statement of refusal, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3958.92s)]
*  it would be the pretext to terminate their contracts. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3960.8s)]
*  Many of his men did it anyway. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3964.0s)]
*  They were young. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3965.94s)]
*  They didn't have anything to lose but their lives. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3966.98s)]
*  But Ivan had worked too hard for too long. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3969.48s)]
*  He had completed nearly 20 years of service, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3972.32s)]
*  more if you counted all his overtime. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3974.6800000000003s)]
*  He was ready to start his new life. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3977.28s)]
*  He was enrolled in retraining, taking coding classes online, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3979.52s)]
*  trying to set up a Bitcoin mining business on the side. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3983.02s)]
*  Everything was within his reach if he stuck to the plan. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3986.1000000000004s)]
*  Ivan consulted with a lawyer who told him that the army could fire him only for [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3991.1600000000003s)]
*  refusing orders. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3995.5s)]
*  So in his refusal report, he wrote that he hadn't actually refused. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=3997.3s)]
*  Instead, he had misunderstood the task his commander had set out. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4001.32s)]
*  He was not refusing to go to the SVO outright. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4005.36s)]
*  He would go, but in his current position, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4008.1200000000003s)]
*  which would keep him far from the grinding front line. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4010.46s)]
*  He cited his failing health. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4013.7200000000003s)]
*  For years, Ivan had a herniated disc. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4015.6000000000004s)]
*  He wanted to be medically excused. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4018.36s)]
*  Since his experience with PIG, Ivan had been collecting documents. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4021.32s)]
*  So he already had everything to prove that he had medical problems and [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4025.1600000000003s)]
*  was owed more than 300 days of overtime. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4028.8s)]
*  He took the paperwork to the Human Resources Office and [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4032.2400000000002s)]
*  submitted a statement requesting his time off. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4035.0800000000004s)]
*  Ivan wanted to show that he was problematic. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4038.36s)]
*  If the army wanted to fire him, fine, but he would not go down without a fight. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4041.44s)]
*  If it was more work for the army to terminate him than it was to let him [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4046.1600000000003s)]
*  continue serving, maybe it would leave him alone. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4049.06s)]
*  Perhaps he could draw this out for [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4052.82s)]
*  the few weeks that remained until he left for retraining. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4054.18s)]
*  But when Ivan called the retraining center, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4058.86s)]
*  he was told that his enrollment had been canceled. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4061.2599999999998s)]
*  He couldn't believe it. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4064.18s)]
*  He had the confirmation paper in hand, stamped, signed by the retraining center, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4065.74s)]
*  signed by his supervisor, and signed again by the base commander. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4070.22s)]
*  How could the center just cancel his admission? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4074.5s)]
*  Was that even possible? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4077.2599999999998s)]
*  He could only guess that the colonel's office had contacted the center, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4079.86s)]
*  called him a bastard for refusing to serve, and that was it. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4083.02s)]
*  Can they really deny me retraining, he asked the head of the program. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4087.38s)]
*  Kind of came the reply. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4091.54s)]
*  Russia's legal system uses the trappings of a rules-based order [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4094.82s)]
*  as window dressing for an authoritarian state. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4098.86s)]
*  If you follow the complicated minutiae of the law to the letter, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4102.34s)]
*  sometimes you can stand your ground and win. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4105.62s)]
*  That gives people hope to keep trying, but [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4108.34s)]
*  other times the regime changes the rules in the middle without warning. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4110.92s)]
*  It was as if you were playing chess with an abusive opponent. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4115.28s)]
*  Sometimes you could pull a queen's gambit. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4118.76s)]
*  Sometimes your opponent just smashed you in the face with a board. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4121.4800000000005s)]
*  Ivan decided he would fight back. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4125.400000000001s)]
*  He would sue Colonel S for [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4127.92s)]
*  denying him his rightful retraining if he tried to fire him. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4129.8s)]
*  Where is the refusal report? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4134.68s)]
*  S confronted Ivan at the parade grounds another morning. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4136.780000000001s)]
*  I'm going to sue you, Commander, sir, Ivan replied. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4140.58s)]
*  S walked up to him, bent down to his ear. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4144.820000000001s)]
*  Fuck you, he whispered before straightening up. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4147.780000000001s)]
*  That's it, get out of here. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4150.66s)]
*  Don't show up at the base again. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4152.7s)]
*  Ivan was suspended. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4156.02s)]
*  His lawyer advised him to continue attending the morning formation so [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4157.780000000001s)]
*  no one could accuse him of being AWOL. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4161.26s)]
*  They would fight his dismissal in court as wrongful termination. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4164.0s)]
*  Ivan never technically refused any official order. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4167.759999999999s)]
*  If he were fired, he would be left with nothing. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4171.04s)]
*  Ivan would show up to the base for roll call and [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4174.16s)]
*  go home for the rest of the day waiting for his termination. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4176.2s)]
*  Ivan and Anna discussed it and tried to put a positive spin on things. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4180.2s)]
*  It could be a lot worse. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4184.5199999999995s)]
*  After he was fired, they would start their lives again, even with nothing. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4186.5599999999995s)]
*  Across Russia, other officers were refusing to go to the front. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4190.24s)]
*  A far more dangerous trend for the war effort than the refusal of an average [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4196.219999999999s)]
*  contractnik. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4200.26s)]
*  Officers who refused couldn't be discharged. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4201.86s)]
*  They were too valuable. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4204.74s)]
*  The state had paid for them to be trained for this. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4206.38s)]
*  Instead, all manner of pressure was applied to ship them out. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4209.66s)]
*  They were mocked mercilessly in front of assemblies, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4213.58s)]
*  marched around to the base's political affairs office for conversations, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4216.4800000000005s)]
*  sent from there to different cabinets of commanders for more conversations. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4220.52s)]
*  Everywhere, it was as if they were reading from the same playbook. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4225.12s)]
*  What are you, a traitor? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4228.72s)]
*  Abandoning your own subordinates? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4230.56s)]
*  You're not a man. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4232.72s)]
*  Pull yourself together, coward. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4234.08s)]
*  Then threats. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4236.12s)]
*  We'll put you in jail. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4237.32s)]
*  We'll find a reason to put you away. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4238.72s)]
*  We'll turn you into the prosecutor's office. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4240.52s)]
*  Then harm. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4243.12s)]
*  We will take you out, handcuff you to a radiator, and shoot. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4244.5s)]
*  The risks of refusing orders once a man arrived behind the ribbon, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4249.379999999999s)]

*  They had all heard rumors about the pits, the basements where officers were held [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4256.179999999999s)]
*  against their will for refusing to fight. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4260.339999999999s)]
*  There was also a bulletin board, which soldiers took to calling the Wall of [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4263.7s)]
*  Shame, at the center of Ivan's base displaying the portraits of these men. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4267.139999999999s)]
*  Everyone knew that the Russian military had no squeamishness about extrajudicial [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4272.24s)]
*  reprisals. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4276.72s)]
*  Throw a man in a ditch and shoot him, and tell his relatives he deserted. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4278.280000000001s)]
*  As rumors of Ivan's refusal to be sent to the front spread through their small town, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4284.84s)]
*  people in the street butted into Anna's life. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4289.84s)]
*  Your husband came up with the idea of not participating or something, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4292.72s)]
*  they clucked. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4295.68s)]
*  Soon, the head of Anna's department again called her into her office. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4297.360000000001s)]
*  What do you mean your husband doesn't want to? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4301.2s)]
*  We must defend our country. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4303.54s)]

*  That's his job. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4306.98s)]
*  Anna wanted to shout at them that it was Ivan's job to protect his country, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4309.26s)]
*  to defend the homeland. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4313.94s)]
*  If something happened on their territory, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4316.38s)]
*  she was sure Ivan would be the first to volunteer. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4318.7s)]
*  But forcing a man to kill for no reason, it was a big difference. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4322.5s)]
*  She didn't dare say any of that aloud. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4326.86s)]
*  Yes, I understand, she would reply. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4329.52s)]
*  We've made that decision, that's it. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4331.88s)]
*  She tried to speak neutrally, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4334.72s)]
*  to stay detached without stirring up unnecessary conversations. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4336.48s)]
*  She felt she had no other tools, only that she could deaden her bright eyes on command. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4340.64s)]
*  Anna and Ivan were part of the state machine. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4347.6s)]
*  If she wanted to survive, she could not start any fights, but [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4350.52s)]
*  she could not rhetorically cave either. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4353.84s)]
*  This small shred of dignity was all that remained. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4356.580000000001s)]
*  On September 21st, Putin appeared on their televisions and [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4361.02s)]
*  announced a partial mobilization. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4364.3s)]
*  There had been rumors for weeks. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4367.06s)]
*  The front was hemorrhaging men. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4369.14s)]
*  I will repeat, we are talking specifically about partial mobilization, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4371.46s)]
*  Putin decreed, trying to preempt the panic that followed. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4375.5s)]
*  The priority will be those who have served in the ranks of the armed forces and [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4379.54s)]
*  of certain military specialties and relevant experience. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4383.320000000001s)]
*  Before being sent to the place of service, those who are drafted will undergo [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4386.96s)]
*  mandatory additional military training based on the experience of a special [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4390.6s)]
*  military operation. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4394.92s)]
*  What Putin had not announced, but was written clearly on the defense [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4397.76s)]
*  ministry's website, was that the mobilization included a stop loss measure [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4400.8s)]
*  in which personnel remained on active duty involuntarily until the end of [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4405.68s)]
*  wartime conditions. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4410.08s)]
*  Military strategists weren't sure what took the Kremlin so long. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4412.259999999999s)]
*  With very few exceptions, no man could be terminated. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4416.219999999999s)]
*  No contracts would be broken. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4419.66s)]
*  Ivan had no idea if his commanding officer had submitted his termination [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4421.94s)]
*  documents in time. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4425.54s)]
*  Would his punishment be his salvation? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4427.5s)]
*  Anna was at a girlfriend's house when Ivan called her. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4430.74s)]
*  Did you hear the news? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4433.7s)]
*  Mobilization, she asked, though she already knew. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4435.42s)]
*  Yes, he replied. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4438.62s)]
*  She understood everything. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4440.56s)]
*  She hung up. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4442.360000000001s)]
*  He's announced a mobilization, she told her friend. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4443.88s)]
*  I'm off. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4446.8s)]
*  Anna got up, went outside, and realized she was floating. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4448.68s)]
*  The kind of shock where she couldn't feel anything happening around her. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4452.76s)]
*  A man walked toward her. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4456.400000000001s)]
*  You understand that mobilization is happening, she told him. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4457.84s)]
*  What, he asked. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4461.320000000001s)]
*  You understand mobilization is happening, she shouted. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4463.12s)]
*  She needed to get through to him, to someone, even a stranger. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4466.46s)]
*  She needed him to know that he should run. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4470.9s)]
*  Previously, there were plenty of ways to skip mandatory national military service. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4475.219999999999s)]
*  A man could rack up deferments until he was over 27. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4480.219999999999s)]
*  If he went to trade school, if he went to college, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4483.86s)]
*  if he entered a graduate program. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4486.299999999999s)]
*  If he was in college, he could sign up for the military department and [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4488.54s)]
*  graduate as a lieutenant in the reserves without ever serving a day. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4491.98s)]
*  Defense Minister Shoigu did this. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4496.02s)]
*  He could get a health exemption, sometimes real, sometimes not so real. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4498.52s)]
*  There had been no meaningful penalty for non-compliance with a draft notice. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4502.84s)]
*  A fine of $50 for ignoring it. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4507.200000000001s)]
*  But the mobilization threw all that into disarray. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4509.96s)]
*  If the war's toll had been confined largely to military families who are mostly from [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4513.68s)]
*  the poorer interior of the country, now the regime was coming for [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4517.8s)]
*  the sons of the middle class. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4521.56s)]
*  On the day of the announcement, 1,300 people were arrested for [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4522.96s)]
*  protesting, risking jail terms of up to 15 years. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4528.2s)]
*  But most showed their opposition by fleeing for their lives. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4532.4s)]
*  Plane, train, and bus tickets out of Russia were selling out quickly at [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4536.1s)]
*  astronomical sums. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4539.7s)]
*  Everyone worried that the borders were closing. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4542.1s)]
*  The land crossings to Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, and [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4544.9s)]
*  Finland swelled with carfuls of men. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4548.18s)]
*  They waited for days. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4551.22s)]
*  There were rumors, arguments, stabbing, stampedes. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4552.8s)]
*  When people died in line, ambulances couldn't make it through the crush to [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4556.28s)]
*  pick up the bodies. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4559.92s)]
*  Telegram groups monitored the situation, advising which roads were blocked and [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4561.92s)]
*  which checkpoints had the shortest lines. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4566.24s)]
*  The Georgian authorities closed one of the pedestrian crossings. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4568.88s)]
*  Only people on wheels would be allowed in. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4572.2s)]
*  Men traded belongings for bicycles and scooters and [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4574.8s)]
*  dumped them after reaching the other side. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4577.639999999999s)]
*  A mangled monument to their leaders' ambitions. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4580.02s)]
*  Hotels and hostels in border towns were so full that people camped out on the [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4583.42s)]
*  floors of movie theaters, mosques, and railway stations. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4587.54s)]
*  In the first week after the partial mobilization, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4592.14s)]
*  an estimated 200,000 people left Russia. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4594.82s)]
*  But the population of Russia is 146 million, as many as 25 million of whom [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4598.46s)]
*  were draftable, including retired senior officers up to age 65. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4604.3s)]
*  There were still plenty of bodies to choose from. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4609.94s)]
*  People without the means to flee or those without a good understanding of their [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4613.12s)]
*  rights. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4617.32s)]
*  The state called up 300,000 reservists at first, but [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4618.679999999999s)]
*  the total permitted number of mobilized was classified. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4622.48s)]
*  The opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta said it could number up to 1 million. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4626.12s)]
*  The country's bureaucracy was not ready to handle such a Herculean undertaking. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4631.9s)]
*  Officials did not have a strong reserve force, just lists of men who had done [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4637.16s)]
*  their national service and what their specializations were, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4641.28s)]
*  which most hadn't maintained or refreshed for years or decades. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4644.74s)]
*  It was clear that the authorities were targeting poorer regions. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4648.98s)]
*  Quotas were levied on districts, which simplified the task. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4652.68s)]
*  But it also incentivized the local authorities to speed up their results. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4656.58s)]
*  Instead of serving specific people with summonses, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4660.9s)]
*  they started rounding up men en masse. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4663.46s)]
*  They pressured them to go to the front and [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4666.34s)]
*  demanded that they turn over their documents in order to process them as draftees. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4668.099999999999s)]
*  In those circumstances, the men hadn't technically been served as summons and [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4672.62s)]
*  could leave, but no one told them that. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4676.34s)]
*  Others were served draft notices at their places of employment by secretaries, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4679.82s)]
*  some of whom were themselves on the verge of tears. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4684.62s)]
*  People received papers at their homes, at their parents' homes. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4687.74s)]
*  Doctors were drafted. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4691.74s)]
*  Sometimes the only medical provider in town was ordered to the front. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4693.280000000001s)]
*  Women too, surgeons, gynecologists, dentists, all sent to Ukraine. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4697.280000000001s)]
*  By mid-October, 2,457 protesters had been arrested. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4703.76s)]
*  Many of the men who were detained were given military summonses. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4709.16s)]
*  1,747 administrative cases were opened, and [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4713.2s)]
*  58 people faced criminal charges, 10 of whom posted their protest online. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4717.56s)]
*  Thirty-six military recruitment offices and [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4723.16s)]
*  other government buildings were set on fire. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4725.34s)]
*  Penance for decades of national silence was beginning. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4728.9s)]
*  Dutifully, the avalanche reported to local enlistment offices with their summonses. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4732.78s)]
*  But those offices were also at a loss. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4737.9s)]
*  Reservists needed to be served, processed, medically checked, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4740.62s)]
*  switched to active status, sent to training, outfitted, housed, and fed. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4744.54s)]
*  But there didn't seem to be a plan in place to do any of that. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4750.160000000001s)]
*  The draftees arrived with their friends, their wives, their girlfriends, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4753.68s)]
*  their children, their mothers. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4756.84s)]
*  Everyone was stressed and in shock. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4759.200000000001s)]
*  Where are they going? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4761.84s)]
*  With whom? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4763.18s)]
*  What should they bring? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4763.96s)]
*  Do they really have to go? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4765.320000000001s)]
*  They had dependents, debts, health problems. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=4767.200000000001s)]

*  He was busy making lists of things he would need to acquire to ensure [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5228.0s)]
*  that he would see Anna and Sasha again. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5231.76s)]
*  The troop transport made multiple stops as it crept across Russia. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5235.280000000001s)]
*  Along the way, Ivan started buying things to augment his military issued gear. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5239.56s)]
*  He got kit from an injured Wagner fighter who had just returned from Mariupol. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5244.76s)]
*  The guy sold him everything he had, body armor with a rope and a carabiner, [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5249.0s)]
*  as well as a tactical belt and a first aid kit. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5253.56s)]
*  The mercenary didn't rip him off. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5256.4400000000005s)]
*  He even went to the airport to meet him because he knew Ivan was in a rush. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5258.6s)]
*  Ivan also bought himself lower boots. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5262.64s)]
*  He had read online that they withstood shrapnel from improvised explosive [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5265.160000000001s)]
*  devices. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5268.4800000000005s)]
*  He wasn't sure it was true, but anything was worth trying. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5269.76s)]
*  He bought an axe and a knife. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5273.280000000001s)]
*  He tried to cajole the men around him to equip themselves too. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5275.160000000001s)]
*  Guys, you're going to war, you could die. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5278.52s)]
*  Of course, the bullet is a fool, he quoted Alexander Suvorov, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5281.92s)]
*  one of Russia's most famous generals. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5285.76s)]
*  But the odds go up when you have normal equipment. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5287.92s)]
*  I can't, they replied. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5291.280000000001s)]
*  I'm bad, man. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5293.12s)]
*  Ivan thought it was depression. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5294.88s)]
*  Maybe he just wanted to be alive a little more than they did. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5297.04s)]
*  Maybe, as Anna had said, he really was greedy for life. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5300.280000000001s)]
*  Ivan's transport truck rolled across the border into Ukraine with little fanfare. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5305.72s)]
*  Just one and a long convoy on a broken road. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5310.72s)]
*  It had taken them three days to reach this point. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5314.16s)]
*  They were never briefed on anything, just loaded, unloaded, and [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5317.04s)]
*  reloaded into helicopters, planes, and trucks. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5320.48s)]
*  The front was squalid. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5324.2s)]
*  Their final stop was a tent encampment somewhere in a strip of forest. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5326.08s)]
*  But even there, Ivan spotted Ukrainian quadcopters overhead. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5330.08s)]
*  There was trash everywhere, toilet paper, bottles, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5333.5599999999995s)]
*  rations wrappers, boxes, boots in the grass. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5338.16s)]
*  Ivan was baffled. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5341.76s)]
*  Didn't these men realize that the Ukrainians would see this crap? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5343.44s)]
*  They would throw their own shit back at them in the form of rockets at their heads. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5347.24s)]
*  Some lieutenant colonel from troop services with a mustache came by in [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5352.759999999999s)]
*  an old Soviet car to welcome them. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5356.08s)]
*  Settle in here and they'll come get you, he said as he drove away. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5358.639999999999s)]
*  And Ivan soon discovered an immutable fact. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5362.32s)]
*  War can be exceedingly boring. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5365.24s)]
*  The newly arrived men set about collecting the trash. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5368.04s)]
*  The Russians had deployed across the front corresponding roughly to [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5370.72s)]
*  the military district that the troops were from. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5374.72s)]
*  So a base from the Leningrad region would be at a different spot than a base from [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5378.4400000000005s)]
*  the Novosibirsk region. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5382.280000000001s)]
*  As a result, everyone knew someone when he got to the front. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5384.16s)]
*  The newly mobilized mobics were usually distributed to units from their own [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5388.0s)]
*  region. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5392.0s)]
*  When a new shipment of soldiers arrived from their base, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5393.92s)]
*  the units sent their buyers, scouts, to plug holes in their rank and file. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5396.5199999999995s)]
*  They would come by looking for a rifleman or an RPG gunner or a tank driver and [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5401.16s)]
*  so on. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5406.0s)]
*  The men who weren't chosen by scouts passed their time talking or [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5407.48s)]
*  drinking whatever they had managed to bring. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5410.639999999999s)]
*  One by one, everyone was selected until just the rogue officers were left. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5413.24s)]
*  Maybe no one wants us. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5418.32s)]
*  That was fine with them. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5420.16s)]
*  They had no cell reception, but Ivan took photos of everything. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5421.799999999999s)]
*  The trench, the tents, the coffee, thinking he would find a way to send them to Anna. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5425.32s)]
*  After a few days of loafing around, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5431.12s)]
*  they decided to go to a village they saw on their drive over. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5433.04s)]
*  They stopped the first civilian car they saw. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5436.48s)]
*  Will you give us a ride? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5438.88s)]
*  The older man obliged. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5440.5199999999995s)]
*  Ivan imagined it from his perspective. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5442.28s)]
*  Big guys with machine guns sauntering down the street. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5444.8s)]
*  Who could refuse? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5447.96s)]
*  The driver had no idea that the officers hadn't even been issued ammunition. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5449.48s)]
*  In town, it seemed that everything was set up to service the front. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5453.36s)]
*  There were power banks charging and [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5458.32s)]
*  a big plastic tank where people gathered to get water. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5459.68s)]
*  The post office was selling SIM cards so soldiers could call home. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5463.08s)]
*  A girl at the local shop was even running a currency transfer service. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5467.32s)]
*  Families in Russia could transfer money to a Russian account and [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5471.28s)]
*  for a commission, the girl would give the soldiers the cash. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5474.5599999999995s)]
*  They bought water, bread, and sausages. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5477.8s)]
*  It felt to Ivan just like being in Russia. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5480.48s)]
*  The same small villages, the same old Soviet cars, the same broken roads. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5483.0s)]
*  Though he tried to ask how things were, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5488.44s)]
*  he knew the locals wouldn't tell him the truth. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5490.32s)]
*  It didn't occur to Ivan to consider himself an occupier. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5492.92s)]
*  After all, he was there against his will. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5496.28s)]
*  Guilt is a peacetime luxury. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5499.24s)]
*  They had been at the front for five days when Colonel S himself arrived. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5502.52s)]
*  He was looking for Ivan personally. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5506.64s)]
*  I need you to write a report, as told him. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5509.24s)]
*  What report? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5512.04s)]
*  Didn't you file a lawsuit against me? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5513.5199999999995s)]
*  They need you to write an additional report. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5515.8s)]
*  We'll take a picture of it and send it in. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5517.92s)]
*  Ivan couldn't even fathom it. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5520.44s)]
*  A report? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5522.24s)]
*  Like on a paper with pen? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5523.44s)]
*  He didn't have those. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5525.36s)]
*  They didn't even have water. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5526.88s)]
*  This clerical work seemed like such absurdity. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5528.64s)]
*  They could all die right now. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5531.5199999999995s)]
*  Comrade Colonel, what report, Ivan said? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5533.84s)]
*  I'm already at war. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5537.2s)]
*  What more do you need? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5538.24s)]
*  The Colonel looked at him. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5540.2s)]
*  What lawsuit, Ivan said? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5542.2s)]
*  It's over. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5544.32s)]
*  I'm already here. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5545.36s)]
*  Then is everything okay, S asked? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5547.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, everything's fine, Ivan said. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5551.2s)]
*  He didn't need to consider it. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5554.2s)]
*  He had been on bad terms with S in Russia, but [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5556.0s)]
*  in war he'd better not look for any enemies. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5558.6s)]
*  The next day, the mustachioed Lieutenant Colonel returned and [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5562.04s)]
*  found Ivan and his fellow rogue officers. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5565.32s)]
*  Guys, we totally forgot we had three officers here. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5568.04s)]
*  Completely forgot, he said. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5571.28s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5573.24s)]
*  The Mobiks have arrived. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5574.24s)]
*  He will train them. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5576.0s)]
*  After Ivan left, Anna remained immobile on the floor of their hallway. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5579.48s)]
*  The pain came from inside a place she didn't even know was empty, and [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5583.84s)]
*  she began to howl. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5587.8s)]
*  She lay there without sensing time or space, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5590.0s)]
*  until she realized she needed to watch Sasha. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5592.96s)]
*  She got up and walked back into the kitchen. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5596.12s)]
*  A friend arrived to try to help. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5598.96s)]
*  Anna heard the sound of an aircraft flying past the house. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5601.5199999999995s)]
*  She understood that Ivan was on it. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5605.04s)]
*  Her friend put her in bed. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5607.48s)]
*  The next day, Anna tried to go to church to pray for Ivan, but [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5610.5599999999995s)]
*  she was too ill to make it. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5613.36s)]
*  She called the only psychiatrist in their town. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5615.44s)]
*  I need medication, she told the doctor. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5618.599999999999s)]
*  I can't handle it, I just can't handle it. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5621.44s)]
*  She walked to the drug store and [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5624.48s)]
*  found a line of women out the door waiting for the same pills. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5626.12s)]
*  I'll give them to all of you without a prescription, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5630.16s)]
*  the pharmacist announced. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5632.36s)]

*  Anna took two different antidepressants at a time. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5637.08s)]
*  They made her ill, but she was hollow anyway. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5640.24s)]
*  A blunt stinging pain along with bitter hatred. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5643.12s)]
*  She despised everybody, but especially people who talked about the war. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5647.04s)]
*  It filled her with a kind of rage she'd never experienced. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5652.12s)]
*  She couldn't criticize the SVO or say anything about the government. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5655.56s)]
*  She couldn't scream or grab hold of the person speaking and shout, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5659.320000000001s)]
*  you've never sent a loved one to their death, you bitch. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5662.56s)]
*  You'll never know what it's like. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5665.8s)]
*  Everything she felt was compounded by the communal silence. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5668.6s)]
*  The feeling that everyone was indifferent or resigned or worse. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5672.280000000001s)]
*  She was horrified by the response of some of the women she knew. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5676.92s)]

*  I've already seen you off. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5696.52s)]
*  It wasn't just enthusiasm. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5699.08s)]
*  There were plenty of stories of women who ran pressure campaigns to persuade their [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5701.24s)]

*  There were mothers who escorted their sons to the enlistment office, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5717.68s)]
*  sometimes against their will. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5720.96s)]
*  One woman, the story went, sent her husband to Wagner and [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5723.160000000001s)]

*  She married another man who joined Wagner and met the same fate. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5728.76s)]

*  She became rich. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5734.56s)]
*  Her social media was covered in their photos. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5736.04s)]
*  My dearest, you are remembered, loved, mourned. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5738.6s)]
*  The government's recruitment propaganda campaign targeted women too. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5743.84s)]
*  The regional authorities took pictures of the wives and [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5748.0s)]

*  Still, for such impoverished people, even such a sum meant something. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5766.96s)]
*  Besides, a mother who received her son's body in a zinc coffin [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5771.36s)]
*  did not want to think that her son was an occupier. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5776.04s)]
*  She wanted to believe that her son was a hero. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5779.44s)]
*  State propaganda convinced her and [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5782.04s)]

*  not for his money, but as part of World War III. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5791.96s)]
*  And she could find some semblance of comfort in that. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5795.719999999999s)]
*  Russian children were already exposed to war glamour from birth. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5798.12s)]
*  Playgrounds with decommissioned tanks instilling in them that war is normal, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5804.04s)]

*  In the 2022 budget, about $130 million was designated for [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5814.599999999999s)]

*  Across government offices, state employees were subject to propaganda. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5917.96s)]
*  At Anna's office, the bosses forced everyone to watch a movie explaining why [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5922.44s)]
*  Russia had no choice but to save Ukraine, showcasing gruesome injuries that [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5926.16s)]

*  They exclaimed. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5947.8s)]
*  What a nightmare. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5949.2s)]
*  Anna wondered how sick in the head they had to be to believe this. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5951.24s)]
*  After Anna's first social media post at the start of the war, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5956.320000000001s)]
*  she decided that she would not post her own content anymore. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5959.88s)]

*  the department head told her. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5975.68s)]
*  This is not a joke, delete it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5977.4s)]
*  Then her direct supervisor called her, I'm begging you. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5980.28s)]

*  Anna deleted the repost. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5990.68s)]
*  And so, whether it was propaganda or intimidation, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5992.76s)]
*  the ensuing silence was the same. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5995.88s)]
*  Anna stopped speaking to her work colleagues. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=5998.64s)]
*  But after Ivan deployed, Anna stepped through the mirror. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6002.12s)]
*  The same people who had cursed and heckled her when rumors spread that Ivan [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6006.24s)]
*  was trying to avoid fighting now told Anna what a hero he was. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6009.96s)]
*  They told her how much they respected her, how they valued her family's sacrifice. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6015.16s)]
*  Don't worry, dear, they coot. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6019.4800000000005s)]

*  She wanted to spit venom in their faces. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6024.6s)]
*  Seven platoons formed up in front of a forest clearing. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6029.240000000001s)]
*  It was mid-October, warm, muddy, and lush. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6032.96s)]
*  The Russians had set up a hive of tents, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6036.88s)]
*  constructed a firing range out of the earth, and organized the mobiques. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6039.400000000001s)]
*  The three rogue officers were assigned their people. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6044.320000000001s)]
*  The rest were led by lieutenants who had themselves just been mobilized. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6047.320000000001s)]
*  The men were nothing like Putin promised. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6052.08s)]
*  Only some of them had military experience. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6054.84s)]
*  Others had zero training. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6057.44s)]
*  Ivan set about choosing his three squad leaders so that when he set a goal, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6059.64s)]
*  they would be the ones to corral the ten men under them to the task. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6063.44s)]
*  In the encampment, many of the men were drinking. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6068.12s)]
*  Ivan couldn't blame them, but he told his squad leaders that they should tell [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6071.04s)]
*  everyone that there was no alcohol in his platoon. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6074.48s)]
*  Drunks were capable of anything. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6077.5199999999995s)]
*  A drunk could see a squirrel run into a tent and throw a grenade at it. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6079.88s)]
*  And it was worse with civilians who had been handed draft papers out of the blue. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6083.68s)]
*  The mobilized, when they are drunk, they are not human, Ivan explained. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6087.96s)]
*  If anything shoots, you have my permission to fire. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6092.36s)]
*  If a drunk walks in our direction and doesn't follow your command to stop, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6094.96s)]
*  shoot in the air and I'll come out. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6098.4800000000005s)]
*  If he still doesn't understand, we'll end him. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6100.32s)]
*  The next morning, Ivan and his platoon reported to a company-wide formation at [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6104.08s)]
*  the training grounds. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6107.88s)]
*  There were obstacle courses and stations for machine gunners, snipers, and [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6109.68s)]
*  RPG gunners. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6112.96s)]
*  Ivan had assumed that there would be specialists conducting the training for [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6114.88s)]
*  the different activities. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6117.84s)]
*  But instead, Colonel S tasked him with teaching his own men most of it. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6119.4400000000005s)]
*  Ivan had never been in the infantry, but [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6124.04s)]
*  he tried to remember what he could from the academy. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6126.16s)]
*  He taught his men how to run, how to shoot and cover. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6129.0s)]
*  Keep the shooting constant. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6132.16s)]
*  When you take a position, try to shoot single shots so [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6133.68s)]
*  that you don't use up ammo quickly, so that the enemy keeps his head down. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6136.32s)]
*  There's no difference between firing three rounds in one. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6140.5599999999995s)]
*  Periodically, without aiming, just shoot once. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6143.679999999999s)]
*  Ivan drilled with every man he had. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6147.12s)]
*  This had nothing to do with patriotism or [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6149.4s)]
*  benevolence, it was all in the service of self-preservation. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6151.12s)]
*  Each one of them could end up being by my side in a fight and [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6155.32s)]
*  making the difference to my life. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6158.16s)]
*  But the opportunities for practice were abysmal. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6160.5199999999995s)]
*  While the Ukrainians actually trained with their American javelins, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6163.5199999999995s)]
*  the Russians treated their missiles like treasure. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6166.959999999999s)]
*  Ivan heard that the anti-tank specialists got to train on one only once. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6169.839999999999s)]
*  He was told that a single mortar cost 500,000 rubles, roughly $5,500. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6174.639999999999s)]
*  Later, Ivan saw a specialist totally miss his shot and [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6180.44s)]
*  cost everyone their cover. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6183.36s)]
*  The Ukrainians hit back and ten Russian soldiers were killed. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6185.48s)]
*  But as the butcher was known to quip before an operation, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6189.599999999999s)]
*  the female reproductive organ will bear more children, but the rocket is expensive. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6193.08s)]
*  The Russian military remained the Russian military, no matter the location. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6199.16s)]
*  Ivan found that he was always being called somewhere to write a report, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6204.16s)]
*  attend some meeting, stand in a formation. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6207.5599999999995s)]
*  Useless tasks as if they were on their boring base in Russia, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6210.64s)]
*  not five kilometers from death on a stranger's land. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6214.5199999999995s)]
*  It was always raining or miserable. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6218.04s)]
*  Ivan was constantly trekking through mud and puddles. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6220.68s)]
*  It was impossible to remove the grime from his boots. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6223.92s)]
*  Still, he made it a point never to complain. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6227.0s)]
*  Got it, he chirped. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6229.64s)]
*  That's right, Comrade Colonel. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6231.280000000001s)]
*  He answered every request, attended every formation, kissed every ass he had to. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6233.360000000001s)]
*  My life depends on me right now. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6238.240000000001s)]
*  It's clear what sabotage leads to. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6240.56s)]
*  The basement pits were never far from anyone's mind. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6243.4800000000005s)]
*  A few weeks passed before they were told to pack up. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6247.16s)]
*  They would be going to join their new units. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6250.88s)]
*  The buyers were coming back and the guys gathered their kit. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6253.32s)]
*  Scouts drove in and looked them over. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6256.92s)]
*  Are you Captain- [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6259.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, Ivan said. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6260.4s)]
*  First Battalion, the scout shouted, and Ivan climbed into the carrier. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6263.96s)]
*  The town they arrived in looked as though it had been a nice place. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6270.12s)]
*  The kind Ivan would have loved to visit in peacetime. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6273.6s)]
*  People had taken care of their homes and gardens. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6276.96s)]
*  They grew grapes on canopies over their carports. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6279.68s)]
*  Now the whole place was pockmarked by battle. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6283.120000000001s)]
*  Houses leaning sideways, fences collapsing, roofs shattered by shells. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6286.320000000001s)]
*  The Russians didn't know or didn't care about the street names. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6292.360000000001s)]
*  They called them by numbers. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6295.68s)]
*  First, second, third. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6297.52s)]
*  Ivan was directed to head along First Street to command headquarters. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6299.4s)]
*  The road was marked by a tank that was wrecked when the Russians drove it over [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6305.12s)]
*  a pile of their own mines. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6308.48s)]
*  As he walked, he picked up an apple from the ground and bit into it. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6310.799999999999s)]
*  It tasted so sweet. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6314.12s)]
*  He saw a familiar face, a sergeant from his base, call sign Fiend. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6316.04s)]
*  Fiend recognized him too. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6320.719999999999s)]
*  They greeted each other enthusiastically. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6322.759999999999s)]
*  It was nice to run into someone from home. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6325.28s)]
*  Fiend showed Ivan around a dilapidated house the soldiers had occupied. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6326.96s)]
*  They sat in the kitchen. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6332.88s)]
*  Rations wrappers and half-open containers the soldiers had taken from [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6334.44s)]
*  the village cellars lay on the table. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6337.6s)]
*  Between onions sat a grenade. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6340.4s)]
*  Ivan took a photo with his phone, amused by the oddity of his new reality. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6342.76s)]
*  Everyone was smoking, lazing around on the floor. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6347.72s)]
*  They explained that they had nothing to do but wait. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6350.92s)]
*  What if a shell hits this house, Ivan asked? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6354.12s)]
*  You could at least sit in the basement. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6356.64s)]
*  It's a roulette, they replied. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6358.88s)]
*  There have been cases where people hid in basements. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6361.04s)]
*  The mortars didn't hit you, but they hit the concrete foundations and kill you anyway. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6363.76s)]
*  Nah, I'll probably sleep in the basement, Ivan decided. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6368.68s)]
*  He went to have a look. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6372.200000000001s)]
*  Ten feet away from the basement entrance, a grad was stuck in the ground. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6373.76s)]
*  The men were sleeping next to an unexploded rocket. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6377.92s)]
*  There's a toilet there, but don't use it or it may detonate, the guys called to him. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6381.280000000001s)]
*  Back at the table, Fiends started explaining the setup. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6384.84s)]
*  The battalion's headquarters were across the street. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6389.52s)]
*  Although they were supposed to be a specialized reconnaissance unit, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6392.52s)]
*  they were now in charge of initial assaults, the first group to take territory. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6395.68s)]
*  It had turned into a bloodbath. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6400.4800000000005s)]
*  For months, they had been trying to take a windbreak in the rolling farmland that [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6402.6s)]
*  everyone called the boot for its shape. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6406.04s)]
*  By early October, they had already been repelled half a dozen times and [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6408.84s)]
*  taken a lot of casualties. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6412.360000000001s)]
*  They knew they would make another attempt, they just didn't know when. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6414.56s)]
*  The boot was heavily fortified. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6418.56s)]
*  The Ukrainians had dug extensive tunnels. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6420.88s)]
*  It's fucked there, a guy who survived the last offensive told Ivan. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6423.56s)]
*  It's not like you just walk in and that's it. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6427.52s)]
*  There are a ton of guys sitting down there. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6429.92s)]
*  Their commander, whose call sign began with an L, so we'll call him Lion, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6433.4800000000005s)]
*  was another man Ivan knew from home. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6437.6s)]
*  Lion had been a tanker, but ended up as a commanding officer in infantry. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6440.360000000001s)]
*  He left their base in August as a major and [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6444.54s)]
*  was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his time in the SVO. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6446.86s)]
*  At the base, he had been an asshole. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6450.9s)]
*  But the guys agreed that as far as commanders who stayed safe in the rear [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6452.84s)]
*  trenches go, Lion was a good one. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6456.26s)]
*  He pushed back against his superiors when he was given stupid orders. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6459.66s)]
*  Fiend relayed a story in which Lion refused to send his men forward [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6463.74s)]
*  during one assault on the boot. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6467.14s)]
*  There's no option, Lion shouted. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6469.34s)]
*  It's a meat grinder there. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6471.3s)]
*  The guys believed that they had been punished for [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6473.26s)]
*  Lion's intransigent refusals. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6475.1s)]
*  Assigned to worse patrols at the point of contact, but they didn't mind. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6477.38s)]
*  At least their commander didn't think of them as trash. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6481.860000000001s)]
*  By the spring, Lion would be dead. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6484.74s)]
*  Ivan headed to the command HQ to officially receive instructions. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6488.18s)]
*  Lion was in the basement, the walls covered in rugs. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6492.18s)]
*  I'm here, Ivan reported. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6495.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, Lion looked him over. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6497.9800000000005s)]
*  You can't get the fuck out now, can you? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6500.1s)]
*  That's right, Ivan replied. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6502.62s)]
*  Lion passed him a list of his platoon personnel and dismissed him. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6505.14s)]
*  Ivan asked his new deputy to collect the rest of the men who were living all over [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6509.0599999999995s)]
*  the village. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6512.34s)]
*  It took an hour to assemble everyone. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6513.46s)]
*  When his 30 men lined up, Ivan learned they were all contractniki. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6515.74s)]
*  Ivan addressed them. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6520.5s)]
*  Okay, men, let's work. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6521.86s)]
*  Let me say right off the bat that I have no combat experience. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6523.62s)]
*  We'll get it together. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6527.42s)]
*  Whoever has combat experience, step out and tell me about it. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6529.14s)]
*  One man stepped forward. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6533.3s)]
*  His call sign was student. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6534.900000000001s)]
*  He had fought before in one of the southern wars of Ivan's childhood. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6536.9800000000005s)]
*  He was a machine gunner there. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6540.38s)]
*  Are you ready, Ivan asked him? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6542.700000000001s)]
*  Yes, I'm ready. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6544.58s)]
*  You'll help me if I need it. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6546.1s)]
*  Yes. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6547.900000000001s)]
*  The assembly was over. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6549.58s)]
*  The guys explained that over near a fence there was a can. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6551.38s)]
*  If you put your phone on the can, sometimes you could catch cell reception. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6554.46s)]
*  Ivan went over, opened WhatsApp and messaged Anna, 103. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6558.66s)]
*  It hadn't taken Anna long to quit her job, leave the base and [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6564.94s)]
*  move home to her family after Ivan's deployment. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6568.42s)]
*  She started trying to renovate their apartment to give herself something to do. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6571.86s)]
*  Before Ivan left, he removed his wedding ring and [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6575.86s)]
*  gave it to Anna for safekeeping. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6578.22s)]
*  She wore it on a chain around her neck like a talisman. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6580.62s)]
*  As the child of a deployed officer, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6582.9s)]
*  Sasha was placed into a good daycare right next to their apartment. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6585.0599999999995s)]
*  They could have their pick of any in the city and Anna chose the closest one. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6589.66s)]
*  It disgusted her when the other parents fawned over them during pickup and [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6594.94s)]
*  drop off. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6598.099999999999s)]
*  She avoided their attempts at conversation. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6599.339999999999s)]
*  Anna kept her phone on her at all times with the volume all the way up. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6602.66s)]
*  It was always charged. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6606.5s)]
*  She continued to watch telegram channels and [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6608.42s)]
*  contact groups about Ivan's case. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6610.62s)]
*  She corresponded most with an organization called Edite Lessem, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6613.339999999999s)]
*  which worked specifically to help service members escape. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6617.099999999999s)]
*  The group's name could translate as Get Lost, Go Fuck Yourself, or [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6620.62s)]
*  Go By The Forest. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6624.42s)]
*  It was started by Grigori Svairdlin, an exile from St. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6626.58s)]
*  Petersburg who had fled the war and gone to Tbilisi, Georgia. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6629.82s)]
*  Svairdlin graduated from college as a reserve officer, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6633.94s)]
*  the same method that Defense Minister Shoigu employed to avoid actual service. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6637.139999999999s)]
*  And had the idea for the project within days of the mobilization. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6641.74s)]
*  He wanted to find a way to help people not go to war. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6645.82s)]
*  It was a way to take civic action, to prevent Ukrainian deaths and [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6649.46s)]
*  the Russian army's atrocities, as well as to save Russian lives. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6653.42s)]
*  If they were all guilty of paving the way to this war, [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6658.26s)]
*  they could at least atone by trying to prevent the greatest amount of harm. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6661.34s)]
*  When he announced the idea on social media, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6666.38s)]
*  Svairdlin immediately received hundreds of replies and volunteers. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6668.74s)]
*  Designers, IT people, psychologists, lawyers, people who had cars and [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6672.46s)]
*  offered to drive deserters, those who wanted to contribute money to help [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6677.0199999999995s)]
*  evacuate those who didn't want to fight. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6680.42s)]
*  Messages poured in. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6682.9s)]
*  I live near the border with Kazakhstan and I know how to bypass the checkpoint. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6684.78s)]
*  Please keep my contacts, but delete all the messages. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6688.62s)]
*  Within a week, Edite Lessem had developed a database of information [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6692.26s)]
*  about the rights of service members, the mobilized and their families. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6696.1s)]
*  Advising people on how to avoid their draft papers and how to leave the country. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6700.1s)]
*  Edite Lessem had helped junior officers escape Russia, but [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6704.740000000001s)]

*  Anna lived from one phone call to the next. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6711.900000000001s)]
*  She slept 15 minutes at a time, 15 minutes of sleep and then awake. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6714.700000000001s)]
*  15 minutes of sleep and then awake. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6719.42s)]
*  In her dreams, there was only Ivan, only war and only death. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6722.22s)]
*  She started scratching her wrists and ankles. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6726.62s)]
*  They were covered in blood. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6729.18s)]
*  They would scar and shimmer like burns. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6730.780000000001s)]
*  The guys in Ivan's platoon were, as he put it, decent men. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6735.34s)]
*  They had all picked their own call signs when Ivan passed around a sheet of paper. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6739.18s)]
*  Among them were Bareblood, the deputy platoon leader and first squad commander. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6743.54s)]

*  Hunter, paddle, shepherd and tin man, rifleman. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6759.02s)]
*  Richlake, the medic. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6762.62s)]
*  When Ivan talked to them, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6765.38s)]
*  they explained that they hadn't been dragged there against their will. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6766.42s)]
*  Some were career enlisted. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6769.860000000001s)]
*  Others signed three month contracts, thinking they could make some money and [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6771.860000000001s)]
*  go home. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6775.18s)]
*  After signing, they were told to report back the next morning for [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6776.54s)]
*  transport to the SVO. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6779.5s)]
*  They never even met the commander of the base they were assigned to. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6781.66s)]
*  None had received the training they were promised. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6784.86s)]
*  Ivan couldn't believe they chose to be there. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6788.14s)]
*  You do realize you can die in a war, he asked. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6791.26s)]
*  This isn't a job where your failure is your termination. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6794.3s)]
*  Your failure in the army is your death. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6797.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they replied. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6800.42s)]
*  They told Ivan that they fought in another man's war for [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6802.5s)]
*  the economic well-being of their children. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6805.22s)]
*  After a while, as more and more of their comrades were killed, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6807.02s)]
*  that war would become theirs as well. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6810.540000000001s)]
*  It was more than just the money. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6812.9400000000005s)]
*  The government promised that their children could be admitted into schools [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6814.780000000001s)]
*  normally reserved for those with high marks, bribes, or connections. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6817.740000000001s)]
*  Back home, Shepherd was a rancher. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6822.540000000001s)]
*  He bred sheep and horses. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6824.820000000001s)]
*  It paid well, about 400,000 rubles, $4,400 a month in profits, [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6826.580000000001s)]
*  which was four times what Ivan made. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6831.700000000001s)]
*  Shepherd explained that he had five children and eight sisters and brothers. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6834.02s)]
*  He made a decent living, but he organized weddings for [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6838.02s)]
*  his siblings and helped their children. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6841.02s)]
*  Now, one of his daughters was trying to get into the police academy. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6843.02s)]
*  Shepherd explained to Ivan that he had been told it would be much easier for [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6847.02s)]
*  her to get in if he was at the SVO. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6850.02s)]
*  Three months for her whole future. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6853.02s)]
*  The mobilization had put an end to these ideas. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6858.02s)]
*  Now, every kontratnik was obliged to serve until the end of wartime conditions, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6861.02s)]
*  which could continue indefinitely. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6865.02s)]
*  The platoon got along fine. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6868.02s)]
*  When someone went to town to buy something, he brought back extras for [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6870.02s)]
*  the rest of the men. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6874.02s)]
*  People would drop by and grab coffee or a cookie and talk. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6875.02s)]
*  They didn't have much else to do. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6878.02s)]
*  Humanitarian parcels were often passed through Lyon's basement, [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6880.02s)]
*  though they had already been picked over by others along the way. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6884.02s)]
*  The good stuff never made it to the front line. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6887.02s)]
*  Instead, they got chocolates and socks, and sometimes they got postcards from [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6890.02s)]
*  school children who wrote to them during patriotic lessons. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6894.02s)]
*  Ivan took one to his kitchen of grenades and onions and pinned it up on the wall. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6898.02s)]
*  Soldier, come home, it said, accompanied by a child's drawing. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6903.02s)]
*  Remember, we're waiting for you. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6907.02s)]
*  He thought it might cheer someone up, but when he looked at it, he just felt empty. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6910.02s)]
*  It wasn't long before Ivan was summoned back to Lyon's basement and shown drone [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6914.02s)]
*  footage of the boot. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6918.02s)]
*  They could see the trench full of Ukrainians in the frames. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6919.02s)]
*  Lyon told them that the two companies had been assigned different segments of the boot. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6923.02s)]
*  One company would move first, then the other like a pincer to force the Ukrainians to [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6927.02s)]
*  retreat through the middle. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6931.02s)]
*  Lyon's three platoons would divide their section into three parts and do the same [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6933.02s)]
*  pincer move on a smaller scale. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6937.02s)]
*  Ivan and his three squad leaders rewatched the drone footage more closely. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6939.02s)]
*  The ground was scorched from past battles, and overturned armored personnel carriers [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6943.02s)]

*  Ivan and his deputies agreed that they would run in shooting, throw a grenade at the [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6959.02s)]
*  Ukrainians, and then go to the front line. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6963.02s)]

*  Ukrainian trench, take the point and wait for reinforcements. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6977.02s)]
*  It wasn't a brilliant strategy, but Lyon didn't care. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6981.02s)]
*  They just had to advance. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6984.02s)]
*  Ninety lives for two miles of earth. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6986.02s)]
*  Previous attempts to take the boot had been on foot. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6990.02s)]
*  They had a tank which would clear the mines with a visor that dragged on the ground [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6993.02s)]
*  and raise the topsoil. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6996.02s)]
*  Command said the men would walk behind it. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=6998.02s)]
*  If it snagged a mine, the vehicle would take the impact. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7000.02s)]
*  Everyone agreed it was idiotic, like banging your spoon on your plate and yelling [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7003.02s)]
*  to the Ukrainians, I'm here, I'm here. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7007.02s)]
*  They had two days to train, so they went back to the range. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7011.02s)]
*  During one practice, they were told to line up in formation. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7014.02s)]
*  The general, in charge of their entire operational direction, strode out to address [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7018.02s)]
*  them. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7022.02s)]
*  Comrades, we've got to get the boot, he began, leaning against a tree with his hands [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7023.02s)]
*  on his stomach. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7027.02s)]
*  I know exactly how you feel. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7029.02s)]
*  I have a son in the Airborne. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7031.02s)]
*  I was storming a forest the other day, ran into a wooded area just like this myself. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7033.02s)]
*  He told them not to worry. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7038.02s)]
*  Another company would come in from the right side. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7040.02s)]
*  We're going to have artillery like you've never seen in your lives. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7043.02s)]
*  There will be thirteen tanks. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7045.02s)]
*  You're going to be covered from all sides. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7047.02s)]
*  Reconnaissance reported that there are no more than fifteen people in this forest belt. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7049.02s)]
*  There are only mobilized men guarding it. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7053.02s)]
*  Don't worry, they're even more afraid than we are. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7056.02s)]
*  They'll run away as soon as they see you. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7059.02s)]
*  Ivan knew this was a lie. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7062.02s)]
*  Their own drones had shown them the troop strength and the extensive tunnel system. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7064.02s)]
*  He knew from school that any stronghold should be attacked by two hundred and eighty [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7069.02s)]
*  artillery shells, not fired just in the general area, but at an actual target. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7073.02s)]
*  And only after that would the infantry, at three times the defense's strength, go on the offensive. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7079.02s)]
*  Ivan had watched the YouTube videos of the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade of Ukraine, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7085.02s)]
*  formerly known as Azov. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7089.02s)]
*  He saw how real warriors took territory, the ones who were fighting to liberate it. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7091.02s)]
*  But Ivan didn't want any territory. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7096.02s)]
*  He didn't want to do a particularly good job. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7098.02s)]
*  He wanted to find a hole to sit in. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7101.02s)]
*  The main thing was just to survive. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7103.02s)]
*  The night before the operation, Ivan prepared his supplies. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7107.02s)]
*  He took apart all the magazines, wiped down the springs, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7111.02s)]
*  oiled them and carefully hung all the grenades in the proper way. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7114.02s)]
*  He put extra ammunition in his backpack, along with his first aid kit. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7118.02s)]
*  He distributed medical supplies to his squad leaders. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7122.02s)]
*  They would leave their phones in Lyon's basement in a bag, so no one could see their geolocation. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7125.02s)]
*  Before Ivan handed his phone in, he sent Anna a message. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7131.02s)]
*  102. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7135.02s)]
*  When Anna got the message, she remembered a video she saw online of a psychologist [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7138.02s)]
*  who said that we go crazy the moment we allow ourselves to go crazy. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7143.02s)]
*  She told herself that Sasha couldn't lose two parents at once. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7148.02s)]
*  Take yourself in your hands. You have a mission. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7152.02s)]
*  She grabbed herself, slapping herself on the cheeks. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7156.02s)]
*  Without that, she would stay still, looking at the same point on the wall like being submerged in water. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7159.02s)]
*  Sasha was worried, clearly aware that something wasn't right. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7166.02s)]
*  For that, Anna beat herself more. If Ivan had to survive, so did they. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7170.02s)]
*  She scrolled the news on Telegram endlessly. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7176.02s)]
*  Russians were on the retreat and the defensive. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7179.02s)]
*  That month, General Sergei Serovikin, previously known as the Butcher of Syria, [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7182.02s)]
*  had been named Russia's overall commander in Ukraine. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7187.02s)]
*  Serovikin had a reputation for efficiency and brutality. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7190.02s)]
*  Under his command, the Russians began constructing what would come to be known as the Serovikin Line, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7194.02s)]
*  miles of concrete pyramids known as dragon's teeth, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7200.02s)]
*  and deep ditches called tank traps for the defense of their supply lines. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7204.02s)]
*  They would build miles of trenches with pillboxes, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7208.02s)]
*  small fortifications that their troops could shoot from. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7211.02s)]
*  The newly mobilized would be put to work. Units could rotate, even rest. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7214.02s)]
*  There would be reinforcements from men like Ivan. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7219.02s)]
*  The commander of Ukraine's armed forces, General Valeriy Zoluzhny, stated bluntly, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7222.02s)]
*  Russian mobilization has worked. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7227.02s)]
*  It is not true that their problems are so dire that these people will not fight. They will. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7230.02s)]
*  But the mobilization had also awakened the ire of some of the most sympathetic quarters of society. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7236.02s)]
*  Women. Mothers of newly enlisted conscripts, wives of mobilized men, [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7242.02s)]
*  gathered on telegram groups to coordinate humanitarian packages. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7248.02s)]
*  Memories of the mothers of conscripts from the Chechen War, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7252.02s)]
*  who moved like ghouls in the dark of the eastern Caucasus mountains, [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7255.02s)]
*  looking for the bodies of their sons, were hard to erase from the national psyche. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7259.02s)]
*  The Kremlin worried that these women would eventually take to the streets. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7264.02s)]
*  They were active. They wrote to their governors, to their mayors, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7268.02s)]
*  to the Committee of Soldiers Mothers, to the president's office, [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7271.02s)]
*  to Defense Minister Shoigu, begging for their husbands and sons to be returned. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7274.02s)]
*  Anna drove herself to exhaustion, sourcing humanitarian packages for Ivan. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7280.02s)]
*  She contacted everyone she could to collect money for his parcels. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7285.02s)]
*  When he told her he needed a thermal night vision scope, [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7289.02s)]
*  Anna started looking for it everywhere. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7291.02s)]
*  She was not the only wife trying to supply her husband at the front. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7293.02s)]
*  Everything near her was sold out. Everything was expensive. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7297.02s)]
*  She found one for sale in Moscow and contacted a girlfriend there. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7301.02s)]
*  Neither of them had any idea what a thermal night vision scope even was. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7305.02s)]
*  It looks legitimate, she reported back to Anna. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7309.02s)]
*  Or at least like a tube you can look through. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7312.02s)]
*  When Ivan called her and told her that everything was fine, [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7315.02s)]
*  she knew he was lying because he periodically sent pictures. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7318.02s)]
*  She watched as Ivan shrank to half his former size. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7321.02s)]
*  They didn't discuss it, but she knew he sent the pictures to help her geolocate his body. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7325.02s)]
*  So many Russian women did not know where their husbands died. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7330.02s)]
*  Anna knew she didn't decide. She knew that if Ivan were killed, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7334.02s)]
*  she would go there herself to collect his remains. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7338.02s)]
*  She would not let him rot in pieces in some sunflower field. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7341.02s)]
*  At 0500, the company arrived at its position and waited. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7348.02s)]
*  Ivan saw Spicey, the second platoon leader, who would take the middle of the belt. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7352.02s)]
*  Well, see you tonight, Spicey told him. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7357.02s)]
*  Yeah, see you later. They shook hands. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7360.02s)]
*  Guys, it's gonna be okay, Ivan told his platoon as they waited. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7363.02s)]
*  We've been practicing. Everything's gonna be fine. Don't panic. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7367.02s)]
*  If you have any questions, tell me right away. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7372.02s)]
*  The main thing to remember is to cover each other. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7375.02s)]
*  The most important thing is not to panic. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7378.02s)]
*  Do not panic. Panic is the enemy on the battlefield. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7380.02s)]
*  Everyone sat there, breathing out, waiting for the sounds of the other company moving in. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7384.02s)]
*  But it was silent. I couldn't understand where everyone was. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7391.02s)]
*  Lion radioed Ivan to advance anyway, and Ivan passed the command down the line. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7396.02s)]
*  The tank, followed by an infantry fighting vehicle, rolled loudly into open territory. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7402.02s)]
*  They were less than a mile from the Ukrainian position. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7407.02s)]
*  Spicey's platoon was moving too. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7410.02s)]
*  Ivan could hear the men shooting from their tank. No one fired back. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7413.02s)]
*  Everyone stopped and dismounted. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7416.02s)]
*  Immediately they came under fire. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7419.02s)]
*  Everyone down, Ivan shouted. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7421.02s)]
*  There was a machine gunner shooting from the Ukrainian stronghold. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7423.02s)]
*  The Russians returned fire. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7426.02s)]
*  Ivan's deputy, Bareblood, was holding his hand, screaming. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7428.02s)]
*  Part of his finger had been blown off. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7431.02s)]
*  Down, Ivan shouted. Don't move. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7433.02s)]
*  Old man went to work. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7436.02s)]
*  He fired the RPG straight into the Ukrainian stronghold. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7438.02s)]
*  It exploded, and it was quiet, except for the radio. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7442.02s)]
*  Spicey is 200, it blared. Spicey is 200. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7446.02s)]
*  It had been about five minutes since the offensive started. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7450.02s)]
*  The guy Ivan had just shaken hands with. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7454.02s)]
*  They had been 50 yards apart. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7457.02s)]
*  From Ivan's vantage point on the ground, it looked nothing like the drone footage he studied back in the basement with his squad leaders. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7459.02s)]
*  He could see only the trees, no landmarks, no black dirt, no water towers or high points. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7467.02s)]
*  The earth began to burst. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7473.02s)]
*  Then there was a double sound that Ivan didn't register until he saw something tough the earth five meters ahead of him. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7476.02s)]
*  A splash, then another, moving toward him like stones skimming a lake in reverse. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7482.02s)]
*  A sniper was working on him. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7487.02s)]
*  He turned and saw a crater. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7489.02s)]
*  He crawled backward until he tumbled down into the hole. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7491.02s)]
*  Ivan looked around and saw a handful of others from his platoon also hiding in the crater. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7494.02s)]
*  The hole was huge, created by a bomb roughly 10 feet deep and 20 feet in diameter. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7499.02s)]
*  The radio screamed periodically. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7505.02s)]
*  This one's 300. This one's 200. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7508.02s)]
*  We need an evacuation right away. Urgent. Help. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7511.02s)]
*  They had changed all their call signs before the offensive in case the Ukrainians had been bugging them. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7515.02s)]
*  It was Lyon's directive. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7521.02s)]
*  And instead of 200s and 300s, they should call them Xs and Os. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7523.02s)]
*  But in the end, it didn't matter. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7527.02s)]
*  Everyone was screaming as usual. 200, 300. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7529.02s)]
*  When Ivan poked his head out of the crater, he could see Apricot, a machine gunner, Fiend, second squad leader, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7533.02s)]
*  Bare-blood, deputy platoon leader, tin man, the senior rifleman, all lying there. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7540.02s)]
*  He saw someone running toward their crater, totally upright despite the sniper's bullets, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7545.02s)]
*  and leaping through the air for the final steps. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7550.02s)]
*  At the last moment, there was a grimace of pain on his face. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7553.02s)]
*  Ivan watched it all as if it were in a slow motion film. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7557.02s)]
*  I'm hurt, Achilles shouted as he landed. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7561.02s)]
*  He was hit in the back. His pelvic bone shattered. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7563.02s)]
*  They started bandaging him. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7567.02s)]
*  They stayed in that crater for an hour or a few minutes. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7569.02s)]
*  They didn't know how long. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7572.02s)]
*  Thinking about what to do, hoping for backup. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7574.02s)]
*  I have two 200s, Ivan called for support. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7577.02s)]
*  There are 300s and a heavy 300. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7580.02s)]
*  A Ukrainian tank broke out of the treeline, firing, hitting somewhere near them, retreating somewhere. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7583.02s)]
*  And then it was quiet again. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7589.02s)]
*  Ivan looked out and radioed what he thought were the tank's coordinates. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7591.02s)]
*  The Russians fired from behind Ivan with an automatic grenade launcher and missed. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7595.02s)]
*  Twenty meters right, Ivan corrected. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7599.02s)]
*  They kept firing. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7602.02s)]
*  Ivan kept adjusting, but the Russian efforts kept failing. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7603.02s)]
*  They were just totally inept, wasting opportunities. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7607.02s)]
*  Each time Ivan had to figure out the adjustment, he stuck his head out of the foxhole, playing whack-a-mole with the sniper. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7610.02s)]
*  It would be a dark comedy if the punchline weren't Ivan's life. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7617.02s)]
*  Half an hour went by. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7621.02s)]
*  A dozen attempts, until it was clear that it was useless to keep taking the risk. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7623.02s)]
*  What began as an obviously bad idea would grow ever more absurd. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7628.02s)]
*  Achilles started to turn pale. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7633.02s)]
*  No one had thought to check him for an exit wound. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7635.02s)]
*  When the men turned him over, it was right there on his stomach. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7638.02s)]
*  Ivan pulled out hemostatic powder that Anna had sent him and poured a ton of it in the hole where the bullet came out. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7641.02s)]
*  With gauze on top, they pressed down hard. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7647.02s)]
*  I need a fucking evacuation, Ivan kept shouting on the radio. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7650.02s)]
*  Go back on the fucking offensive line, radioed. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7654.02s)]
*  They must have been there for hours when they saw the Ukrainian drone. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7657.02s)]
*  The Russians started shooting at it. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7661.02s)]
*  The drone dropped its munitions ten feet from their hole. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7663.02s)]
*  They managed to knock it down, but they knew they had been spotted. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7666.02s)]
*  Where's the trophy money I was promised, one of the men joked? [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7670.02s)]
*  Go get it and bring it back to me, Ivan replied, and I'll put it in order. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7673.02s)]
*  At least they still had their sense of humor. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7678.02s)]
*  A voice above called to Ivan. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7681.02s)]
*  He poked his head out of the hole. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7684.02s)]
*  It was Student, the second machine gunner. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7686.02s)]
*  He was 20 feet away, pinned down by his heavy backpack and couldn't cut off the strap. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7688.02s)]
*  One of his arms was mangled. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7693.02s)]
*  They had two options. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7695.02s)]
*  Get Student from above and risk the snipers or dig a trench toward him. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7697.02s)]
*  Dig, Ivan shouted at his men. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7701.02s)]
*  They dug for hours trying to make ridges and shelters out of the ground, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7704.02s)]
*  but the earth kept crumbling in. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7708.02s)]
*  They dug a ten-foot trench, but the more they dug, the more it crumbled. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7710.02s)]
*  They were tired. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7714.02s)]
*  They hadn't eaten. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7715.02s)]
*  It was already the afternoon, and they had set out 12 hours ago. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7716.02s)]
*  A man could die, Ivan commanded. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7720.02s)]
*  Let's keep digging. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7723.02s)]
*  They stopped to take stock and realized that the digging had made their own hole smaller. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7724.02s)]
*  As the dirt fell into their crater, they were raising themselves up to level ground. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7729.02s)]
*  It was like a cartoon. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7733.02s)]
*  Guys, let's stop, Ivan commanded. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7735.02s)]
*  We're going to dig ourselves to the surface. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7738.02s)]
*  Their water had run out. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7741.02s)]
*  All they had left were cigarettes. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7743.02s)]
*  It felt as if they were smoking one a minute. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7745.02s)]
*  Everything they touched was clawing at their throats. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7748.02s)]
*  Somebody had some candy. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7751.02s)]
*  They passed it around until it was gone. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7753.02s)]
*  They had no idea what to do next. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7755.02s)]
*  They made a rope out of their belts. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7758.02s)]
*  Old man volunteered to run out and clip in Student with Ivan's carabiner, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7760.02s)]
*  and then they could all drag him into the crater. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7764.02s)]
*  Old man crawled over to Student, and for some reason he decided to inject him with Premadol right there. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7767.02s)]
*  The powerful anti-pain drug that the Russians were given at the front was known to relax people. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7773.02s)]
*  It made Student floppy and impossible to drag. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7778.02s)]
*  As they struggled to heave him, the sniper started again. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7781.02s)]
*  Old man ran back and jumped in the crater. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7784.02s)]
*  When he stood up, his pants were hanging low off his body. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7787.02s)]
*  His jacket and belt were split in half. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7790.02s)]
*  The sniper's bullet had skimmed him. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7793.02s)]
*  Dumb luck was their only savior. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7795.02s)]
*  Attack, Lion continued to radio. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7797.02s)]
*  Attack! [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7799.02s)]
*  Guys, we got to do something, Ivan said to the men. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7801.02s)]
*  I can't just ignore orders from command. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7803.02s)]
*  They will lock me up if I go back. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7805.02s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7807.02s)]
*  Everyone knew that there were snipers out there, and that if they left the hole, one of them would surely die. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7808.02s)]
*  Let's pretend we are attacking, one of them offered. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7813.02s)]
*  You go on the radio and talk as if we are attacking and we will shoot from inside here. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7816.02s)]
*  Let's do it, Ivan decided. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7820.02s)]
*  Everyone here in favor of this story? [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7822.02s)]
*  Do you understand what we are doing right now? [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7824.02s)]
*  Everyone agreed. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7826.02s)]
*  Is everyone clear, Ivan repeated. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7828.02s)]
*  We all say the same thing. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7830.02s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7832.02s)]
*  Ivan got on the radio. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7833.02s)]
*  I'm attacking. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7835.02s)]
*  We're advancing. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7836.02s)]
*  We're advancing. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7837.02s)]
*  All of them pointed their weapons out of the crater and started firing rounds in the air. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7838.02s)]
*  I'm attacking, Ivan shouted through their ears. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7842.02s)]
*  We're advancing. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7845.02s)]
*  We're advancing. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7846.02s)]
*  I'm trying to move out. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7847.02s)]
*  I can't get out and the enemy is firing. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7848.02s)]
*  There's a tank coming, Lion radioed. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7850.02s)]
*  Get behind the tank and follow the tank. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7852.02s)]
*  The Russian tank drove past Ivan's crater. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7854.02s)]
*  Is everybody ready, Ivan asked his men. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7857.02s)]
*  Let's at least fake it. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7860.02s)]
*  Stand up. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7861.02s)]
*  The men stood up and the tank let off a round. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7862.02s)]
*  All of them fell over from the bang. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7864.02s)]
*  The tank pulled back its turret right above the crater and from ten feet above their heads let off another round. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7866.02s)]
*  The men were deafened. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7872.02s)]
*  Everything inside their pit was shaking. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7873.02s)]
*  Little grains of sand jumping up as though gravity had been dismissed. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7876.02s)]
*  They grabbed their ears falling down even lower. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7880.02s)]
*  Slowly, Ivan heard voices more distinctly. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7883.02s)]
*  It was Lion on the radio again, screaming and cursing at them to advance. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7885.02s)]
*  I need an evacuation, Ivan shouted. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7889.02s)]
*  Moments later, explosions, sparks, smoke. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7892.02s)]
*  Ivan looked out of the crater and saw more men running toward the crater. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7896.02s)]
*  The evacuation vehicle had been blown up. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7900.02s)]
*  The commander of the evacuation group ended up in their hole too. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7902.02s)]
*  Come on, Ivan shouted at him. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7906.02s)]
*  Report from your side that the evacuation group was hit so that this comrade doesn't think we're just fucking around here. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7908.02s)]
*  The evacuation team has been hit. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7914.02s)]
*  We need a way out. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7916.02s)]
*  We have a lot of wounded. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7917.02s)]
*  Ivan decided he had had enough. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7919.02s)]
*  If no one came to help them, they would wait until dark and move back. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7921.02s)]
*  We're getting out, he radioed Lion. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7925.02s)]
*  Don't leave without the 200s, came the reply. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7927.02s)]
*  If you leave them, you're going back to retrieve them. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7929.02s)]
*  After the sunset, the soldiers crawled out of the hole. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7933.02s)]
*  They each grabbed a wounded man and took turns dragging everyone back. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7937.02s)]
*  They left the dead, Apricot and an engineer who had been attached to the platoon a few days earlier for the operation because they didn't have enough hands. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7941.02s)]
*  Ivan crawled all the way back. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7950.02s)]
*  The dirt and the blood were all over the place. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7952.02s)]
*  Ivan crawled all the way back, the dirt and the rocks shredding the knee pads off his uniform. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7955.02s)]
*  He turned and saw that some of the men had disregarded reason. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7960.02s)]
*  Despite at least two snipers, they walked upright without helmets. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7964.02s)]
*  Ivan, who always wanted to survive just a little bit more, kept crawling. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7968.02s)]
*  In the safety of their rear trenches, as far from the front as you could get and still be near the point of contact, Lion had the luxury of fury. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7973.02s)]
*  Why did you leave the 200s? [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7984.02s)]
*  He demanded of Ivan. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7986.02s)]
*  You bastard, I should lock you up. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7987.02s)]
*  Fucking pussy. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7989.02s)]
*  Ivan just listened. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7991.02s)]
*  He knew it was important for the widows to have proof of their husband's bodies to try to collect the coffin payment or to have peace of mind. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=7992.02s)]
*  Otherwise, the state could and probably would declare them deserters and try to deny the women the payouts it promised. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8000.02s)]
*  But Ivan had no regrets. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8007.02s)]
*  He had to save the lives he could. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8009.02s)]
*  He also didn't think that was why Lion was so worked up about it. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8011.02s)]
*  Battalion commanders must get some kind of penalty for leaving bodies behind. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8015.02s)]
*  When Lion finished cursing Ivan out, he told him that his platoon would be going to support the third platoon led by Soviet, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8020.02s)]
*  who had taken the territory they were supposed to. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8028.02s)]
*  No sleep, no food, just more walking and fighting. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8031.02s)]
*  Yes, Comrade Colonel, Ivan replied. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8035.02s)]
*  Ivan returned to his men and explained the situation. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8038.02s)]
*  Four of the men refused immediately, but Lion threatened them with arrest and they relented. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8042.02s)]
*  It was past midnight as they trekked through the darkness. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8047.02s)]
*  Ivan's back had started hurting. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8051.02s)]
*  They got to the trenches, dug near some trees, and bunked in for the night. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8053.02s)]
*  They hadn't eaten in twenty-four hours. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8057.02s)]
*  The third platoon shared some of their rations. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8060.02s)]
*  Ivan chewed a scrap of lard someone passed him and they lay down to sleep, huddling close to one another. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8063.02s)]
*  They were freezing. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8069.02s)]
*  Ivan woke up to a mouse biting his finger. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8071.02s)]
*  He was furious, not that the mouse was hurting him, but that it ended his slumber. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8074.02s)]
*  It was so cold that he couldn't fall back asleep. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8079.02s)]
*  It began to drizzle. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8082.02s)]
*  Though it was uncomfortable, the rain would make them less visible. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8084.02s)]
*  Ivan heard a buzzing overhead, and first no one realized what it was. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8088.02s)]
*  A quadcopter with a thermographic camera, which meant it could see them even though they were hidden under trees. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8093.02s)]
*  It could sense their heat and adjust a mortar. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8099.02s)]
*  Ivan had only heard that the Ukrainians had these. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8102.02s)]
*  His battalion didn't have anything like it. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8105.02s)]
*  Immediately they could hear the artillery exits, and the arrivals began falling around them. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8108.02s)]
*  It was carnage. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8113.02s)]
*  Wherever they ran, the explosions followed. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8115.02s)]
*  When a shell missed a direct hit, it hit the thicket of trees above them. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8117.02s)]
*  Branches splintered, and fragments of wood, earth, and metal engulfed them. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8121.02s)]
*  A man near Ivan started screaming, [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8125.02s)]
*  Arm! Arm! [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8127.02s)]
*  More screams. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8129.02s)]
*  As Ivan ran, he thought of Anna. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8130.02s)]
*  Imagine that all my love, all my tenderness for you, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8132.02s)]
*  It will be transformed into a protective balloon that will protect you from bullets, from explosions. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8136.02s)]
*  He could nearly see the dome's boundaries surrounding him as he ran at full speed. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8142.02s)]
*  Ivan saw nothing, felt nothing, until he tumbled down into a trench. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8148.02s)]
*  A shell slammed somewhere nearby inches from the opening. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8153.02s)]
*  A fragment hit the third platoon commander, ripping out his stomach. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8157.02s)]
*  Ivan was a few feet away. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8161.02s)]
*  He grabbed a soldier who was stumbling and started walking. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8163.02s)]
*  The rain had turned the road from clay to sludge. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8166.02s)]
*  It stuck to their feet. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8169.02s)]
*  Every step they took, their shoes getting heavier and heavier. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8171.02s)]
*  Between the grease, the body armor, the helmet, and the guy he was carrying, Ivan could barely move. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8174.02s)]
*  His back was hurting, and he began limping under the weight. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8180.02s)]
*  As he walked, Ivan started thinking. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8183.02s)]
*  In the first attack, just hours ago, he lost two men. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8185.02s)]
*  Now this. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8189.02s)]
*  Going back to Lyon again, what would happen? [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8190.02s)]
*  They'll say, you're resting one day. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8192.02s)]
*  Tomorrow we'll attack again. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8194.02s)]
*  Ivan's back was twinging. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8196.02s)]
*  He knew a guy back at the base, Roman, whose herniated disc had gotten so bad after wearing a flak jacket at the front that he lost the use of both legs. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8198.02s)]
*  Too bad mine isn't more like his, Ivan thought to himself. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8206.02s)]
*  Or is it? [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8210.02s)]
*  Ivan focused on his pain. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8212.02s)]
*  He turned it over in his mind. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8214.02s)]
*  What a tantalizing daydream. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8216.02s)]
*  He heard on the radio that an evacuation vehicle was coming. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8219.02s)]
*  He limped along toward the point and saw it there. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8222.02s)]
*  Men were starting to load up. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8225.02s)]
*  He passed the soldier's slack body to a medic and stood by to give others a hand up when he saw Fiend. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8227.02s)]
*  Fiend's leg was wounded. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8233.02s)]
*  Did you know Warrior died, Fiend asked? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8236.02s)]
*  No, brother, I didn't, Ivan said. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8239.02s)]
*  Ivan knew Warrior was Fiend's closest friend. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8241.02s)]
*  Fiend was on the verge of tears. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8244.02s)]
*  Brother, I'm sorry, Ivan repeated. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8246.02s)]
*  The main thing is that you're alive, that we're standing here with you. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8249.02s)]
*  Fiend clambered up the evacuation vehicle. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8253.02s)]
*  Shepard was sitting on top of it. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8256.02s)]
*  What's the next move? [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8258.02s)]
*  Ivan looked up at them, thinking. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8260.02s)]
*  Is that it? [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8262.02s)]
*  The driver called down. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8263.02s)]
*  Shall we go? [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8264.02s)]
*  Ivan turned it over again. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8266.02s)]
*  No, he shouted. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8268.02s)]
*  He climbed up. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8270.02s)]
*  Now, let's go. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IqS2DZh2UM&t=8271.02s)]
