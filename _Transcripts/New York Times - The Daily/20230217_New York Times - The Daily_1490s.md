Video Description: Over the weekend, F.B.I. agents found classified documents at President Biden’s residence in Wilmington, Del., after conducting a 13-hour search.


The search — at the invitation of Mr. Biden’s lawyers — resulted in the latest in a series of discoveries that has already led to a special counsel investigation.


What miscalculations have Mr. Biden and his team make throughout this ordeal?


Guest: Michael D. Shear (https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-d-shear?smid=pc-thedaily) , a White House correspondent for The New York Times.


Background reading:

# What Biden Miscalculated About His Classified Documents
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=4.3s)]
*  Today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=10.84s)]
*  For the fifth time, classified documents belonging to President Biden have been found outside [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=12.46s)]
*  of a secure government location, this time by FBI agents searching his home. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=18.38s)]
*  My colleague Mike Scheer has been trying to understand how Biden chose to handle those [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=25.64s)]
*  discoveries since they began, and why for so long he left the public in the dark. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=31.4s)]
*  It's Tuesday, January 24th. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Mike, I want to start with what happened over this past weekend in Wilmington, Delaware. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=55.96s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=62.84s)]
*  Yes, it was really quite remarkable, actually. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=63.84s)]
*  The unprecedented FBI search of a sitting president's home for classified documents [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=69.2s)]
*  escalating the legal and political situation for President Biden. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=73.88s)]
*  You had the scene of the FBI and a bunch of agents at the invitation of President Biden's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=78.4s)]
*  personal lawyers. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=84.4s)]
*  We found out about this on Saturday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=85.48s)]
*  FBI agents spent nearly 13 hours scouring his Delaware home on. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=87.28s)]
*  Conducting what ended up being a 13 hour search of his personal home in Wilmington, Delaware. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=91.72s)]
*  Investigators reviewed personally handwritten notes, files, papers, binders, memorabilia, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=98.64s)]
*  to do lists, schedules and reminders going back decades. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=103.64s)]
*  Literally combing through every nook and cranny in every room and office and garage and closet [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  looking for any indication of additional classified documents that might have been there [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=115.8s)]
*  improperly. And in fact, they did find them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=121.32s)]
*  Six items, they said, that included some classification markings. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=123.88s)]
*  Some go back as far as his time in the Senate. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=128.24s)]
*  This drip, drip, drip just continues. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=131.12s)]
*  And for those keeping count, this is now the fifth time in about, let's say, three months [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=133.72s)]
*  that classified documents have been found in President Biden's possession in places [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=139.0s)]
*  where they just shouldn't be. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=144.44s)]
*  Right. Because where they should be are insecure government locations like the White [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=146.04s)]
*  House. So at this point, we've clearly reached a moment where the story of Biden and how [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=151.72s)]
*  he has handled classified documents has become something of a rolling public relations and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=158.48s)]
*  legal mess for this president. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=165.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And the amazing thing is what has ended up transpiring is exactly what they [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=168.04s)]
*  had hoped to head off when they discussed how to handle the discovery of these documents [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=174.84s)]
*  at the very beginning of this situation. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, Mike, I want you to explain that, because I know that you and a few of our colleagues [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=182.4s)]
*  have spent the past couple of days trying to both piece that together and understand [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=185.72s)]
*  the calculations made by President Biden and those around him about the best way to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=191.44s)]
*  approach a very bad situation, which is classified documents found where they shouldn't [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=197.88s)]
*  be in his orbit. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=204.0s)]
*  So tell us about that. Right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  So there's been a lot of reporting about this over the last couple of weeks. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=208.16s)]
*  What we had decided was that we would look at a very specific period of time as this [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=211.36s)]
*  has all developed. And that is what we found to be the 68 days between when the first set [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  of documents were discovered in early November of last year and when the White House finally [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=223.0s)]
*  told the public about it in early January. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=227.88s)]
*  And in essence, what we found was that the president and a very, very small circle of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=230.27999999999997s)]
*  legal and political advisors had decided that they could settle the matter quickly and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=236.0s)]
*  quietly if they were super cooperative with the Department of Justice at every turn, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=242.16s)]
*  answer every question the investigators might want, really everything they could do to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=247.36s)]
*  stand in contrast to the way former President Trump had handled a similar investigation [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=253.0s)]
*  into classified documents found at his home in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=257.92s)]
*  The former president and his lawyers initially resisted efforts by the Justice Department [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=262.4s)]
*  to look into it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=268.04s)]
*  They refused to allow searches of the House, which then led to a raid of his property [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=269.6s)]
*  and subpoenas. Right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=275.76s)]
*  And so what the Biden administration thought was if they did the opposite, they [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=276.96s)]
*  cooperate fully with the department, hopefully would avoid a big sprawling public [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=282.52s)]
*  investigation. Ultimately, they would not have to disclose anything to the public because [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=289.04s)]
*  ultimately they hoped it would just go away. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=294.84s)]
*  And of course, that's not what happened. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=297.84s)]
*  Fascinating. So the thinking here from within the Biden world is that with this Trump [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=299.92s)]
*  classified document investigation playing out in a parallel universe, they would do [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=306.56s)]
*  everything differently in a legal sense and thus not have to tell the public pretty much [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  anything. And it would all just work out. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=320.6s)]
*  Right. But it turned out that they committed a series of miscalculations. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=324.92s)]
*  They miscalculated how many documents would ultimately be found. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=331.0s)]
*  They miscalculated the way the Department of Justice would respond. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=335.48s)]
*  And ultimately, they miscalculated the way in which people would see President Biden's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=338.36s)]
*  handling of documents versus President Trump's. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=343.6s)]
*  Hmm. So, Mike, let's talk through what this strategy has looked like in practice from [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=346.44s)]
*  day one and how we arrive at those miscalculations that you just summarized. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=353.64s)]
*  Right. So it all starts on November 2nd. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  That's six days before the midterm elections. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  Very important for President Biden. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=365.56s)]
*  That's when members of the president's team are cleaning out an office in Washington at [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=367.52s)]
*  this think tank that he had worked at before becoming president and had essentially been [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=373.44s)]
*  untouched for a couple of years. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=378.4s)]
*  Now, they're cleaning that out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=380.12s)]
*  They find a handful of classified documents. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=381.68s)]
*  Right. They did immediately send the documents to the National Archives, which keeps these [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=384.76s)]
*  kinds of government papers. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=389.96s)]
*  The National Archives informed the Department of Justice. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=392.04s)]
*  But it wasn't until about November 9th or 10th that the Justice Department then gets back [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  in touch with the president's lawyers. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=401.12s)]
*  Says, hey, we are now looking into this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=403.76s)]
*  And that is when the president and this very small group of aides had to make a decision. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=407.04s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=412.2s)]
*  And the decision was we're going to completely cooperate, but we're going to be quiet. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=414.0s)]
*  We are not going to make anything about this public. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=419.0s)]
*  Right. And this is probably the biggest of these early moments, because when the Department of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=423.84s)]
*  Justice tells the president that it's looking into something, essentially that it's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=430.8s)]
*  investigating the president's conduct, that is, in theory, a very natural moment to tell [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=435.12s)]
*  the public. Yeah, a natural moment to tell the public and something pretty significant, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  especially in the light of the investigation that was going on to his predecessor. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=447.0s)]
*  Right. So it's hard to imagine that at that moment they didn't at least have a sense of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=452.0s)]
*  the importance that this could be. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=456.44s)]
*  Right. So how have you come to understand the logic of Biden and his tight circle of advisors [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  deciding not to tell the public that the Department of Justice is now investigating its [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=463.16s)]
*  handling of these classified documents? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=469.04s)]
*  So their explanation now of those early decisions was that they essentially were trying to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=472.32000000000005s)]
*  follow scrupulously all of the rules that the Justice Department usually has about ongoing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=480.24s)]
*  investigations, which is to say not to talk about them. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=487.68s)]
*  But there was also a second reason, because they thought that if they went public and tried [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=490.48s)]
*  to explain what had happened in the president's actions, folks at the Justice Department [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=495.92s)]
*  would see that as potentially being an attempt to unduly influence the course of this [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=501.2s)]
*  investigation, because, of course, the president is the attorney general's boss. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=508.64s)]
*  Right. And anything that he says publicly could be seen as an attempt to [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=513.08s)]
*  put his thumb on the scales of justice. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=517.56s)]
*  Got it. So they're saying our hands are tied. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=519.8s)]
*  And from what you're saying, that makes a certain amount of sense, at least in the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=523.4799999999999s)]
*  beginning. Right. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=529.4s)]
*  I mean, it does to a degree. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean, there is no question that Department of Justice prefers to do these kinds of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=532.64s)]
*  investigations quietly. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=536.4s)]
*  It makes it easier to find the right people to talk to. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=538.4s)]
*  They don't have to compete with the swirl of news every day. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=541.4799999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the White House had to make that decision themselves. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=545.16s)]
*  Right. Are they going to inform the public? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=548.9599999999999s)]
*  Because it's ultimately a public relations call to make. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=550.92s)]
*  And that was the one they made to stay silent. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=554.16s)]
*  Right. Because you're saying there's nothing that prevents the White House from coming [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=555.9599999999999s)]
*  out from someone standing at a podium in the White House briefing room and saying, we [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  have something to announce. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  We found documents. The Department of Justice is looking at them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=563.7199999999999s)]
*  We don't have a whole lot more to say. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=566.28s)]
*  Sorry. It might pollute investigation, but we owe you this information. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=567.8s)]
*  So you're welcome. Right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  They could have done that in November and they chose not to. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=573.88s)]
*  OK. So once they choose this strategy of cooperate, but stay silent. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=577.36s)]
*  What's the next big moment? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=582.76s)]
*  So the next moment comes just before Christmas on December 20th. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=585.4s)]
*  The president's lawyers having hoped that the Justice Department would say, hey, we [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=589.52s)]
*  finished our inquiry. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=595.52s)]
*  This is nothing. We're going to go away. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=596.84s)]
*  And that hasn't happened. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=598.4399999999999s)]
*  The Justice Department is still looking into the case. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=599.8s)]
*  And the president's lawyers decide, you know what, it's probably time to search other [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=602.96s)]
*  places that documents might be, including the president's homes, one in Wilmington, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=608.36s)]
*  Delaware and one in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=613.12s)]
*  And so the president's lawyers go ahead. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=616.2s)]
*  They searched both places and they do find some documents in Wilmington at the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=618.72s)]
*  president's home. But the president and those same aides decide we're going to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=624.1600000000001s)]
*  continue with our strategy cooperation and silence. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=629.6s)]
*  We're not going to tell the public. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  In other words, they do tell the Justice Department, hey, we found a lot more [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=635.48s)]
*  documents in this house in Wilmington, Delaware, but they do not tell us that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=639.84s)]
*  fact. Right. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=645.64s)]
*  Exactly. And you have a situation now where whether they sort of realized it in [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=646.96s)]
*  full or not, they were clearly playing with fire at this point because, you know, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=651.8000000000001s)]
*  the Justice Department clearly wasn't going away. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=656.36s)]
*  It was continuing to examine and look into this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=658.88s)]
*  Right. And so the decision that they made originally in November and now we're [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=661.3599999999999s)]
*  sticking to in December was becoming riskier and riskier. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=665.0s)]
*  Mike, at this point, because you are trying to reconstruct this period, does anyone [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=668.28s)]
*  inside the White House go to this small group of advisors and say, you know, it's [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=673.4799999999999s)]
*  probably time to tell the public what's going on. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=679.24s)]
*  Sure, there's a risk of having some influence on the DOJ, but if we craft the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=682.4s)]
*  right message and we're careful, we can do it and we will avoid the allegation [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=687.44s)]
*  that we were trying to hide this. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=692.8800000000001s)]
*  Well, so we don't have a real clear picture about who said what during that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=695.32s)]
*  period. But what we do know is that much of the White House was cut out of even [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  knowing what was going on at that point. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=703.6s)]
*  So the broader kind of White House public relations machine that we all know, the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  communications staff, the press secretary and her staff, nobody knew what was [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  going on at this point. And so there was much less opportunity for that kind of [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=716.0s)]
*  full debate about what should be done and what they should say. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=720.28s)]
*  And that ultimately comes back to be a problem for them when on January 9th, CBS [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=726.12s)]
*  News has learned that classified documents, CBS News reports were discovered at [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=731.72s)]
*  the Penn Biden Center on the initial discovery back in November, early November [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=737.04s)]
*  at the think tank of classified documents being improperly handled and in the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=743.0799999999999s)]
*  president's possession. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=747.9599999999999s)]
*  The White House at that moment does confirm that report from CBS, but the White [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=749.76s)]
*  House confirms only the narrow report from CBS about that initial discovery of [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=755.7199999999999s)]
*  documents in November. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=761.56s)]
*  Despite the fact that the White House clearly at that point knew about the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=763.12s)]
*  documents that were discovered in December, they don't tell the public about [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=767.88s)]
*  it. They continue to hold back facts and hold on to this strategy of not being [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=772.68s)]
*  fully transparent. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=777.88s)]
*  I just want to zero in on that because it feels really important. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=779.0799999999999s)]
*  The media has come to the Biden administration and said, we know about an [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=781.8s)]
*  initial batch of classified documents discovered in November. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=785.0799999999999s)]
*  And instead of coming clean with the true scale of the issue here as relates to [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=788.4799999999999s)]
*  classified documents, which is we didn't just discover one batch, we discovered [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=794.4799999999999s)]
*  two and the Department of Justice is looking into this. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=797.68s)]
*  It's gotten serious. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=800.92s)]
*  The Biden administration keeps all that secret still and just confirms the narrow [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=802.72s)]
*  reporting about November 2nd documents. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=809.96s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly right. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=814.6s)]
*  And in some ways they were still clinging to this strategy that we described earlier [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=815.88s)]
*  about not upsetting the Department of Justice, but they were also, they seemed [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=820.4s)]
*  intent on trying to keep a lid on what was clearly becoming a burgeoning scandal. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=824.96s)]
*  And which, as anyone knows, who's worked in Washington for any period of time is [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=830.12s)]
*  not likely to be the case, right? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=834.72s)]
*  These things come out. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=836.72s)]
*  You can't stop these things from becoming a big media story. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=838.52s)]
*  And yet they tried. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=841.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=843.84s)]
*  And here again, we're looking at what seems like a miscalculation because it's not [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=844.52s)]
*  just that these stories always come out. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=848.64s)]
*  Like you said, Mike, it's that when they come out and people learn that you [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=850.36s)]
*  withheld them, the judgments become even harsher. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=855.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=860.12s)]
*  And in this case, the 68 days of silence has not worked out the way they'd hoped. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=860.6s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=879.44s)]
*  So Mike, once this 68 day approach of trying to keep the public in the dark comes to an end [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=880.2s)]
*  with this CBS report, what happens next? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=894.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, so everything that the president and the top aides around him had hoped wouldn't [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=898.24s)]
*  happen, well, that happens pretty quickly. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=902.2s)]
*  So a few days later on January 11th, there are more news reports that leak out this time [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=904.76s)]
*  about the discovery of that second trove of documents back in December. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=911.4799999999999s)]
*  Huge embarrassment for the Biden administration makes them look like what they had done, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=915.4799999999999s)]
*  which was hold back information. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=920.16s)]
*  Then the following day, January 12th, the Department of Justice comes out. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=922.16s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland says, look, we've been investigating President [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  Biden and these documents, but now we're going to be appointing a special counsel to look [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=933.6s)]
*  into this. It's a much more formal investigation to what happened. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=938.6s)]
*  It's a move that is often done when the attorney general feels like there's so much [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=941.92s)]
*  politics swirling around a case like this that you need somebody much more independent [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=945.96s)]
*  to conduct the investigation. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=951.68s)]
*  Right. And this is clearly the moment where all the calculations, Mike, that you have [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=956.48s)]
*  been describing that Biden and those around him made really seem to kind of fall apart [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=959.76s)]
*  because the logic of it always was if we handle this differently than Trump, then it [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=966.84s)]
*  will create a very different outcome than in the Trump investigation. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=973.4s)]
*  But of course, when the Department of Justice appoints a special counsel, in many ways, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=976.84s)]
*  it's starting to feel like the exact same level of seriousness that it's been bringing to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=980.64s)]
*  the Trump investigation because there is a special counsel for that one as well. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=984.68s)]
*  That's exactly right. The president and his team misunderstood how seriously the Department [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=990.16s)]
*  of Justice would take a case like this. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=996.24s)]
*  And they miscalculated that there would ever be a world in which the Department of Justice [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=999.52s)]
*  could just look the other way in Biden's case while simultaneously investigating [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1003.88s)]
*  President Trump. Right. In some ways, the Trump investigation actually necessitates [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1009.88s)]
*  that the Department of Justice take the Biden investigation as seriously and with as much [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1015.16s)]
*  force. Yes. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1020.8s)]
*  And from there, things got even worse for President Biden. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1022.8399999999999s)]
*  A couple of days later, on January 14th, the lawyers for the president found even more [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1025.8s)]
*  documents during a search of the president's library, just adding to both the substantive [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  total number of documents that had been found and to the sense of a kind of drip, drip, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  in which the president and his team don't look like they're being forthcoming. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1042.32s)]
*  And shortly after that, we have the FBI search of Biden's house in Wilmington that you [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1045.8799999999999s)]
*  described at the start of our conversation, like which turns up even more classified [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1050.6799999999998s)]
*  documents. So at this point, how many documents are we talking about? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1054.8s)]
*  And can we say much about the nature of them and the classifications they involve? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1059.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, much of that remains opaque at this point. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1065.3999999999999s)]
*  We don't know details about what the documents actually are, why they are classified, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  what level of classification that have been stamped on them. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1072.76s)]
*  The president's personal lawyer said over the weekend that investigators had seized six [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1075.52s)]
*  more items on Friday in that 13 hour search. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1079.36s)]
*  But how many pages is an item, whether that could be a box of documents or a single [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1083.84s)]
*  document, that still is unclear to us. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1089.12s)]
*  And I think we're still working to better understand the number of documents and what's [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1091.7199999999998s)]
*  in there. Right. And I'm guessing the answer may be we don't know yet. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1096.64s)]
*  But do we have any sense of how what Biden was found to have kept in his homes and [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1098.96s)]
*  offices compares with what the FBI found at Mar-a-Lago? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1103.76s)]
*  So we know that there were many fewer documents found in President Biden's possession [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1109.32s)]
*  than there were down at Mar-a-Lago and President Trump's possession. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1114.0s)]
*  We don't have a lot of information about the difference in terms of classification [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1118.08s)]
*  level. We do know that in the case of President Biden, many of the documents date [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1122.68s)]
*  back many years. They were from his time as vice president and in some cases, even [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1127.72s)]
*  his time as a senator before that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1133.0800000000002s)]
*  Whereas in the case of President Trump, documents were obviously from his presidency, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1135.16s)]
*  which were much more recent. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1139.92s)]
*  So what we can say with confidence is that the Biden classified documents are fewer [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1141.52s)]
*  and they are older. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1146.68s)]
*  Right. You know, but in the end, no matter what level of classification and no matter [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1148.04s)]
*  how old they are, there are documents that should be handled properly and are going to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1151.88s)]
*  be important to the Justice Department no matter what. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1156.92s)]
*  Right. You know, it strikes me that in the end, the Biden White House did execute on [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1159.5600000000002s)]
*  this strategy very faithfully. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1166.24s)]
*  I mean, they did cooperate seemingly at every turn with the Department of Justice and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1168.5600000000002s)]
*  they did for those 68 days keep all this information from the public. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1173.44s)]
*  And so I wonder how the people in Biden's inner circle now think about that strategy, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1180.84s)]
*  given where we are and how it all looks today. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1187.92s)]
*  I mean, look, the folks that we've talked to inside the White House discuss this as a [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1193.48s)]
*  sort of long term versus short term strategy. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1198.08s)]
*  Yes, in the immediate days and weeks, fingers are being pointed. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1201.32s)]
*  A lot of media attention being paid to this in a way they would obviously have preferred [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1206.04s)]
*  to avoid. But they argue that in the long run, it will be proven out to have been the [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1210.4s)]
*  right move, both in terms of preventing the president from getting into any serious legal [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1215.84s)]
*  jeopardy, which they insist that he won't be because of how cooperative he's been. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1222.44s)]
*  And they think that drawing the sharpest distinction they could with how former [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1226.24s)]
*  President Donald Trump handled it will ultimately end up to be a really good PR move [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1232.56s)]
*  as well. In the long run, again, you know, at the end of this saga of both presidents [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1238.04s)]
*  and their handling of documents, they, I think, fully believe that they will be seen as [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1243.68s)]
*  having made the proper choices to cooperate, even if that meant that they took a PR hit. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1248.92s)]
*  Whereas the former president, Mr. Trump, will have been seen to be taking a different [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1254.76s)]
*  path and potentially taking a very different kind of hit at the end of this DOJ investigation. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1259.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. Exactly. I'm curious, is this how you see it as a longtime White House reporter [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1264.9199999999998s)]
*  as a strategy with a short term pain, long term gain kind of ratio? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think that we'll have to see where this all ends up. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1278.28s)]
*  I think that what it does reveal about this White House is how they see themselves. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1285.56s)]
*  The president sees himself as one of the good guys coming into office after President [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1294.12s)]
*  Trump. And I think ultimately that sense of self governs how President Biden and his top [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1299.0s)]
*  aides, how they behave and how they behaved in this case. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1307.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, I think they really thought that given that view of themselves, that the Justice [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1310.4s)]
*  Department, the investigators, ultimately the public, when they found out, we're going [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1316.2800000000002s)]
*  to essentially shrug and say, you know, this is a kind of minor infraction, a minor incident, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1320.44s)]
*  and let's move on. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1326.8000000000002s)]
*  And ultimately, that was not what happened. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1330.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, Mike, thank you very much. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1341.4s)]
*  Happy to do it. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1345.0400000000002s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1352.64s)]
*  Here's what else you need to nerdy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1353.44s)]
*  The death toll from the mass shooting in Monterey Park, California, rose to 11 on Monday as [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1368.72s)]
*  police began releasing the identities of those who were killed. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1375.44s)]
*  Many of the victims were in their 60s and 70s and were shot as they participated in [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1380.08s)]
*  an event at a popular ballroom dance hall, the first of two venues that the gunman tried [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1385.6399999999999s)]
*  to attack. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1392.3999999999999s)]
*  I needed to get the weapon away from him. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1393.3999999999999s)]
*  I needed to take this weapon, disarm him or else everybody would have died. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1394.8799999999999s)]
*  On Monday, a 26 year old employee at the second dance hall described how he confronted the [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1400.12s)]
*  suspected shooter moments after he entered the building and prevented further bloodshed. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1406.4s)]
*  When I got the courage, I lunged at him with both my hands, grabbed the weapon and we had [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1413.16s)]
*  a struggle. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1419.96s)]
*  We struggled into the lobby trying to get this gun away from each other. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1421.1200000000001s)]
*  Finally, at one point, I was able to pull the gun away from him. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1426.5600000000002s)]
*  Police say that the shooter's motive remains unclear. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1431.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, seven people were killed in San Mateo County on Monday in yet another mass [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1437.0400000000002s)]
*  shooting in California. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1443.96s)]
*  Police said the suspect in that shooting is now in custody. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXk0Rdj7d7g&t=1446.3600000000001s)]
