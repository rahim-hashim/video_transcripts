# The End of Justin Trudeau’s Canada
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=0.0s)]
*  This week, Justin Trudeau said he'd step down as Prime Minister of Canada. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=10.64s)]
*  That marked the stunning downfall of a man who was once seen as a global icon of progressive [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=15.34s)]
*  politics. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=20.48s)]
*  Today, my colleague, Matina Steves-Gridnev, explains the forces that led to Trudeau's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=21.48s)]
*  collapse. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=27.0s)]
*  And she talks about the populist leader who could replace him, just as Donald Trump returns [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=28.0s)]
*  to power. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=32.72s)]
*  It's Wednesday, January 8th. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Matina, for me and I think for a lot of people, when we heard Justin Trudeau was stepping [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=43.0s)]
*  down, it felt like a pretty remarkable moment. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=50.2s)]
*  Especially because he's been in power for so many years, almost a decade, and he'd really [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=53.76s)]
*  become something of a fixture in global politics, but also because of the way that he was doing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=57.92s)]
*  it, the way he was residing, not finishing out his term, choosing to just kind of exit [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=64.2s)]
*  the political stage. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=70.32s)]
*  You cover Canada. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=72.32s)]
*  What did you make of that moment? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=73.84s)]
*  I mean, I know what you mean, Natalie, but honestly, he resigned, but I really don't think [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=76.08s)]
*  it was much of a choice. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=82.64s)]
*  Yes, he had been around for a really long time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=84.72s)]
*  It's almost kind of hard to remember a time when he wasn't Canadian Prime Minister. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=88.36s)]
*  But if you've been following Canadian politics, you would know this was a really long time [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=93.0s)]
*  coming and for many Canadians, well overdue. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=98.12s)]
*  He had been under tremendous pressure from within his party to step down, and the public [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=101.56s)]
*  had made it abundantly clear that they were no longer supporting him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=106.76s)]
*  His popularity was at historic lows, and eventually the growing calls from within his [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=110.96s)]
*  party for him to step down showed him the exit. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=116.08s)]
*  Well, okay, so tell me, how did he get to that point where he really didn't have a choice [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=119.72s)]
*  but to do what he did? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=125.58s)]
*  I mean, broadly speaking, the arc of Justin Trudeau's narrative is one of rapid and spectacular [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=127.16s)]
*  rise and slow and steady decline. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=136.04s)]
*  And really, that rise kind of almost started from his birth. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=141.16s)]
*  He was born, well, his father was in his first term of being Prime Minister of Canada. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  He's late father, Pierre Trudeau. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=150.98s)]
*  And Justin Trudeau is born in the spotlight and raised in the trappings of Canadian political [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  power. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=160.84s)]
*  But when he decides himself as a young man to enter politics, running for member of parliament [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  in the late 2000s with the Liberal Party, his father's party, he's sort of seen as this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=168.14s)]
*  wimp or kind of weak from a character perspective. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=174.76s)]
*  So despite his background, he's definitely not automatically commanding the respect of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=178.64s)]
*  the political establishment in Canada. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=184.0s)]
*  It is now time for your main event. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=186.48s)]
*  Please welcome Justin Trudeau. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=192.16s)]
*  And one of the first things I think he did to dispel that notion was that he literally [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=200.56s)]
*  participated in a charity boxing match against a very serious conservative politician who [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=207.92s)]
*  had a black belt in karate. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=216.04s)]
*  And of course, people anticipated Trudeau to get destroyed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=222.12s)]
*  But he wasn't. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=227.12s)]
*  He actually hung in there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=228.76s)]
*  And he won the match. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=236.28s)]
*  I proved that a liberal can take a punch. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=237.76s)]
*  I proved that we're not people who can be counted out, even though we seem nicer and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=241.16s)]
*  a little more touchy feely. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=247.76s)]
*  And I know it sounds really basic, but people started calling him a fighter after that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=250.28s)]
*  So it's fair to say this is actually good for his image. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=257.52s)]
*  While it may seem kind of gimmicky, it worked. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=260.6s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=264.4s)]
*  And within a year, Trudeau becomes the leader of the Liberal Party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=266.88s)]
*  Now, to be clear, the Liberal Party was a disaster when Trudeau became its leader in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=272.88s)]
*  2013. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=280.64s)]
*  And Justin Trudeau quickly resuscitated it, brought it back from the dead, and by 2015 [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=282.72s)]
*  had done such a good job putting the party back together and bringing it back to strength [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=292.24s)]
*  that he sweeps into government and becomes Prime Minister. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=297.4s)]
*  I got elected on a platform of openness, of transparency, of engagement, of listening [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  to Canadians, of trusting people with real answers to tough questions, a level of respect [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=314.08s)]
*  for citizens that, for me, is at the heart of what a 21st century democracy looks like. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  And he's obviously popular in Canada. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  He's just won this very important election. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=330.0s)]
*  But boy is he popular globally. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  He just explodes on the global political scene like a rock star. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=335.56s)]
*  It's no secret that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is hot and smoldering. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  But would you be surprised to learn that when Justin was younger, he was even hotter and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=346.96s)]
*  smoldier? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=352.8s)]
*  Ow, Canada! [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=354.4s)]
*  The global press is phoning over him from the broadsheet Sirius Papers to the glossy [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=358.12s)]
*  women's magazines. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=364.76s)]
*  Vogue declares him one of the unconventional hotties of the year. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=366.68s)]
*  It's really a phenomenon. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think he was seen by a lot of people as a sort of successor to the Obama progressive [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=376.88s)]
*  dream. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=389.36s)]
*  Remember, this is the tail end of the second Obama presidency. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=390.36s)]
*  And here's this younger guy in Canada who seems to stand for sort of the same principles, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=394.08s)]
*  the same values and have that same sort of sunny, hopeful outlook. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=400.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=404.76s)]
*  It really does take you back to this era where that brand of progressive politics was just [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=405.92s)]
*  in. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  And Justin Trudeau is a global poster boy for those ideals. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=413.15999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  He declares himself a feminist. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  He also pursues policies that we identify with progressive politics, such as climate [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=420.28s)]
*  change-related policies, reconciliation with Indigenous communities in Canada, and a very [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=425.32s)]
*  pro-refugee stance in the middle of the Syrian civil war. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=432.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=437.0s)]
*  And then I remember Trump gets elected the next year, and Trudeau really kind of takes [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=438.0s)]
*  on this role as a counterweight to him and his approach to immigration writ large. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  The world projects on him expectations of being the antithesis of Trump. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=453.64000000000004s)]
*  And Trudeau really leans into the idea that he's the opposite of Trump. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=459.88s)]
*  In fact, he takes the opportunity to showcase that straight off the bat. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=465.32s)]
*  Soon after Donald Trump is inaugurated, he announces a major policy known as the Muslim [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=470.88s)]
*  ban. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  And in response to that, Trudeau goes to what was then still known as Twitter and says, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  To those fleeing persecution, terror, and war, Canadians will welcome you regardless [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=484.08s)]
*  of your faith. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  Diversity is our strength. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=491.4s)]
*  Hashtag welcome to Canada. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=493.08s)]
*  Is there a more anti-Trump message than that in that moment? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=496.44s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=500.52s)]
*  I remember at the time for liberals in the United States, he was this ideal leader. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=501.56s)]
*  I remember there was talk of how they were all going to move to Canada. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=509.08s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  It was it was a whole thing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=514.16s)]
*  And, you know, he really relished that reputation and it had staying power on the global stage. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=515.4s)]
*  But at home, his star started to dim around that time. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=523.52s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=529.48s)]
*  What happened? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=530.48s)]
*  Well, there were a series of what we would call scandals. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=531.48s)]
*  As I said, this was a personal family vacation where we visited someone who I have known [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=538.36s)]
*  pretty much all my life. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=546.48s)]
*  He accepted this luxurious holiday on a private island as a gift. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=548.0s)]
*  And many people saw it as deeply inappropriate and a conflict of interest. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he deeply regrets wearing blackface in a resurfaced [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=559.32s)]
*  photo. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=564.08s)]
*  Photos of him from his student days wearing blackface emerged. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=565.08s)]
*  This is something that I deeply, deeply regret. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=570.44s)]
*  And this really shocked people because remember Trudeau's whole thing was that he was a very [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  progressive politician. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=581.2s)]
*  So you start to see the shine come off of the image, at least, of this golden boy of [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=586.44s)]
*  at one point really seems to have it all. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=591.84s)]
*  I'm now wondering about his track record of actually governing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  How are his policies going over with voters? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=598.72s)]
*  Look, he definitely scores a few wins, but he very quickly gets into trouble and starts [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  struggling in that department as well. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=608.6s)]
*  I think a good example of that is this policy known as the carbon tax that he launches and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  it just becomes deeply unpopular. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  It's convoluted, it's complicated. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=620.18s)]
*  The opposition paints it as this huge burden on Canadians and he continues to struggle [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=622.18s)]
*  to sell it as a success. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=629.18s)]
*  But where his problems and his troubles with the Canadian public really start to compound [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=632.42s)]
*  is when the pandemic hits. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=638.78s)]
*  And as vaccine mandates and protracted restrictions on movement and social interactions and the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=640.9s)]
*  economy really take their toll on Canadian society, a lot of people start more directly [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=647.22s)]
*  turning against him. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=655.58s)]
*  I have actually been out here since last Saturday. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=657.66s)]
*  Monte, who do not want to share his last name, is one of hundreds of truckers blocking the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=660.34s)]
*  roads around Parliament in Canada's capital city, demanding an end to vaccine mandates. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=664.98s)]
*  And there is a small but very vocal minority in Canada that really erupts in protest against [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=671.16s)]
*  these restrictions, also known as the freedom convoy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=680.28s)]
*  The freedom convoy, that's what they call themselves. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=684.52s)]
*  It's snowballed now to sort of blockade in Canada for days. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=687.0s)]
*  We've seen chaos in Ottawa. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=690.04s)]
*  We started as a protest against vaccine requirements for lorry drivers, but it's mushroomed to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=691.76s)]
*  an anti-government movement which has paralyzed not only this capital city, but vital trade [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  routes between Canada and the US. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=703.76s)]
*  And it sort of grew into a broader protest movement against Justin Trudeau and the things [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=706.48s)]
*  he stood for. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=713.4s)]
*  And of course, coming out of the pandemic, Canada's economy, like so many other economies [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  around the world, is really crippled. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=719.2s)]
*  It's facing rapid inflation and labor shortages. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=721.48s)]
*  So you have all these economic problems starting to stack up. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=725.66s)]
*  And I think this brings us to one of the biggest policy failures for Trudeau, which has been [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=729.74s)]
*  his immigration policy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=736.74s)]
*  In response to those post-pandemic labor shortages, and in order to get Canada's economy going [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=738.9s)]
*  again, the Trudeau government decides to bring in millions of temporary foreign workers to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=744.38s)]
*  fill in jobs that they're saying Canadians won't do. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=753.06s)]
*  And the result for that is that within two and a half, three years, the country adds [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=758.3s)]
*  more than 3 million people in its population. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=765.8199999999999s)]
*  It goes from 38 million total population to more than 41 million. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=769.6999999999999s)]
*  And while that actually does do some good things for the economy, the addition of millions [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=776.9000000000001s)]
*  of new people in Canada stretches resources that were already quite thin. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=783.98s)]
*  And it compounds the housing crisis and an access to health care crisis that were already [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=791.08s)]
*  brewing since before the pandemic. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=797.5600000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, Mr. Trudeau acknowledged that this policy had created serious problems and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=801.38s)]
*  announced that it needed to be rapidly curtailed. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=806.34s)]
*  But the damage had been done to his reputation and to the trust that the electorate showed [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=809.72s)]
*  him. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=815.74s)]
*  And Trudeau sees his popularity plummet to historic lows. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=817.34s)]
*  He becomes frankly loathed among Canadians who poll after poll for several months say [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=824.7s)]
*  they want him out, giving his opponents, the Conservative Party, a double digit lead, coming [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=833.22s)]
*  to the end of 2024, a 25 point lead over the Liberals. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=841.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=848.3800000000001s)]
*  So what's the response from the party? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=849.72s)]
*  The Liberal Party doesn't have a formal mechanism to get rid of Trudeau. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=852.34s)]
*  And it's also Trudeau's party. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=858.5s)]
*  Remember, the party was crushed and he brought it back from the dead. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=861.38s)]
*  So it becomes really hard to separate the party and the man. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=865.5s)]
*  And yet... [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=869.8000000000001s)]
*  Calls are growing ever louder for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to quit. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=870.9s)]
*  On a recent call involving a third of its Liberal Party's members of parliament, they [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=875.4200000000001s)]
*  all agreed that it was time for the PM to go. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=880.62s)]
*  Starting from members of parliament and growing voices within the party start to ask him to [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=883.5s)]
*  leave and let someone else lead the party and the country. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=889.5s)]
*  The prime minister needs to step down. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=893.4s)]
*  He needs to step down immediately for us to have any chance in the next election. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=894.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm here to repeat the message that I delivered to the prime minister that I believe he needs [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=899.5s)]
*  to step down and call leadership race. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=903.3s)]
*  The message that I've been getting loud and clear and more and more strongly as time goes [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=905.3199999999999s)]
*  by is that it's time for him to go. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=909.78s)]
*  And I agree. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=912.5s)]
*  But Mr. Trudeau appears completely attached to his position. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=913.78s)]
*  He says, I am not going anywhere until in December, one of his most important allies, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=918.3s)]
*  the country's deputy prime minister, a woman named Christiana Freeland, resigns in acrimony [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=924.6999999999999s)]
*  and indicates that she can no longer support him. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  She says Trudeau has been governing the country with a narrow political gain in mind rather [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=933.3s)]
*  than having the best interest of Canadians at heart. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=938.64s)]
*  And this is the straw that breaks the camel's back. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=943.0s)]
*  So I thought it might be fun for us to do this again. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=946.52s)]
*  Justin Trudeau takes the holiday season to reflect on his future. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=956.52s)]
*  And then on Monday, he finally addresses the nation. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=965.28s)]
*  And announces that he intends to step down as prime minister and as Liberal Party leader. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=969.88s)]
*  We were elected to strengthen the economy post pandemic and advanced Canada's interests [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=977.14s)]
*  in a complicated world. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=982.92s)]
*  And that is exactly the job that I and we will continue to do for Canadians. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=985.28s)]
*  Merci beaucoup, mes amis. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=992.44s)]
*  And in doing so, he puts the country on course for a lengthy, messy, chaotic transition, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=995.04s)]
*  at the end of which a new leadership could put Canada on a completely different course [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1003.56s)]
*  to the one it's been on for the last 10 years. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1009.5s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1018.0s)]
*  So, Matina, now that Trudeau has announced that he's stepping down, what happens next? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1025.04s)]
*  Where does this messy, chaotic transition that you mentioned, where does it go from [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1037.48s)]
*  here? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1042.52s)]
*  Well, practically speaking, the Liberal Party will take the next few weeks to elect a new [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1043.52s)]
*  leader and that person will automatically become the prime minister. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1049.52s)]
*  I think that will be very short lived. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1054.98s)]
*  I think as we go into the spring, the country will hold general elections. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1056.98s)]
*  And even though a new Liberal leader could rapidly transform the fortunes of the party, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1062.7s)]
*  polling does suggest that the Conservative Party of Canada and its leader, Pierre Poliev, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1067.5400000000002s)]
*  a 45-year-old career politician, are going to be winning or likely winning the next federal [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1073.7s)]
*  election. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1081.74s)]
*  So tell me about him, this potential new leader. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1082.74s)]
*  After nine years of this prime minister, everything is broken. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1087.3s)]
*  25% of Canadians are now living in poverty, 2 million lined up at food banks, 38% more [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1091.38s)]
*  people are homeless. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1099.54s)]
*  Housing costs have doubled. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1101.22s)]
*  It wasn't like this before this prime minister and it won't be like this after he's gone. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1103.14s)]
*  So Pierre Poliev presents as a pretty mainstream populist 21st century right-wing leader. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1107.94s)]
*  Capping spending, cutting waste to bring down inflation and interest rates by removing bureaucracy [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1115.94s)]
*  to build more affordable homes. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1122.18s)]
*  And his message tends to be short, pithy. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1125.02s)]
*  He loves slogans like, ask the tax, stop the crime. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1130.8400000000001s)]
*  He endorses traditional family values. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1136.2s)]
*  He believes in the nuclear family and so on. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1139.74s)]
*  And I think a lot of his messaging is fairly textbook conservative. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1143.76s)]
*  He believes, for example, in the deregulation of the economy, getting the government out [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1149.6000000000001s)]
*  of the way of people's lives, of businesses cutting red tape. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1154.44s)]
*  Same things that we're hearing from conservatives in other parts of the world. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1160.16s)]
*  Mr. Poliev is also someone who has been very smart about harvesting this moment of anti-progressive [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1165.1s)]
*  politics that are really rising right now. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1174.2s)]
*  Some people might call it anti-woke. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1178.42s)]
*  And he has been able to make that part of his brand. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1182.02s)]
*  The prime minister has no business in decisions that should rest with provinces and parents. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1186.24s)]
*  So my message to Justin Trudeau is butt out and let provinces run schools and let parents [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1194.22s)]
*  raise kids. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1200.4s)]
*  And his promise to Canadians is to frankly be the opposite of Justin Trudeau. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1202.3600000000001s)]
*  This is the consequence of Trudeau NDP policies and Canadians across the country. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1208.8600000000001s)]
*  But especially right here in the South Okanagan are demanding common sense, which is what I represent. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1215.08s)]
*  It sounds like he's someone who may be more potentially aligned with Trump than Trudeau, right? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1220.72s)]
*  I sort of think of Poliev and Trump as ideological cousins. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1230.8600000000001s)]
*  I think there's a lot of overlap in some of the core traditional conservative ideas that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1235.54s)]
*  both leaders espouse. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1240.98s)]
*  And those are, again, quite textbook. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1243.82s)]
*  They're not particularly fresh or new. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1246.04s)]
*  I think too that Mr. Poliev is very smart about using social media in his favor. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1249.56s)]
*  Of course, this is a moment with Elon Musk and X that is playing in Mr. Poliev's favor. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1256.92s)]
*  And he really knows how to use that. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1263.44s)]
*  He has been a strong communicator. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1265.8799999999999s)]
*  Experts say the strongest communicator Justin Trudeau had ever had to face, and Justin Trudeau [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1269.1399999999999s)]
*  was considered a very strong communicator. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1273.6399999999999s)]
*  And so, yes, there are several similarities with Trump. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1276.94s)]
*  Nonetheless, Mr. Poliev is also very Canadian. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1280.76s)]
*  You will hear him talk about really curbing the immigration program that Mr. Trudeau ushered [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1284.8600000000001s)]
*  in, which backfired. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1292.6000000000001s)]
*  But you will never really hear him say things that are profoundly anti-immigrant. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1294.9s)]
*  And so there are still many elements of Mr. Poliev that are unique to this country and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1300.04s)]
*  unique to Canadian conservatism, I think. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1305.64s)]
*  So I mean, the results of these elections are not a foregone conclusion by any stretch. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1308.9s)]
*  But it sounds like if Poliev takes the reins of government in Canada, Trump would be facing [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1313.38s)]
*  a very different situation in Canada than the one that he had when he first came to [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1318.66s)]
*  office. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1323.7s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about a potential, as you said, ideological cousin versus what he [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1324.7s)]
*  had in Trudeau, which was someone who was opposed to him ideologically. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1329.14s)]
*  I agree. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1335.5s)]
*  I mean, it will definitely be different. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1336.5s)]
*  We don't have enough information right now to know what Poliev plans to do when it comes [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1338.38s)]
*  to actually sitting down with Donald Trump. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1345.98s)]
*  And I would add here that just from observation, political affiliation does not necessarily [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1349.58s)]
*  mean that you get a good deal from Donald Trump. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1355.18s)]
*  So much of what transpires when leaders meet with Donald Trump trying to advance their [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1359.14s)]
*  country's agenda comes down to tactics and personal chemistry. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1365.8000000000002s)]
*  And this is a personal chemistry that's completely untested, as opposed, for example, to the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1370.8000000000002s)]
*  Trudeau-Trump chemistry, which we watched play out for several years. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1376.0400000000002s)]
*  And it's not just about getting along, right? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1381.24s)]
*  Canada and the United States are each other's closest allies and biggest trading partners. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1384.72s)]
*  And Mr. Trump has beef with Canada. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1390.5s)]
*  He has Canada in his crosshairs. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1393.2s)]
*  He has talked about wanting to close the trade surplus that Canada has over the United States. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1395.72s)]
*  He wants Canada to do a better job protecting the joint border between the two countries. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1402.76s)]
*  And he has very importantly threatened to slap a 25% tariff on Canadian goods imported [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1408.58s)]
*  into the United States, a tariff that would crush the Canadian economy and send it into [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1415.1799999999998s)]
*  a recession. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1420.82s)]
*  So these are very serious issues that the new leader of Canada will need to negotiate [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1422.1s)]
*  over with Mr. Trump. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1428.26s)]
*  And yes, potentially being ideological cousins could be an advantage for Mr. Poliev if he [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1430.98s)]
*  is that leader. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1436.26s)]
*  It's not a foregone conclusion that the two men would see eye to eye. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1438.18s)]
*  It would be in your relationship that would have to be built up and tested. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1442.18s)]
*  Matina, just reflecting on the larger story you've been telling us, and you alluded to [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1446.5s)]
*  this earlier, the fact that there has been this larger anti-incumbency movement across [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1451.62s)]
*  the globe, specifically against liberal incumbents. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1457.98s)]
*  In many countries, you have this mix of anti-immigrant sentiment and economic frustrations that have [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1461.98s)]
*  really spelled trouble for progressive political parties. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1467.82s)]
*  And I'm wondering what you think the fall of Trudeau signifies for the world. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1471.86s)]
*  I mean, Natalie, I think first of all, the end of the Trudeau era here in Canada certainly [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1478.78s)]
*  fits that trend that you've described. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1486.22s)]
*  The rise of voters against incumbents, particularly liberal governments that were in power during [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1489.32s)]
*  the pandemic. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1496.6599999999999s)]
*  People around the world, we've seen it in the United States and in Europe, have become [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1498.02s)]
*  deeply disenchanted with the way progressive politicians manage the economic fallout, as [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1501.82s)]
*  well as other elements and facets of their lives in the course of the last few years [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1508.1399999999999s)]
*  and are just voting them out one by one. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1514.22s)]
*  And Justin Trudeau certainly fits that pattern. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1517.4199999999998s)]
*  And I think there is a sort of poetry to it, not to be all romantic in a tragic way, but [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1521.62s)]
*  this is an era of the growing popularity of progressive politics, the vision and the hope [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1530.54s)]
*  and the dream around it that Trudeau was an icon for. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1538.78s)]
*  And that era is very clearly coming to an end, a crushing end. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1544.94s)]
*  And it almost feels inevitable that with it, Trudeau's career would also end and mark a [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1551.26s)]
*  sort of bookend to that period of progressive politics. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1559.94s)]
*  And what will come next for centrist or center-left political parties in the developed world is [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1563.8999999999999s)]
*  up for debate. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1570.22s)]
*  Whatever Justin Trudeau stood for as a symbol in the past, I think we can safely say that [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1572.1s)]
*  that's over. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1579.5s)]
*  Matina, thank you so much. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1584.74s)]
*  Thank you, Natalie. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1587.3799999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1599.54s)]
*  Here's what else you should know today. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1601.78s)]
*  Canada and the United States, that would really be something. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1610.06s)]
*  You get rid of that artificially drawn line and you take a look at what that looks like, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1614.34s)]
*  and it would also be much better for national security. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1619.7s)]
*  Don't forget, we basically protect Canada. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1621.78s)]
*  In an hour-long news conference from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump repeated [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1624.26s)]
*  his threats to take control of Canada and said he told hockey legend Wayne Gretzky to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1629.58s)]
*  vie for the prime ministership. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1634.62s)]
*  Canada is subsidized to the tune of about $200 billion a year plus other things. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1637.1s)]
*  Trump criticized Canada, saying it should become a U.S. state because of the financial [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1644.3s)]
*  support the United States provides the country. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1648.6599999999999s)]
*  Can you assure the world that as you try to get control of these areas, you are not going [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1651.82s)]
*  to use this military or economic coercion? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1659.3s)]
*  No. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1661.98s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about that? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1662.98s)]
*  Trump also refused to rule out using military force to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1663.98s)]
*  of Denmark, and to retake the Panama Canal, which the U.S. ceded to Panama by treaty in [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1668.8999999999999s)]
*  the late 1990s. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1674.1399999999999s)]
*  The president-elect threatened to quote, tariff Denmark at a very high level if it doesn't [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1676.7s)]
*  give Greenland to the U.S. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1681.22s)]
*  Firing back, Justin Trudeau said there quote, isn't a snowball's chance in hell of joining [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1683.98s)]
*  Canada and the U.S. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1688.9s)]
*  Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that Greenland's prime minister was very [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1690.5400000000002s)]
*  clear that quote, Greenland is not for sale and will not be in the future. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1694.74s)]
*  And the Panamanian foreign minister said quote, the canal belongs to the Panamanians and it [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1700.5s)]
*  will continue to be that way. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1705.6200000000001s)]
*  And a wildfire broke out in Southern California on Tuesday morning and rapidly grew in intensity. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1708.18s)]
*  The blaze destroyed homes and forced tens of thousands of residents to flee. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1715.2s)]
*  By Tuesday evening, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KXRP_HidgU&t=1720.24s)]
