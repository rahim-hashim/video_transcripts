# Canada Confronts India Over Alleged Assassination
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRdAad_Zc3Q)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  The relationship between two democratic allies fell to its lowest point in history this week,
*  after Canada accused India of being involved in the assassination of a Canadian citizen
*  on Canadian soil.
*  Today, my colleague South Asia Bureau Chief Mujeeb Mashal on this stunning allegation,
*  and on what India's reaction tells us about the era of its leader, Narendra Modi.
*  It's Thursday, September 21st.
*  So Mujeeb, tell me about the accusations that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made on
*  Monday.
*  Prime Minister Trudeau got on the floor of the Parliament Monday afternoon.
*  Mr. Speaker, today I'm rising to inform the House of an extremely serious matter.
*  And he said he had something very serious to share.
*  Over the past number of weeks, Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible
*  allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing of
*  a Canadian citizen.
*  That his government had information linking agents of the Indian government with a killing
*  of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.
*  And he named the individual.
*  Hardeep Singh Najjar.
*  It is contrary to the fundamental rules by which free, open and democratic societies
*  conduct themselves.
*  And Trudeau was very visibly incensed.
*  And he made clear that this was an issue the Canadian government was taking very, very
*  seriously, that it was a matter of a breach of Canada's sovereignty.
*  In the strongest possible terms, I continue to urge the government of India to cooperate
*  with Canada to get to the bottom of this matter.
*  And this was a hugely explosive moment because here was the Prime Minister of Canada leveling
*  a huge accusation against one of its allies.
*  Right.
*  The leader of one democracy accusing another democracy of a killing like this, it just
*  doesn't happen.
*  Usually if a state wants to get someone in another democracy, they go through legal channels.
*  They ask that state to extradite the person.
*  They don't just go into another democracy's territory and kill someone because that would
*  just be incredibly destabilizing for the world.
*  It's rare.
*  It's very rare and it's associated with governments that are not seen as democratic.
*  And it has definitely not been associated with India and with India's security agencies.
*  So the fact that the accusation came from the highest level of the Canadian government,
*  that this was the Prime Minister of Canada putting his own face on this accusation and
*  making the accusation from the floor of the parliament made clear how big of a deal this
*  is and how much is at stake in the relationship between these two countries.
*  So what do we know about what Trudeau is alleging here?
*  I mean, what details do we have about this killing?
*  So the details are very, very limited.
*  What we know is that in June, Mr. Najjar was in the parking lot of this temple he was associated
*  with and two masked gunmen came up to him and shot him and that the masked gunmen then got away
*  in a vehicle and Mr. Najjar was dead.
*  Obviously, it caused a shock in his community and there were reactions to his murder.
*  But whether it was a political killing or anything else remained a mystery at the time.
*  So Trudeau's speech this week was the first time we heard a formal allegation.
*  And what do we know about this man that Trudeau says the Indian government helped kill?
*  We know that he was 45 years old, that he had moved from the Indian state of Punjab
*  to Canada in 1990s and that at some point during his time in Canada after he settled there,
*  he worked as a plumber, that he was very heavily involved in his local Sikh community
*  and that in 2020 he actually became the head of a local Sikh temple in Surrey,
*  in British Columbia.
*  And so it was clear that he had some stature in his community there and that he was very involved
*  in advocacy.
*  But that advocacy that he was involved, the Indian government actually sees that as terrorism.
*  Oh wow.
*  Okay, so talk to me about that.
*  So the cause that Mr. Najjar was advocating for is called Khalistan, which is basically
*  the creation of a country, an independent country for the Sikhs from what is the Indian state of
*  Punjab.
*  And this cause has been around for decades actually.
*  It goes back to the moment that India was partitioned when the British colonial rule ended.
*  India was divided into a nation for the Muslims, which became Pakistan, and the Sikhs in Punjab,
*  they stood up and sections of the Sikhs stood up and said,
*  we want similarly another country along religious lines for ourselves called Khalistan.
*  And the Sikhs are a religious minority in India, but in this one state in Punjab,
*  they're a majority.
*  So they wanted to turn Punjab into an independent nation called Khalistan.
*  And that wasn't something that they got at the time, but this cause remained as an insurgency
*  and it climaxed in a very violent period in the 1980s in Punjab.
*  And what happened in the 1980s?
*  So the advocates of Khalistan grew bolder in the 1980s.
*  A group of armed Khalistani militants moved into the Golden Temple,
*  which is the holiest site of Sikhism in Punjab.
*  And they barricaded themselves in there and Indira Gandhi, who was a prime minister,
*  she was known as the Iron Lady of India.
*  And for Mrs. Gandhi's government, that was an affront that she wanted to crush.
*  And so she sent in the commandos to clear them from the temple.
*  From a distance, an uneasy calm appeared to have settled over the Golden Temple,
*  but close up the effects of the 10-day siege between Sikh extremists and soldiers were apparent.
*  But that resulted in hundreds of people dead inside the temple.
*  Two corpses had to be retrieved from the sacred lake, which was now be drained and refilled.
*  And that really incensed a lot of the wider Sikh population.
*  The feeling was that Mrs. Gandhi had used disproportionate violence
*  in how she cracked down on that.
*  And that her government had moved against the wider Sikh population rather than
*  this small, extreme minority that wanted an independent country.
*  And as she was on her way one morning, leaving her residence
*  to her office, two Sikh bodyguards basically stepped in and shot her dead.
*  As the country started 12 official days of mourning, violence mixed with grief.
*  And that unleashed a period of widespread, indiscriminate violence against Sikhs in India.
*  Scores of cars belonging to Sikhs were burned.
*  Most taxi drivers in Delhi are Sikhs, proving easy targets for angered Hindus.
*  And the ruling party at the time, the Congress party, was complicit in this
*  because they made it clear that this was revenge for the assassination of Mrs. Gandhi.
*  And it was pogroms basically in Sikh neighborhoods.
*  All the men in the houses were dragged out, knifed and set on fire.
*  Those who resisted were hacked to pieces.
*  The army is out in force trying to keep what beast they can
*  in a city and country, sliding perilously close to civil war.
*  And that period of the 80s has remained a wound that the community carries.
*  So there's this explosive period of violence against ordinary Sikhs,
*  people who had nothing to do with the political demands of the movement.
*  What happens with the movement after that?
*  Well, the movement is actually largely crushed in India and in Punjab in particular.
*  But what we see in that period also is a increased migration out of India,
*  because on the one hand, India's economy was struggling at that time.
*  So there's a lot of economic migration.
*  But a lot of Sikhs from Punjab leave with this wound that
*  the Indian state was prejudiced against them.
*  So a large number of Sikhs start settling in countries like Australia, the US, the UK,
*  but particularly in Canada, because the Canadians had changed their immigration laws,
*  they've become much more open, I think, since the late 60s and 70s.
*  So a large number of Sikhs settle in Canada to a point that Canada is the second place
*  after India with the largest Sikh population in the world.
*  Wow.
*  So what happened was that although this cause of separatism was squashed in India,
*  the sentiment remained alive in these diasporas among parts of the Sikh community that settled there.
*  So Nijar is an example of this.
*  He moved to Canada in the 1990s.
*  He was a leader in the Sikh community and supported the creation of an independent state.
*  So what was he actually doing to further that?
*  So one of the main things that he was involved in was this idea of a referendum for Khalistan.
*  So this is basically a vote on Canadian soil for the creation of a nation out of a piece of India.
*  So it has no bearing on the ground in India.
*  Right.
*  But it was basically a tactic to try to keep as many Sikhs interested in this idea of an
*  independent nation as possible, to get them to actually to a ballot box to vote for this
*  imagination.
*  And so when the Canadians are seeing his activities, they see a man running around
*  with pamphlets and organizing and mobilizing voters.
*  Most of it sort of feels under protected speech in Canada.
*  Right.
*  He's just doing vote activity.
*  He's just doing vote activity.
*  Yes, for an idea that is separatism, but it's an idea.
*  Right.
*  But what the Indians see is not just a nonviolent protest movement for this cause.
*  They see a movement that is tied to a lot of violence.
*  In fact, in the 1980s, it was members of this movement that blew up an Air India flight that
*  had taken off from Canada and was flying to London midair and causing the deaths of more
*  than 300 people.
*  Then people like Mr. Najjar in more recent years, the Indian government have accused him of
*  having roles in violence and bombings and killings in India.
*  The Indian officials say that we've expressed this to Canadians repeatedly,
*  to a point that a couple of years ago, the Indians declared him a terrorist
*  and that they had wanted his extradition from the Canadian government.
*  So it was two different narratives around the same man.
*  So I guess it kind of makes sense why Trudeau would have suspected India of killing Najjar.
*  But did Trudeau offer any proof that it actually was India?
*  Like when he gave his announcement in parliament, what evidence did he show?
*  So that's where the problem is.
*  He didn't offer any details.
*  There's been no proof or evidence that's been offered publicly.
*  And India has unequivocally denied this.
*  They said, this is not what we do.
*  But they're also saying that there are terrorists, that there are terrorist sympathizers
*  on Canadian grounds and the Canadian government is not taking any action.
*  So this has all caused this diplomatic row now where the Canadians expelled
*  a senior Indian diplomat in reaction.
*  The Indians expelled a senior Canadian diplomat and trade ties between the two countries have
*  been paused.
*  There are travel advisories flying left and right and the relationship between
*  these two countries is the lowest it's ever been.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Mujib, you described India's response to Trudeau's allegation, which was essentially
*  they're denying it.
*  They're saying, absolutely, this was not us.
*  But at the same time, they're saying Canada is sheltering terrorists.
*  So what does that dual response reveal about India in this moment?
*  In many ways, it's a reflection of domestic politics in this country.
*  Prime Minister Modi has projected this image of a strongman protector of a country.
*  And to do that, you usually need a threat that you're protecting the country against.
*  And that's been very beneficial to him.
*  In 2019, when he was struggling politically, what helped him gain a sweeping victory was
*  this bombing that happened in Kashmir and it was tied to Pakistan.
*  And he created a whole nationalist movement against that.
*  And he won sweepingly.
*  So his solid position at the top has as much dependent on protecting against threats.
*  And this idea of Khalistan fits nicely in that as well.
*  We've seen in the past two, three years, it's actually come very handy that in the biggest
*  political challenge Mr. Modi faced in his 10 years in power was this farmers' protest.
*  A majority of those farmers were Sikhs from Punjab.
*  They were just average citizens of India protesting against a farm bill that they didn't agree
*  with. But what Mr. Modi's officials did was often they labeled those farmers as
*  Khalistanis, essentially as separatist terrorists.
*  So it left the sense that sometimes the government wants to stoke the extent of this threat
*  because it feeds into the political need of a threat to protect against.
*  And now as this episode plays up, there's an election coming up in a few months where
*  Mr. Modi is seeking a third term.
*  And it increasingly appears that in the election season, this will be a conversation as well.
*  But what Trudeau is accusing Modi's government of is not using rhetoric to excite his base.
*  He's accusing Modi's government of murder, of killing a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil.
*  Absolutely. But the accusation of this violence doesn't actually put off Modi's supporters
*  and how it plays out in the domestic politics here.
*  And why is that?
*  Because the Hindu nationalist vision that has brought Modi to power, in that vision,
*  there is this idea that for a long time, because of Muslim invasions,
*  because of the British colonial rule, Hindus were emasculated in this country.
*  Now that they've had a chance to reshape this country, that needs to be a strong vision where
*  violence actually does have a role.
*  That you do use violence to pursue your goals and to show strength.
*  Modi embodies that personally in how he projects that strength.
*  But using violence as a tool for power is very clearly vocalized in that vision.
*  That this accusation that Modi's government may have done this,
*  if anything, would help politically rather than hurt.
*  So you're saying that Modi isn't actually facing any repercussions domestically because
*  the accusation of violence itself doesn't hurt Modi?
*  If one was to read the reaction over the past couple of days in the domestic debate here,
*  that is exactly the point you'd be left with.
*  That that violence doesn't hurt him, that violence further cements his image of a strong man
*  who would use any tool to protect his country.
*  S1 But what about the response outside of India?
*  What about India's Western allies say, isn't there a risk that this could cause some
*  response on their part?
*  Sanctions, punishment of some sort?
*  Modi Well, actually the response has been pretty muted.
*  Even among these countries known as the Five Eyes,
*  essentially partners of Canada that Canada shares intelligence with, the United States,
*  Australia, the UK, when we thought that at least the Canadians would have shared the evidence they
*  have with those countries and would see a strong reaction, their reaction has been muted as well.
*  They've been saying, we are concerned, but we'll see where the investigations lead.
*  They're not coming out as unequivocally as Canada would have hoped.
*  And a large part of that reason is from the US to the UK to France and Germany,
*  everybody's trying to court India.
*  In this moment of huge tensions with China, the West has been looking to India as sort
*  of a counterbalance.
*  And that need is so massive that a lot of these Western powers have been looking away
*  from some of the things that India has been doing.
*  So that has created the sense of confidence for India that we are so indispensable,
*  not just because of that counterbalance to China, but also because of a rise as a large economy
*  that we can get away with a lot, that a lot of things that would ruffle feathers in the past
*  might not do so anymore.
*  And how muted the response of some of these Canadian allies have been over the past couple
*  days only plays into that Indian confidence more.
*  I mean, listening to you talk about this, it also sounds like Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau is
*  kind of out on his own here.
*  No one's coming out and supporting him.
*  He's alone.
*  Absolutely.
*  And this will test how far Prime Minister Trudeau pushes it because he's put his reputation
*  on the line.
*  And his convincing powers of how much he can rally his allies will be tested here because
*  the Indian pushback has been very obvious.
*  There hasn't been a sign that the Indian government wants to cooperate in the face of
*  such a major accusation.
*  So now that Prime Minister Trudeau has gone all out with it, it is a test of what can he
*  really achieve with it.
*  So stepping back here, investigations like this, of course, can take years, and we may never know
*  the answer to whether India was behind the killing.
*  But in some ways, Modi may have just learned that in effect, he could get away with it, that the
*  wrath of what the Western allies would not come crashing down on him because of where India is in
*  the world right now.
*  It's economic promise.
*  It's counterbalance to China.
*  These things in some ways give it a kind of get out of jail free card.
*  Exactly.
*  And even this moment of pushing back against Canada's accusation is almost being seen in
*  India by the Indian government as a way of proving your strength at the world stage right now.
*  That we are positioned so strongly with ties to the powers that we can get away with anything.
*  This may be overcoming an accusation, or it may be actually a hand in committing a murder.
*  We don't know which one it is, but even overcoming this Canadian accusation
*  is being used as a point of showing strength.
*  Mujeeb, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The fix is in.
*  There's one investigation protecting President Biden.
*  There's another one attacking President Trump.
*  Justice Department's got both sides of the equation covered.
*  During a heated and partisan hearing in Congress on Wednesday,
*  House Republicans pushed Attorney General Merrick Garland to explain what they see as the unfair
*  ways in which his office has handled the federal prosecutions of former President Trump and
*  President Biden's son, Hunter Biden.
*  I guess I'm just wondering, Mr. Attorney General,
*  has anyone at the department told President Biden to knock it off with Hunter?
*  Our job in the Justice Department is to pursue our cases without reference
*  to what's happening in the outside world.
*  But just yes or no? Have you done that?
*  That is what we do.
*  So it's a no?
*  No one that I know of has spoken to the White House about the Hunter Biden case.
*  I'm wondering that.
*  Or not.
*  Okay, I got it.
*  Garland, who was repeatedly interrupted by Republicans as he testified,
*  told them that his office has never interfered in the Hunter Biden investigation
*  and has followed the letter of the law in its prosecution of former President Trump.
*  I am not the president's lawyer.
*  I will add, I am not Congress's prosecutor.
*  The Justice Department works for the American people.
*  Our job is to follow the facts and the law.
*  And that is what we do.
*  And with COVID infections on the rise,
*  the Biden administration will spend $600 million
*  to revive a program that offers free COVID tests through the mail.
*  Starting on Monday of next week, every American household can begin requesting
*  up to four tests at covidtests.gov.
