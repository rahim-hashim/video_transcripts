# Bernie Sanders Says Democrats Have Lost Their Way
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvYvfOcEFXI)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  As the Democratic Party sifts through the rubble of its sweeping electoral loss and
*  tries to chart a path back to power, few people have as clear-eyed a diagnosis as Senator
*  Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which is why I gave him a call.
*  It's Friday, November 15th.
*  Hello?
*  Senator Sanders.
*  Yes.
*  Michael Bavaro.
*  Hey, Michael. How are you?
*  Very well. I reached Senator Sanders inside his office on Capitol Hill on Thursday morning.
*  You may not remember this, but the last time you and I spoke was back in 2020. We were
*  in the same room and we were working on a profile of you focused on your earliest days
*  in public office as mayor of Burlington.
*  Oh.
*  It's not as vivid a memory for you, apparently, as it is for me.
*  Was it a good story?
*  I thought it was a good story. We had our moments, you and I, in that interview, and
*  we don't need to reconstruct the whole thing, but there was a pointed moment where you were
*  frustrated with something I asked. You almost got up and left, but then you decided to stay.
*  All right. Let's do better this time.
*  Moving on. I just want to begin, Senator, by asking for your reaction to the news of
*  the past 24 hours that Republicans have taken control of the House, because what that means
*  is that Republicans now control both chambers and the White House. You are about to be in
*  the minority as President-elect Trump brings a very aggressive agenda to Congress, an agenda,
*  frankly, that Democrats have called, among other things, a threat to democracy. How are
*  you processing that?
*  Well, obviously, our job is to rally the American people, to make it clear, especially to working
*  people, that we need an economy and a government that works for all to expose as best we can
*  what Trump and his administration are doing. But it's not just an inside the beltway game.
*  It's a question of rallying the American people to fight back effectively.
*  So you're in a fighting mood.
*  Oh, absolutely. I think right now is this is a pivotal moment in American history. And
*  the next year or two will determine what happens in this country for decades, in my view.
*  Fighting mood or not, are there any areas where you are prepared to work with the President-elect?
*  Absolutely.
*  And what might those be?
*  If Trump, for example, follows through on his proposal to limit interest rates on credit
*  cards to 10%, which is what he campaigned on. Absolutely, I will be there. I think that's
*  a very good idea. I think it's time we told the people on Wall Street they cannot charge
*  a desperate working class people who can't have a hard time paying their bills 25, 30,
*  40% interest rates. That's usurious. That's immoral. And if Trump wants to impose a credit
*  card limit on interest rates, I'll be there.
*  So where your vision of championing the working class overlaps with his, you may back his agenda.
*  If he comes up with reasonable ideas, yes, I would be interested in working with him.
*  Let's turn to what I think is going to be the heart of this conversation, Senator Sanders,
*  which is the effort underway across the Democratic Party, and you're a big part of it, of reckoning
*  with the meaning of the outcome of this election and understanding not just why Kamala Harris
*  didn't win, but why Donald Trump in victory expanded his electoral reach into communities
*  of color, into America's youth, into blue state America, including your own home state
*  of Vermont, where when you look at the New York Times graphic, you see those red arrows
*  suggesting his support deepened since he last ran. Donald Trump has created the most
*  racially and politically diverse coalition of any Republican in a generation. And you
*  have participated, as I said, in the post-mortem underway across the Democratic Party. And
*  I just want to read something you have said that a lot of people, when they read it, found
*  very bracing. This is what you said. Quote, it should come as no great surprise that a
*  Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that working class
*  people have abandoned them. And you went on to say, first, this abandonment was among
*  white working class Americans. Now, it is Latino and black workers as well. While the
*  Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and they want
*  And they're right. I want you to just explain what you mean and be very specific, if you
*  can, when you say that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working class. When and
*  how did the Democratic Party abandon the working class?
*  Well, it's something that's been going on for decades, including disastrous trade policies
*  pushed by Bill Clinton.
*  You're talking about NAFTA.
*  Yeah, that's right. The reality is the American people, or many of them, are angry and they
*  have every reason to be angry. Today in America, and sometimes some of the elite does not understand
*  this, today in America, 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. I grew up
*  in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. I understand the stress involved in that.
*  It means that if your car breaks down, you don't know how you get to work. If you get
*  sick, you don't know whether or not you can afford to go to a doctor. If your landlord
*  raises rent by 20%, you don't know where you're going to live, where your kid is going to
*  go to school. That's the reality facing 60% of the American people. Meanwhile, the very
*  wealthiest people in this country have never ever had it so good. That's a reality. So
*  what happened in this campaign is Donald Trump said to the American people, you're angry,
*  you're really pissed off, and I know that, and you're right. And then he gave his explanation.
*  And his explanation, which was obviously nonsense and false and racist, et cetera, was that
*  millions and millions of undocumented people were coming across the border. They were invading
*  America or an occupied country. They were taking your jobs, taking your benefits, eating
*  your cats and your dogs. That is why you are hurting. Now, that is a crazy explanation,
*  but it is an explanation. Now you tell me what the Democratic explanation was.
*  Well, please, please, please explore that. Map this critique onto the Democratic campaign
*  and its shortcomings.
*  Well, the Democratic explanation was, hey, we have passed some good things, very important
*  things in the Biden administration, which happens to be true. Biden kept his word. He
*  was the most progressive president on domestic issues since FDL. We did a lot of good things.
*  But instead of saying, yeah, we are rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, we're lowering
*  the cost of prescription drugs. We are transforming our energy system. We forgave student death
*  for five million people, making some progress. But we have a long, long way to go.
*  Wait, can I just pause you? Because I think I'm not certain I'm understanding something.
*  Where did the campaign of Kamala Harris go wrong if it was working with what you're describing
*  as the building blocks of a successful policy agenda? And I know that you have said many,
*  many times.
*  It's not just Kamala Harris. It's the Democrats. In other words, let me read you something,
*  if I might.
*  Please.
*  What I think is one of the most interesting speeches ever given. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
*  inaugural speech in 1936, middle of the Depression. So he starts his speech. He says, look, these
*  are the things we did. These are the obstacles that we had to overcome. And then he says,
*  after being president for four years, he says that, I quote, I see millions of families
*  trying to live on income so meagre that the fall of family disaster hangs over them day
*  by day. I see millions of night education, recreation, and the opportunity to better
*  their lot and a lot of their children. I see one third of a nation ill housed, ill clad,
*  ill nourished, end quote. In other words, what Roosevelt did is said, look, we're making
*  progress. But I look out all over this country and I see tens of millions of people who are
*  hurting. Instead of doing that, the Democrats said, well, we passed the inflation adjustment
*  act and the economy is pretty good. And Donald Trump's a bad guy. We all defend the woman's
*  constitutional right to an abortion. There was no appreciation, no appreciation of the
*  struggling and the suffering of millions and millions of working class people. And unless
*  you recognize that reality and have a vision of how you get out of that, I think you're
*  not going to be going very far as a political party.
*  You're saying that the party in this last election didn't communicate that they understood
*  Americans pain. As a result, they came off as defending the status quo. And I mean, I
*  don't think it's a stretch to suggest that Kamala Harris was asked repeatedly what she
*  would do differently in this campaign and pretty much said she didn't think anything
*  needed to be done differently. And she didn't campaign on disruption or large scale change.
*  You seem to be suggesting that's at the heart of Trump's victory.
*  The point that I am making is that ordinary people are not stupid. They see what's going
*  on in their own eyes. And if you're not even talking about the reality of what is going
*  on, the reality of their lives, because hey, no change is going to come. Why would I want
*  to vote for a group of people who don't even acknowledge the reality? For example, you
*  tell me you follow these things. I do. We have today more income and wealth inequality
*  than we've ever had in the history of this country. Did you hear a lot of discussion
*  on that? No.
*  We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people is
*  a human right and the only major country not to provide paid family and medical leave.
*  Do you hear much discussion on that? Not in this campaign.
*  Not in this campaign. You've got 20 million people in America today who are trying to
*  get by on less than $15 an hour. Did you hear any serious discussion of the need to raise
*  the minimum wage to a living wage? I don't think we did.
*  Oh, miss that one too. Why do you think, Senator Sanders, that Democrats
*  didn't communicate an understanding of his pain? I mean, one of the ongoing critiques
*  of the Democratic Party that emerged since this election is that it is a party of elites
*  captive to college educated coastal America and that it's not understanding and communicating
*  this pain because it's not living that pain. Well, that's only half of it. It is not beholden
*  to college educated people. That's the wrong word. Okay.
*  It is beholden to the donors who put hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into it
*  and to the bloody consultants out there who will end up this campaign making zillions
*  of dollars doing their 30 second TV ads rather than figuring out how we talk reality to ordinary
*  people and get them involved in the political process.
*  Senator, I want to talk about what Democrats did talk about in this last campaign because
*  I think it may get to a second element of your critique aside from big money and aside
*  from the question of whether Democrats failed to communicate an understanding of working
*  class American pain. And in your second critique of Democrats in this moment was around identity.
*  And I want to read what you said about identity politics. And just to define this phrase,
*  I think what you mean is a focus on racial identity, sexual identity, among others. This is what you said.
*  You said it's not just Kamala Harris. It's a Democratic Party, which increasingly has become
*  a party of identity politics rather than understanding that the vast majority of people in this country
*  are working class. This trend of workers leaving the Democratic Party and you return to this theme
*  started with whites and it has accelerated to Latinos and blacks. When I hear you say that,
*  I hear you saying, and I want to make sure I'm interpreting it correctly, that the Democratic
*  Party, including over the past year or so in this campaign, has turned off many working class Americans
*  who feel that the way the Democratic Party, especially its leaders, talk about things like
*  race and gender and trans people leaves them feeling alienated from that conversation,
*  being policed and even scolded by it for not using the right words, for not accepting something like
*  trans youth on sports teams. Is that what you mean? That's part of it, but I think the more important
*  point is being ignored. Their needs are being ignored. And let me be very clear. Where the
*  Democratic Party deserves a lot of credit over the last many decades is in fact leading the effort
*  for women's rights. And we have come a long way until Roe v. Wade, as a matter of fact.
*  And the Democratic Party deserves a lot of credit for fighting for civil rights,
*  for fighting for gay rights, for fighting to end bigotry, all forms of bigotry in this country.
*  Democrats were right on that struggle. But you can go forward in both directions. You can say,
*  we are going to fight for a bigotry-free America. That's an ongoing struggle. We made progress.
*  We've got a long way to go. But at the same time, we can stand up for the working class of this
*  country, which by the way, happens to be significantly African American and Latino
*  and women who are the bulk of the working class in this country. So it's not either or. It's going
*  forward in both directions. That is a winner. Some of the Democrat pundits say, well, you know,
*  the problem is all of these Trump people are racists and they're sexist and they're homophobes. Well,
*  no doubt that some of them are. And that's true. Most of them are not. And I suspect many of them
*  actually voted for the first black president in American history, Barack Obama. All right. But
*  they are in large numbers, working class people. And we've got to speak to them in an economic
*  perspective that is clear and straightforward. I guess I'm a touch confused by the answer you
*  just gave because your quote about identity politics seemed to suggest that the Democratic
*  Party's focus on identity is in some opposition to its ability to appeal to working class
*  voters who may feel turned off about that. But then in your answer, I felt a little bit of a retreat
*  from that understanding. I know it's not a retreat. It's not a retreat. You can say, look, isn't it
*  great that we have, in fact, a very smart and effective black woman who's on the Supreme Court?
*  Great. But you don't hang your head on that and say, hey, well, what you also want to do is talk
*  about the reality of what's going on in the African American community all over this country.
*  So it's a matter of communicating that perhaps the Democratic core values are things like
*  diversity, but not to the exclusion of these central questions of economics.
*  It's not either or. It is both. And you have to decide what is the vision of the Democratic Party?
*  Who is the Democratic Party taking on? You tell me, Michael. In this campaign,
*  Donald Trump was taking on, I mean, every day there was another enemy out there. But by and large,
*  the basic problem was millions of illegal immigrants coming in who were eating our cats
*  and dogs, and they were the enemy. You're going to solve that problem. Everything would be great.
*  What was the Democratic Party taking on in the campaign?
*  I mean, what was their explanation? What were they going to do to address the fact that so
*  many people in America are struggling? That it have anything to do with the greed of corporate
*  America? The fact that you have a billionaire class today that wants it all, they want to own
*  the political system? Does anyone really talk about the degree to which the people on top own
*  this country and want more and more and could give a damn about ordinary Americans? Now,
*  that is what I believe, unlike Trump. That's what I believe the cause of our problems are.
*  I believe that we can create a nation in which all people have health care, all kids have good
*  quality child care. We have a strong public education system. I believe we can do that,
*  but we're not going to do it unless we are able to take on the big money interests who want to
*  use this economy to make themselves even richer than they are right now. That is the defining
*  issue. To go back just a second, you seem very clear on the idea that the Democratic Party can
*  be a party that embraces diversity as a core value and even elements of what you described
*  as identity politics. But I just wonder if you can grapple with the reality that Donald Trump's
*  message in opposition to things like diversity, equity, and inclusion, holding it up as a bogeyman
*  and suggesting that it is unfair and that Democrats want to bring that unfairness and make it more and
*  more central to the country's identity seem to resonate in this election. Well, it resonates
*  within the context of Democrats not recognizing the pain that ordinary people are feeling
*  and taking on the people who caused that pain and routing people around an agenda that works
*  for them. You know, you can't fight something with nothing. You got to have an alternative vision.
*  Trump had his vision. It was incorrect. It was dishonest. It was, in many cases, racist and
*  sexist. He had a vision. He had an explanation. To my view, Democrats really did not.
*  We'll be right back.
*  I want to press a little bit further into this question of Democratic leadership being out of
*  touch with the working class and not meeting voters where they are. You've started to clearly
*  articulate this when you criticized the Democrats for not appreciating and communicating the pain
*  of America's working class. But another element of this emerging Democratic critiques since election
*  day is that Democrats have drawn what some are saying is unnecessary lines in the sand
*  about where they go to have this conversation in the first place. When you were a candidate
*  for president, you had no problem going on shows like Joe Rogan's. He ended up backing you for
*  president in 2016. In this campaign, Joe Rogan invited all the candidates on his show.
*  Donald Trump said yes. J.D. Vance said yes. Tens of millions of people saw it.
*  Vice President Harris declined that invitation to go on the show. We suspect in part because they
*  worried about blowback from Democrats who don't like Rogan. They think he's insensitive. He's not
*  one of them. Since then, we found that some voters viewed that Rogan interview with Trump as kind of
*  decisive in their decision to vote for Trump. Are Democrats writing off too many places and
*  too many mediums in this moment and making a mistake in their ability to reach working
*  class voters where they are? Well, funny you ask that, Michael. I am thinking back to when
*  I ran for president in 2020 and I did an interview with the New York Times. You work for the New York
*  Times. I do. And we did an interview with the editorial board of the New York Times,
*  of which I think they gave each member 20 members or so, I don't remember, two votes apiece. Right?
*  I was either ahead or in second place in the polls at that time. And of the 40 votes that were cast,
*  I got one of the votes. That was what the New York Times thought of my campaign. And yet here I am on
*  your show, as an employee of the New York Times. Am I afraid of being on your show? I am not. Am I
*  afraid of being on Joe Rogan's show? No. Bottom line is what every communications director knows
*  is that there is a new world of media out there. And it's not just NBC, CBS, or the New York Times.
*  It is podcasts. It is Joe Rogan. It is Fox News. It is young people who nobody in the
*  Democratic leadership has ever heard of who have YouTube programs that attract millions of people.
*  That is the reality. Can you ignore that? That is insane. Anyone who thinks you could ignore that
*  reality is crazy. In my experience, not that I've been on millions of these shows, the people that
*  I talk to treat me with respect. And I think you cannot be, you know, oh, Joe Rogan said this or he
*  says that. Yeah, so what? You know, my wife disagrees with me on this or that issue. So what?
*  You can't run away from somebody because they may have said something stupid or something that you
*  disagree with. That's life. But most importantly, when you go on the show, what do you say?
*  So Joe Rogan asked you, what do you think about the fact that we have more income and wealth
*  inequality than ever before? Oh, well, I can't answer that question. What do you think about
*  the fact that we're the only major country not to guarantee health care? Well, gee, I'd like to not
*  talk about that. But I don't want to offend the insurance companies. Why are we paying the highest
*  prices in the world for prescription drugs? Well, I can't talk about that because, you know,
*  I get money from the pharma. That's the problem. So, yeah, you got to go on different outlets. Of
*  course you do. But most importantly, you got to know what you believe and what you're prepared
*  to fight for and what your vision for the future of this country is. Do you think that the Democratic
*  Party is really prepared to go where it needs to go in taking the lessons that you're laying out here
*  and really moving ahead with them? I don't know if you know that former speaker Nancy Pelosi came on
*  a podcast by our colleague Lulu Garcia Navarro and was presented with your critique word for word of
*  the Democratic Party. And if I can put it politely, she dismissed it and said, well, I completely
*  disagree with what he's saying. By the way, Kamala Harris did better than, you know, Senator Sanders
*  in Vermont on Election Day. She pointed out you've lost your races for president and Democratic
*  primaries. Well, I tell you, I got 63% of the vote and I didn't spend one nickel on advertising
*  in Vermont. How's that? Look, I respect Nancy and we've known each other for years and we've worked
*  together on some issues like the American Rescue Plan, which I thought was a very consequential
*  piece of legislation. But, you know, Nancy and I have different visions as to the future. I think
*  Nancy's views may reverberate here inside the Beltway. I'm sure a lot of the pundits, the
*  consultants and politicians agree with Nancy. I suspect if you go out into the hinterlands,
*  you'll find that most people agree with me. Senator, looking forward to not just the idea
*  that the party will take what you're saying and perhaps run with it, but that it needs to be
*  embodied in a candidate who can win. When you close your eyes and think of who can lead
*  the party out of this very decisive and for many Democrats devastating loss,
*  what do you see? Not necessarily who do you see. Maybe there is a who in your mind, but
*  what is that future candidate? Look, it's a candidate, preferably, but not necessarily
*  somebody from the working class who can speak to working class people, who will fight to end all
*  forms of bigotry in this country, but is mostly prepared to take on the big money interests who
*  today have an unprecedented level of economic and political power. With the advent of all the new
*  technologies out there, Michael, in terms of artificial intelligence, in terms of robotics,
*  etc., we truthfully have the capability now of creating a society where all of our people
*  have a decent standard of living. Yeah, we can actually wipe out poverty. We don't need to have
*  people sleeping out on the streets. The question is, who will control the utilization of that
*  technology and who will benefit from it? So we need to have somebody who primarily is prepared
*  to stand up to the ruling class of America and say, you know what, we'd like your entrepreneurial
*  capabilities, but you've got to control your greed. You can no longer have it all.
*  You're going to be an important part of the future, but you're not going to own and control
*  the future. We need somebody like that. Do you think that if Democrats do meet voters
*  where they are and connect with the pain and they pitch the kind of progressive policies
*  that you're advocating for here, especially on economics, that is the winning combination
*  or has trust in the Democratic Party, for a lot of the reasons we've been talking about here,
*  been strained, if not broken in a way that means that even getting it right here is not really
*  possible? Well, that's a very good question. Because there's been a huge loss of faith in
*  government. That's right. That's right. You're right on that. And I will tell you that even
*  within the confines of the Democratic caucus, and I don't talk about things that happen behind
*  closed doors, but you'll have Democrats, US senators standing up and saying, you know what,
*  they hate us out there. Us, the government or the party? Well, they hate the party and they
*  understand and you're onto another issue, which we don't have time to get into right now. Even
*  when government does the right thing, you got a bureaucracy, which is so slow in implementation
*  of policy that people don't see it when they should be seeing it. But that's a whole other issue.
*  It's another issue and perhaps another conversation. But if people don't have
*  faith in government, how do your solutions, which do require a tremendous role for our government,
*  how do you sell them? Well, that's, that's, that's again, a good question. And I think
*  here's where we're at. The Elon Musk of the world will say, look, government can't do anything. It's
*  going to be the private sector. Cut it, cut it, cut it is his message, right? Right. And you know,
*  look, Elon Musk is a very, very aggressive and capable business person, very impressive
*  at what he's accomplished. And he says, I could do more in a week than the government can do in,
*  you know, five years. In some ways he is right. The problem is at the end of his efforts, he ends
*  up making zillions of dollars and working class people are not any better off. All right. The
*  alternative is to say, Oh, let the government do it right now. But you've got a government that
*  inefficient and bureaucratic. Right. So people are looking at say, all right, we've got the greed
*  of the ruling class. They do things pretty well, but they end up with all the money and the working
*  class ends up with the lowest standard of living than the youth staff, or you got a government,
*  which is very slow in doing anything. So that that is, it seems to me, where we are as a nation,
*  we got to do better than that. What's the answer? The answer is to bring young people into government
*  who believe in a mission to improve the lives of people, whether you work in the post office,
*  whether you work in the veterans administration, whether you work in social security, pay these
*  people well, give them good management, let them be proud of the important work that they do.
*  No more important work in this country than being a public school teacher. All right. Yet we under
*  pay those teachers, we put them under terrible working conditions. Choices got to be to modernize
*  government, make government work for ordinary people, health care for all of the human rights.
*  If other countries around the world can have national health care programs,
*  so can the United States of America. We're not dumb under the people.
*  I have a final question for you. Yeah. When Trump won last time, many Democrats organized themselves
*  into what was loosely described, sometimes by them as the resistance. That resistance,
*  many Democrats now think, ended up pushing the party further and further to the left,
*  leading to things like a primary in 2020 in which people like Kamala Harris made commitments
*  to left-wing causes that came back to haunt her and made it possible.
*  Well, now you're onto another. Michael, you're dead wrong.
*  This is my final question. Do you worry that the party could be heading down that path again?
*  Michael, you haven't heard a word that I said. And that's impressive. The things that Kamala
*  was talking about, the things that I was talking about, every one of those issues
*  is enormously popular. Is that what you're talking about?
*  No, no, no. I mean on social issues. Oh, I don't know. Social issues, you know,
*  achieve, I don't know. Yeah. Setting Kamala aside, I think what
*  you're about to tell me is, Michael, many of the economic issues on the left are very popular with
*  many Americans as economic policy. Yeah, we oppose them all. In Missouri,
*  you may have followed in this election, Missouri, a conservative state, 58% of the people voted to
*  raise the minimum wage. Oh, by the way, we haven't been able to do that here in a
*  democratically controlled US Senate. When those policies were in isolation on the
*  ballot separate from a Democratic party and candidate carrying all the baggage that we're
*  talking about here. Well, the point is if Democrats were focusing on those issues and saying, gee,
*  how come that one Republican wants to raise the minimum wage to at least 15 bucks an hour?
*  How come one Republican doesn't believe that health care is a human right? How come one
*  Republican doesn't want to expand social security so that the elderly people can live their lives
*  with dignity? You put them on the defensive, but when you don't offer anything, you are on the
*  defensive. Right. I mean, it's worth saying that many of those Missouri voters voted for those
*  progressive economic policies as ballot measures and then turned around and voted for Trump,
*  which means it's deeper than policy. Well, maybe next time we'll go into that.
*  No, it's not deeper than policy. Senator, I know you have to go. I don't know if you've been
*  thinking about this, but you're 83. And thanks, Michael. I did know that. See, this is a percept
*  of New York Times investigative reporter. I got to do that. Here we go. But running for president,
*  depending on the moment and the candidate, can be a very age defiant question. And you still
*  sound like a candidate for president to me. I mean, is it totally out of the question?
*  Yeah. Yes, I don't think the American people want to present it as 104 years of age. So, you know,
*  you'd be 87. All right. Well, the answer is I would say it's, you know, I'm very proud that
*  the people of Vermont in very large numbers reelected me for a fourth term. I'm very proud
*  of that. And that's where we are. All right. Senator, thank you for your time. Thank you. Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. President-elect Trump said he would nominate
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department, giving a vocal skeptic of
*  vaccines, responsibility for the nation's vast system of public health. If Kennedy is confirmed,
*  his resistance to public health measures and his embrace of alternative medicine
*  could lead to fierce clashes with the agencies that he would oversee.
*  And on Thursday, the governor of New York dramatically revived a First in the Nation plan
*  to fund mass transit by tolling cars in Manhattan's busiest neighborhoods.
*  And I'm proud to announce we have found a path to find the MTA, reduce congestion,
*  and keep millions of dollars in the pockets of our commuters.
*  Governor Kathy Hochul said that the program, known as congestion pricing, would begin in January
*  with a toll of $9 per car, down from the original price tag of $15 per car. Hochul had canceled the
*  plan over the summer because she argued that original toll was too high.
*  Remember, you can catch a new episode of the interview right here tomorrow.
*  This week, David Marchese talks with Dr. Ellen Weed, a longtime advocate for,
*  and practitioner of, medical assistance in dying.
*  Sometimes I struggle when I see a young, beautiful person choosing to leave earlier than they needed
*  to. But I believe so strongly in basic human rights. If that person says that
*  they can't live in with this condition, I will honor their wishes.
*  Today's episode was produced by Jessica Chung, Michael Simon Johnson, and Nina Feldman. It was
*  edited by Paige Cowitt, Lisa Chow, and Patricia Willens, with help from Michael Benoit, contains
*  original music by Marion Lozano and Pat McCusker, and was engineered by Chris Wood. Our theme music
*  is by Jim Runberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonderlay. Special thanks to Lexi Diel, Lisa Lair, Reid Epstein,
*  and Shane Goldmacher.
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Waboro. See you on Monday.
