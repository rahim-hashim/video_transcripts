# Will Biden Withdraw?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfBq5v7biS0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroweth.
*  This is The Daily.
*  President Joe Biden's disastrous debate performance last week set off a furious discussion among
*  Democratic officials, donors, and strategists about whether and how to replace him as their
*  party's nominee.
*  Today, Chief White House correspondent Peter Baker takes us inside those discussions and
*  Biden's effort to shut that conversation down.
*  It's Monday, July 1st.
*  Peter, you've been reporting on what I think can be best described as the great Democratic
*  freakout that started basically from the moment the debate began at 9 p.m. on Thursday night.
*  Tell us about the aftermath.
*  Yeah, I've been covering politics for 38 years and I've never seen a political panic like we
*  saw after that debate.
*  It was like a run on the bank.
*  Everybody in the Democratic Party was suddenly confronted with what they didn't want to admit
*  up until then, which is that they have an 81 year old candidate who will be 86 at the end of a
*  second term.
*  And it's very possible that he was not capable of completing this campaign in a vigorous and
*  competitive way against Donald Trump.
*  That's what really it comes down to for many Democrats.
*  Can Joe Biden take the campaign to Donald Trump and stop what they think is an existential
*  threat to the country?
*  I want to know more about who you were hearing from.
*  Who are the people that are calling you?
*  What are the big questions they're asking?
*  What are they struggling with?
*  Yeah, I don't want to get into too many names.
*  A lot of people don't want to be out front, but you did see even publicly people like Senator
*  Claire McCaskill.
*  Joe Biden had one thing he had to do tonight and he didn't do it.
*  Former senator from Missouri, red state Democrat, was on MSNBC just minutes after the
*  debate.
*  He had one thing he had to accomplish, and that was reassure America that he was up to
*  the job at his age.
*  And he failed at that tonight.
*  She talked about, you know, this was a crisis that her phone was blowing up with a lot of
*  Democrats and she was very forthright about it.
*  It was very striking that she said that.
*  I think there's a lot of people who are going to want to see him consider taking a
*  different course now.
*  People like Van Jones, who was on CNN.
*  He used to work in the Obama White House.
*  We're still far from our convention and there is time for this party to figure out a
*  different way forward if you will allow us to do that.
*  He very candidly talked about how this is going to raise questions about whether the
*  president should continue as the candidate.
*  Some Democrats are calling for Biden to step down.
*  Andrew Yang.
*  Andrew Yang, who ran against Biden in 2020 for the Democratic nomination, popular with
*  some younger voters.
*  He said on social media, it was time for Biden to step aside.
*  Those are some of the public people.
*  And obviously in the hours and days that followed, Moore came out and said, well, this
*  is something we need to think about.
*  But the people I was talking to were people behind the scenes, people who have run
*  White House before, people who work for President Biden in this administration.
*  I heard words like he can't win.
*  This is a disaster.
*  This is a nightmare.
*  And they were very, very concerned that he could not beat Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  And you saw these really prominent media figures, outlets, The Times as an actor in
*  this situation calling for Biden to step aside.
*  Our editorial board did this.
*  We should say this is entirely separate from our newsroom, from the show.
*  But there was this real crescendo and there was a sense that this was a turning point.
*  Right?
*  Absolutely.
*  But it's not just the media.
*  I think what the Biden campaign would like it to be is about the media.
*  It's just that the media tends to be more out front and say things more openly than
*  Democrats were saying.
*  It really was rank and file Democrats.
*  It really was high ranking Democrats.
*  And they were absolutely flipped out.
*  Right.
*  These doubts are coming from all over, from many corners.
*  Take me through, Peter, the argument for why this poor performance meant that
*  Biden should be replaced.
*  How do they explain that thinking?
*  Well, look, what a lot of people who defended President Biden will say is that
*  incumbent presidents don't do well in their first debate.
*  And that is true.
*  Historically, that's been true.
*  Ronald Reagan, George W.
*  Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, all lost, arguably, their first debate when they
*  were running for reelection.
*  But the difference is if Obama, you know, doesn't register a good performance
*  against Mitt Romney, first of all, nobody thought that Obama wasn't capable of
*  being president as a result.
*  And second of all, he had another debate about a week or two later in order to try
*  to recover.
*  Neither of those factors works here.
*  Biden's problem from this debate is much more existential, is much more profound
*  because it's about whether he is able to perform the office of president, not just
*  for the next few months, but for the next four and a half years.
*  And there's not going to be another debate until September.
*  So he doesn't have another big audience opportunity to change people's minds, to
*  show that, in fact, he does still have it and can run the country.
*  And that's a real problem for him.
*  And there's this broader context here, right?
*  Voters have been telling pollsters for a year now that Biden's age is a major
*  concern for them.
*  We've seen Biden's age before our very eyes.
*  We've seen him stumble in speeches and public appearances.
*  And Peter, we had talked to you about this very issue a few months ago after a special
*  council investigating Biden's son, Hunter, issued this report focusing on Biden's
*  mental state, in part saying that the president was, quote, a well-meaning elderly
*  man with a poor memory and had, quote, diminish faculties in advancing age.
*  But at the time, the White House dismissed that report as a partisan hit job.
*  So in a sense, this debate performance was the capstone of something that's been in
*  the air for a very long time.
*  It's just that this time it was undeniable.
*  There was no spinning it.
*  Well, I think that's exactly right.
*  There was no spinning it.
*  One Democrat put it to me.
*  He said, you know, for a long time, the fear of Trump stifled democratic criticism of
*  Biden. People didn't want to criticize him because they desperately want to beat
*  Trump. But now that same fear, he said to me, now meant that they could no longer
*  stand behind Biden, that they worried that he had been diminishing over a period of
*  time and that his staff and the people around him had hidden that from the public.
*  There's a real anger out there among some Democrats.
*  Now, what the Biden circle would tell you is, no, we didn't hide anything from you.
*  Yes, he does have moments where he is not as lucid as you would want him to be.
*  But that broadly speaking, when they see him operate, when they're sitting with him
*  in the Oval Office or the Situation Room, he is sharp.
*  He asks good questions.
*  He understands and grasps the issues that he is confronting.
*  And I mean, we all have good days and bad days.
*  But when you're 81, your good days and bad days may be more pronounced.
*  Right. And if he has good days and bad days, well, Thursday night was a very bad
*  night. Peter, I want to ask you about that, about your view on all of this, because I
*  do think all this has raised this fundamental question for a lot of Democrats, for a
*  lot of journalists, for voters, which is what you're getting at.
*  Was what we saw on the debate stage the real Biden and had the White House been
*  hiding him from us?
*  Or were the people around him just unable to recognize the perils of this
*  themselves? Like, have they been gaslighting us all or are they in denial?
*  Yeah, it's a good question. That's the question in some ways.
*  Right. I think that people who work closely with the president and like him,
*  admire him, respect him, want to see the best in him and want everybody else to
*  see the best in him. And they have been unwilling to admit whether or not he has,
*  you know, slipped in the last three and a half years.
*  And part of it may be strategic.
*  They recognize in their view that he is the president.
*  They've got to build him up and make him as successful as possible.
*  And they have shielded him as much as possible from public scrutiny.
*  He hasn't given as many interviews or as many press conferences as any of his
*  predecessors going back to Reagan.
*  He's never going to interview to the New York Times or the Washington Post or the
*  Wall Street Journal, the L.A.
*  Times or any other newspaper, which is, I think, the first president, certainly in
*  my lifetime, who hasn't done that.
*  And that's been part of a pattern of them trying to protect him.
*  And I think there's kind of a reckoning right now among other Democrats wondering
*  whether they went too far.
*  OK, so we have this huge reaction to this moment, the debate from the Democrats and
*  the news media. Can you walk us through how the Biden team responds to the full
*  blown panic?
*  His campaign was thrown into full blown damage control over the weekend.
*  And the president himself set out to do two things.
*  First, privately, he met with donors and assured them, yes, he's still a viable
*  candidate and that they should still support him.
*  And then publicly, he went on a campaign blitz traveling to seven events in four
*  states. And his first stop on Friday, in fact, was at a rally in Raleigh, North
*  Carolina. This was already scheduled before the debate, but it gave him an
*  opportunity to both show that he can do the job.
*  Thank you, North Carolina.
*  To demonstrate vigor and vitality.
*  I don't know what you did last night, but I spent 90 minutes on the stage and
*  debating the guy who has the morals of an alley cat.
*  And to address his own performance.
*  I know I'm not a young man.
*  State the obvious.
*  Well, I know.
*  And he says pretty candidly, he says, yeah, I'm not a young man.
*  I don't walk as easy as I used to.
*  I don't speak as smoothly as I used to.
*  I don't debate as well as I used to.
*  But he goes on.
*  Well, I know what I do know.
*  I know how to tell the truth.
*  And I had to away from wrong.
*  I know how to do this job.
*  I know how to get things done.
*  I know like millions of Americans know when you get knocked down, you get back up.
*  And, you know, he comes across as pretty vigorous, pretty energetic.
*  Of course, he's reading from a teleprompter.
*  Always a lot easier to read from a teleprompter.
*  But I think more important than that was the body language and the spirit
*  that he brought to the moment.
*  It sounds like teleprompter or not, the Biden who appears at the rally is
*  meaningfully different, at least in style from the president that we saw in the
*  debate stage.
*  I'm wondering if you think this has changed anything.
*  Has the conversation changed?
*  No, not fundamentally.
*  I think fundamentally that people still recognize that there's an issue here.
*  Now, there was pushback among Democrats saying, OK, take a breath.
*  Get a hold of yourself.
*  He's not dropping out.
*  I don't think you judge a person's the body of their work on one night.
*  They don't always go the way you want to.
*  I have confidence in the president because he's delivered.
*  I understand that, you know, he had a rhapsody.
*  But like I told folks, who cares?
*  We have a choice this November between someone that's a good person, a good
*  president with a real record of results and someone that has brought shame on
*  the presidency.
*  Don't let 90 minutes define a career of a president who's been in office for
*  three and a half years, been in politics for 50 years and overshadow the
*  important issues that he stands for.
*  And so you heard that line of thinking in the speech that he made, and he
*  said that line of thinking in the spin room and on TV.
*  Look, I think Joe Biden had a bad debate night, but it doesn't change the fact
*  that Donald Trump was a bad president.
*  And by the way, Trump did terribly, too, which is a fair point.
*  Trump may have been more lucid in the sense that he sounded stronger.
*  But if you actually looked at what he said, listen to what he said, he said so
*  many things were just not true.
*  And it helped Biden that former President Barack Obama put out a statement
*  saying, hey, guys, I've seen bad debates.
*  Don't freak out.
*  In effect is what he said.
*  And Jim Clyburn.
*  And if he asked my opinion, I would give it as I always do.
*  Who is his very close ally in Congress from South Carolina, the congressman who
*  helped get him the nomination in the first place said, stay the course.
*  He should stay in this race.
*  You should demonstrate going forward his capacity to lead the country.
*  So it was important to have those voices out there among prominent Democrats
*  trying to calm the waters.
*  But it only went so far because the waters are still churning underneath.
*  Peter, I'm curious how his donors are reacting to all this.
*  I mean, you mentioned that part of his full court press is to reassure them
*  that he's got the mental acuity to run.
*  How successful has he been at that?
*  Yeah, I think that there's certainly some donors who are resigned.
*  They feel like there's not much choice, but there are others who actually are
*  considering jumping off the boat, jumping on what Mika Brzezinski on Morning
*  Joe called the hysteria train.
*  And I think that it's an open question.
*  But part of the thing is, of course, they're waiting to see how the polls
*  really shake out the initial polls after any debate are often not really
*  representative of how an event settles into the political narrative and the
*  polling and data so far have been kind of contradictory on the one hand, it
*  shows that Trump clearly beat Biden, that Biden clearly lost and that Biden has
*  only reinforced the doubts that most voters had about his age and mental
*  capacity. That's absolutely true.
*  At the same time, there's some polling showing that the overall horse race
*  number, who are you going to vote for hasn't moved dramatically yet, if it does
*  at all. And that, you know, it's possible this is baked in that people who are
*  going to vote against him are still going to vote against him.
*  The people who are going to vote for him, holding the note, may not be happy
*  about it, may still be voting for him.
*  But there's a tell.
*  The tell was from the Biden campaign when they put out a memo by Jen O'Malley
*  Dillon, who's his top political person at the campaign.
*  And she says, if you see polls go down in the next few days or weeks, what's
*  telling is that she is in fact anticipating that polls would be bad for
*  them and trying to set expectations for supporters and voters and donors saying,
*  don't let that panic you any further.
*  That's normal and we'll get past that just as we have other bumps in the road.
*  It seems like the Biden effort over the weekend has in some sense quieted some
*  public doubts from key Democrats, right?
*  There's not a, we didn't see a deluge of senior lawmakers going on Sunday talk
*  shows and saying, Mr.
*  President, step aside.
*  But from what you're saying, and based on the reporting that we've seen from our
*  colleagues, the effort has not by any means ended the discussion about replacing
*  Biden. That is very much still happening under the surface.
*  Yeah.
*  That discussion is very much alive among Democrats.
*  Will Biden and should Biden remain as the candidate?
*  And the question then becomes is, if he doesn't, what then?
*  We'll be right back.
*  Peter, given that this discussion of Biden stepping aside is still, as you
*  said, very much alive, what would it look like for someone to replace him on the
*  presidential ticket at this point in the campaign, just a few months before
*  election day?
*  It sounds like it would be pretty daunting.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, look, we have never had a situation like this, not certainly in modern times.
*  No president has ever dropped out of the race so late in the cycle.
*  First of all, the Democratic National Convention, which would anoint a new
*  nominee is in late August, but they're actually scheduled to take a roll call
*  before the convention begins on August 7th.
*  So that means we have five weeks between now and when the roll call is scheduled
*  to be held to decide a nominee.
*  If the president were to drop out, that would create this truncated, incorrect
*  election.
*  And that would be a very, very difficult situation for the president to take a
*  drop out.
*  That would create this truncated, incredibly intense, incredibly wide open,
*  incredibly volatile short campaign to figure out who would be the nominee.
*  And it's complicated logistically.
*  It's complicated politically.
*  It's complicated in all sorts of ways.
*  And we don't really know what's going to happen or how it would happen because
*  we've never seen it before.
*  But it is conceivable.
*  It is possible.
*  The president has to decide that he's not going to run.
*  If that doesn't happen, then there's no contest.
*  There's no way anybody sees a forcing him off the ballot if he chooses to
*  continue to run.
*  There doesn't seem to be any appetite for trying to find a way to undo his
*  nomination other than with his consent.
*  He controls the 3,900 delegates that are going to be at the convention.
*  They're obligated to vote for him on the first ballot.
*  So it has to be first his decision on whether he continues to run.
*  If he does, then that's it.
*  That's the end of that question.
*  But if he doesn't, then it's jump ball.
*  Would his replacement automatically be Kamala Harris as the vice president?
*  No, not at all.
*  If they were after the convention and they were both nominated and then he
*  stepped aside the last minute, then they probably would simply go to Kamala
*  Harris because she had been ratified by the convention as the vice presidential
*  candidate. That's possible.
*  But if we're talking about a situation before the convention, it's anybody's
*  guess. There's about a dozen other prominent Democrats out there who
*  are looking at jumping in if suddenly the nomination is up for grabs.
*  But so who are we talking about?
*  What are some of the most prominent names that have come up?
*  Well, other than Kamala Harris, you have a number of governors, particularly
*  Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Jamie Pritzker of
*  Illinois. There are, of course, those who ran last time who might jump back in
*  in theory. Senator Cory Booker, Senator Amy Klobuchar, potentially even maybe
*  Pete Buttigieg, who is currently the transportation secretary.
*  But the ones who are going to have the best chance are those who have an
*  apparatus already, who have a set of donors and fundraisers who can raise money
*  instantly and who have the ability to get on TV and get media attention without
*  having to work as hard for it. And that does suggest obviously a sitting vice
*  president or a sitting governor.
*  Basically, hitting reset on the whole nomination process requires embracing a
*  moment of genuine political chaos.
*  I mean, that's the theoretical downside of this.
*  But of course, I mean, there's also a potential upside, right?
*  Massive media attention potentially for whoever the replacement Democrat is, the
*  possibility that that replacement could energize a lot of Democratic voters and
*  independents and even potentially moderate Republicans out there who dislike
*  Trump but just couldn't get excited about Biden.
*  Yeah, absolutely. Whoever emerges will have a certain advantage of freshness,
*  right? And that person will have a generational argument to make against
*  Trump because whoever it would be would be younger than Trump.
*  And suddenly Trump is then the old candidate.
*  He's 78. And that new Democratic candidate will be able to say, I'm the next
*  generation. This guy is also too old to be president.
*  And if your concern about our guy was can he make it through four years, then
*  you should be picking me because the other guy can't make it either through four
*  years. Now, the downside, of course, is these are people who are largely untested
*  on a national stage, at least in this kind of an environment.
*  And you don't know how people will do once they actually jump in.
*  They didn't have the advantage of a yearlong primary contest to prove themselves.
*  Before you jump into a race, you can look really attractive.
*  Look at Ron DeSantis before he jumped in to the Republican primaries on the
*  Republican side. They all thought, wow, he's really great.
*  Didn't turn out to be so great once he got on the campaign trail.
*  The magic didn't actually appear.
*  So that's the danger here is we don't know which of these Democrats, if any,
*  would have the ability to shine when the big giant Klingonites are on them.
*  And we're clearly in a delicate moment right now.
*  But are any of these potential contenders trying to signal interest at this point?
*  I mean, what does that look like?
*  It sort of seems like the art of raising your hand for something, but not wanting
*  it too publicly.
*  Yeah, it's a really good question because you obviously can't do anything that seems
*  disloyal to Biden, right?
*  Nobody's willing to take on Biden directly and say, I'm now running and you should take
*  him down. So the trick here is you have to be loyal, loyal, loyal right up to the
*  minute that Biden says he's not running, at which point then suddenly you're off
*  for the races. And doing that from a standing start is not a good idea for any
*  campaign. So they have to find ways of talking to their people, lining up donors,
*  thinking about what kind of a campaign would look like, who might be their
*  strategist without letting anybody know that they're doing that, at least not
*  let anybody in our business know that because it would obviously backlash on
*  them. And that's a very hard thing to do.
*  I mean, I've heard that there are people out there making phone calls who want to
*  run, but nobody's going to admit that outright because it would be damaging to
*  them.
*  And in terms of logistics here, I know this is all very hypothetical, but if a
*  new candidate were to become the nominee, do they get all the money Biden raised?
*  Do they get his campaign team or are they literally creating a presidential campaign
*  from scratch with four months to go?
*  I mean, presumably they would adopt a lot of Biden's apparatus.
*  As for the money, a lot of the money these days is in kind of super PACs and the sort
*  of amorphous structures that can go immediately to a different candidate.
*  And everybody who contributed to Biden can now contribute to the new candidate.
*  And then Biden can still spend his money as he chooses in support of whoever the
*  candidate is. So there's that advantage in a way it could actually increase some
*  fundraising. But you're right, they would be starting from scratch in a lot of ways,
*  at least in terms of a national organization.
*  And obviously, for this to even happen, it relies on Biden stepping aside here, as
*  you said, everything you've laid out so far suggests that he is for now at least
*  closed off to this suggestion.
*  And I have to ask what you think from your reporting would change that.
*  Well, President Biden is a proud man.
*  He's a stubborn man, as a lot of people of any age are.
*  He is reluctant to confront and face his own weaknesses.
*  And he's not going to be talked out of running by a bunch of media, chattering
*  class pundits and junior Democrats.
*  I mean, think about he's been running for president since 1987.
*  And the idea that he is now in office and running the country and as he thinks it,
*  running it pretty well, that he's going to simply step aside because a bunch of
*  people tell him he should. He reacts viscerally to that.
*  Of course, he doesn't want to do that.
*  In fact, when you talk to Democrats, they're very conscious of not trying to push
*  him because it could have the opposite reaction, right?
*  It could trigger him to want to stay even more.
*  The people who have influence with him, not that many people.
*  I mean, at this point, he's been in politics since 1972 when he was elected to
*  the Senate and the people he considers his peers, most of them are gone.
*  Right.
*  He's not surrounded by people whose opinion he truly respects.
*  Obama and Clinton, the only two former presidents out there, other than Jimmy
*  Carter, who are Democrats.
*  I don't know that if they told him it was time to pull the plug that he would
*  listen to that. In fact, he might again do the opposite.
*  He still resents Obama for discouraging from running in 2016.
*  Obviously, congressional leaders like Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Hakeem
*  Jeffries, Jim Clyburn, people like that could have an influence if they were to
*  go as a group to him in the way like the Republicans went to Nixon in 1974 and
*  said that he wasn't going to survive.
*  Maybe that might influence him, but I don't think they're likely to do it.
*  It doesn't look like they're likely to do that.
*  Who does have a zero?
*  I mean, who does he really listen to?
*  Who do we know he's going to be listening to in this moment?
*  Well, the real people he listens to the most are his family.
*  The very family oriented guy.
*  Remember, he went home to Wilmington almost every night when he was a senator.
*  Even now, as president, he flies home to Wilmington most every weekend.
*  And he's at Camp David this weekend with his family.
*  They're there because they had already planned to be together for a photo shoot,
*  ironically, with Annie Leibovitz.
*  So the family was already gathering at Camp David, which gives him an opportunity.
*  Right. It gives him an opportunity to have a heart to heart conversation
*  with the people who mean the most to him, in particular, Jill Biden, of course,
*  the first lady, his sister, Valerie, the kids and the grandkids.
*  We don't know what that conversation looks like.
*  I mean, that's that's as private as it comes someday.
*  There'll be histories written and memoirs written.
*  And I'm fascinated to to read what's happening this weekend at Camp David,
*  because I think it's kind of pivotal.
*  But what we do know is that up until now, at least Jill has been all in.
*  She's been encouraging to run and it sounds like she's been encouraging to stay in.
*  And a lot of people think her voice is the most important voice in this.
*  And just to pause on this for a second, Peter,
*  it sounds like you're saying something pretty remarkable, actually,
*  which is that this very small handful of people have influence over
*  what is going to be a massive decision that affects hundreds of millions of Americans
*  and and really the entire world.
*  Well, don't underplay it.
*  But yeah, that's exactly right.
*  And you're right to point out the stakes here,
*  because it's not just about Joe Biden and his future.
*  It is about this presidential race and is about whether you want Donald Trump back in office.
*  That's the way most Democrats look at it.
*  And the difference between a Biden presidency and a Trump presidency
*  is about as stark as you can imagine.
*  And this will have consequences that will ripple out for years to come.
*  Peter, I kind of want to end where we began this conversation,
*  which is with this question of Democrats mindset right now post debate.
*  And the question of what's motivating them in this moment.
*  Privately, they're talking about replacing Biden.
*  They seem too scared to do that publicly for all the reasons we've discussed,
*  including that the White House is basically telling them to stop talking about it
*  and that Biden probably won't step aside anyway.
*  So all of this may just be useless hand wringing.
*  And all of that raises a pretty essential question for me, which is,
*  are Democrats about to recommit to a damaged nominee
*  who had a disastrous debate, who may only get worse over time
*  out of loyalty to President Biden?
*  Or do you think on some level they really believe this is all just overblown,
*  that it's one debate, everybody has bad days and Biden really can recover from all this?
*  I think there's a lot of doubt in the party that he can really recover from this.
*  It is the argument, obviously, the Biden campaign is making.
*  And it's really the only argument they have available to them to say, look,
*  don't overreact here.
*  It's just the media hyperventilating.
*  We will recover like we've recovered before.
*  And it is what they have to say because they don't have anything else
*  that they can say.
*  But almost every Democrat outside of the inner circle that I talk to
*  says this was a complete disaster.
*  They are not sugarcoating it.
*  They saw what they saw with their own eyes.
*  And they think that it's not tenable for the campaign to pretend otherwise.
*  And it's particularly devastating because the weakness of the Biden campaign
*  has always been concerns about his age.
*  People have expressed that to pollsters and in interviews with reporters
*  going back more than a year.
*  And now they just saw it for themselves on TV, in their living rooms,
*  more than 50 million of them.
*  And to convince them not to believe what they saw with their own eyes
*  is just a monumental task politically.
*  So for Biden's team and for the Democrats,
*  it's a big roll of the dice.
*  Do you stick with him and try to correct the damage in the four months you have?
*  Or do you say it's time for somebody else,
*  which is going to be a roll of the dice itself?
*  And assuming Biden continues, Peter,
*  it sounds like we won't know if that bet, that bet that, you know,
*  he's the only one that ever beat him.
*  He's the only guy that can get this done.
*  If that was solid or diluted thinking until November 5th.
*  On November 5th or whatever day the election is resolved,
*  we will know how history judges us.
*  And maybe everybody looks back on this and says, well, that was close.
*  But, you know, they were right to stick it out, you know, because they won.
*  Or in fact, it was a disastrous decision and they wasted an opportunity to fix
*  a campaign that was already having trouble.
*  Hindsight will be perfect.
*  But there's no question that this weekend will be remembered as perhaps
*  the most decisive of this campaign.
*  Peter, thanks for coming on.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  After we spoke with Peter, the New York Times
*  reported that while at Camp David, Biden's family urged the president
*  to stay in the race, arguing that, yes, he could still show voters
*  he's capable of serving another four years.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Early projections show that France's far right National Rally Party
*  won a decisive victory in the first round of voting for the country's
*  National Assembly on Sunday.
*  National Rally, an anti-immigrant party long on the fringes of the French
*  political scene, captured about a third of the vote, according to polls,
*  and now appears poised to become the largest force in the lower house of
*  parliament. The results dealt a blow to French parliament, but the
*  French president Emmanuel Macron, who took a gamble by dissolving
*  parliament last month and calling for snap elections, but his bet that
*  the far right wouldn't repeat its recent success in European parliament
*  elections, backfired.
*  A runoff election between the leading parties will be held on July 7th.
