# France’s Horrifying Rape Trial Has a Feminist Hero
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH_zvbNOStI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  As soon as this week, after months of testimony, verdicts are expected in a rape trial that
*  has both horrified and captivated the people of France.
*  Today, my colleague, correspondent Catherine Porter, on the woman at the center of that
*  trial and how, with a single decision, she has turned the power dynamics of the MeToo
*  era on their head.
*  It's Wednesday, December 18th.
*  Catherine, it has been a really long time, and I am very glad to be speaking with you.
*  Me too.
*  It's nice to be back with you, Michael.
*  So we're going to be talking today about a case that, when it first began to reverberate
*  outside of France, where you are, really shocked the world.
*  And then, as even the most shocking things do, it kind of receded from our collective
*  consciousness, but not from yours.
*  No, oh my God.
*  And I think it hasn't receded from the French consciousness either, because once you put
*  your mind to it and you lock your eyes on it, it's really hard to tear them away.
*  This is a story of a rape trial in which 51 men are on trial at the same time for raping
*  or sexually assaulting the same woman.
*  So I think that even if you just hear that much, it's so much to handle, but there's
*  all these other elements that have made this case impossible to look away from.
*  And the most important one is the woman at the center and the way she has conducted herself
*  throughout this trial and her decision really to use her own private torment and hell as
*  a force for greater good to change society.
*  Well, to understand how the woman at the center of this case does this remarkable thing, let's
*  start at the beginning of this case.
*  Sure.
*  So this case begins in the end of 2020 and it involves a married couple living in the
*  south of France, Giselle Pelico and her husband Dominique.
*  They had been married for about 50 years and had retired from the Paris region and moved
*  down to this small, idyllic town.
*  And in many ways, they lived a very idyllic life.
*  He was going for long bike rides.
*  She had become a big walker.
*  They had three children who they're very close to and seven grandchildren who would come
*  down for long weekends.
*  And by all accounts, they were very happy, except for she was suffering some weird medical
*  problems.
*  Her hair was falling out.
*  She had lost quite a bit of weight, but most notably she had these increasing blackouts
*  and he was driving her to different medical appointments to try and figure out what was
*  going wrong.
*  And then one day in September, things began to really change.
*  Her husband, Dominique, is caught by security guards filming up the skirts of women in a
*  nearby grocery store and they call the police.
*  The police come and they take not only his two cell phones and cameras he's using, but
*  they go back to his house and get his laptop and some other electronics.
*  And they discovered something pretty shocking on them.
*  They found these pictures and videos of a woman who seemed to be unconscious being raped
*  and some screen captures of conversations about raping her.
*  So there is something very dark happening just under the surface of what looks like
*  this very idyllic life.
*  Yeah, that is right.
*  When all this is happening, Gisele is in Paris helping take care of some of her grandkids.
*  So she only learns about it from her husband when she gets back and he only tells her about
*  the arrest of the store, not anything that the police have found on his electronics because
*  he hasn't been confronted by that either.
*  He says he was caught filming up the skirts of women and he's in tears.
*  He apologizes and she says her reaction is, I will stay with you because I've always stood
*  beside you and I will forgive you.
*  And their life kind of returns to what it was beforehand.
*  And then in November, the cops call her and say, do you know what your husband's been
*  charged for?
*  And she says, yes, I do.
*  I'm a little worried about it, but we're talking about it and we're going to work on it together.
*  And they say, well, we'd like you to come down when he comes down for his next meeting
*  at the police station.
*  So that morning they get up, they have breakfast, she says, totally normal conversation.
*  They get in the car, they drive to the police station.
*  He goes in to meet with some police officers and she goes in to meet with others and they
*  unload a bombshell to tell her that the life as she has known it is nothing, nothing like
*  what she thinks it is.
*  What exactly do they tell her?
*  They tell her that these videos they've been looking at on her husband's electronics are
*  of an unconscious woman being raped by him and they believe it's her.
*  And they believe not only that her husband has been drugging her in order to rape her,
*  but he has been inviting strangers into their home to join him in raping her.
*  An unfathomable piece of information to absorb, I have to imagine, because in this moment
*  she is hearing that her whole life is not what she thought it was and that the man she's
*  married to is a monster.
*  Not only married to, she's been with him since they were teenagers.
*  She's built her entire life around this man.
*  She has said that she contemplated committing suicide that night.
*  Wow.
*  Because it would just be almost impossible to conceive of or to accept that the person
*  that is your person has been so terribly betraying you.
*  And just to be very clear, because it almost seems impossible to wrap one's head around
*  this, she, if I'm intuiting from you correctly, has no inkling of any of this.
*  No, and it's even worse than that, Michael.
*  Remember I told you about those horrible symptoms she had been suffering?
*  The hair loss, the weight loss, but most worrying, the blackouts?
*  Well, in the end, he was driving her to all these medical appointments and it was the
*  drugs he was mixing into her food and drink that were causing those symptoms in the first
*  place.
*  Wow.
*  And in the meantime, the police are continuing their investigation.
*  They find this hard drive in the couple's garage and on the hard drive, they find about
*  20,000 photos and videos, most of them filed in a folder that Mr. Pellicoe had labeled
*  abuse.
*  And these are videos and photos of the rape scenes in that bedroom at night when he's
*  inviting men over.
*  He's cut into a separate little either video or a photo to keep for himself.
*  And through these 20,000 little data points, plus using his Skype conversations, they start
*  tracking down these men and start arresting them in waves over many months.
*  And what do we learn about these men accused of this unbelievably horrible act?
*  Well, in the French press, they started calling them Monsieur Tout Le Monde, Mr. Everyman,
*  because really when you look at them, the guys who have been charged range in age from
*  late 20s to in their 70s, their grandfathers.
*  Many of them are fathers themselves.
*  They kind of span all the range of middle class or working class men in small town France.
*  They're truck drivers or carpenters.
*  One of them is an IT specialist in a bank and another is a journalist.
*  A number of them have history of drug or alcohol abuse, and some of them have their own history
*  of sexual assault in their own lives as children.
*  But the thing that's the most remarkable about them is that they just seem like, you know,
*  your next door neighbor.
*  They could be your next door neighbor.
*  And in the end, that's what really shocked a lot of French people is that they were their
*  next door neighbors.
*  It feels like this is normally the stage in a story like this, as we know from countless
*  Me Too episodes of this show that we have made, where despite even the unique horrors
*  of what you're describing here, the legal system kicks in in this kind of predictable way.
*  And the media world starts to pay attention in a way that focuses very heavily on the
*  perpetrators, on the men.
*  And the victim, the woman here, quite understandably remains anonymous.
*  Right, because most victims are offered the right to have a closed trial and most of them
*  take it.
*  I've covered a lot of rape trials in my career and almost never named the victim in them.
*  I can think of only one other time because most rape victims don't want their names out
*  there because there's a lot of shame around rape, even though it's completely undeserved.
*  And there shouldn't be shame, but people feel culpable in some way.
*  And so I fully expected her as a grandmother, as someone who was not a feminist activist
*  before, to take the regular path of deciding to have her case be private.
*  So I wrote the first story and I was very careful.
*  We didn't want to identify her.
*  So she had moved out of the town and she had changed her last name to her maiden name.
*  So we could use her name as Giselle and that's it.
*  And then her lawyer said to me that she seemed pretty sure she was going to go public.
*  And I thought, you know, I just didn't believe it because I thought there's no way that the
*  71 year old grandmother would, once she got into court, decide to use her full name and
*  the face of such a traumatic series of rapes.
*  But in the end, she decided in a very poignant statement that she wanted shame to change
*  sides.
*  She thinks there's no place for shame on the side of the victim.
*  It should be placed on the side of the accused.
*  And she makes this really brave and unusual decision to open her trial to the public and
*  use her married name.
*  In other words, to use her husband's name.
*  Right.
*  So she decides on the day that the trial opens that she will be known publicly as Giselle
*  Pellico.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Catherine, take us inside the courtroom into this trial and walk us through how this
*  remarkable decision ends up influencing how the case plays out.
*  Well, it meant that I could be in the courtroom together with many other journalists.
*  I'm inside the courthouse now.
*  It's a big room.
*  There's a raised bench behind which five judges and two prosecutors sit.
*  And then the very wide box that was built especially for this trial into the room.
*  The courtroom was nothing like a courtroom I've ever reported in.
*  It had been retrofitted for all of these accused.
*  The defendants are starting to come in.
*  Many have had sunglasses and surgical masks on to try and protect their identities.
*  And what's really noticeable is they appear to be a full range of ages, styles, looks.
*  Some are very skinny and gaunt.
*  The other has, I'm looking at, has quite a big paunch.
*  It's a full spectrum.
*  And you really get that sense sitting here where I'm looking around.
*  It's like being in a bus.
*  All sorts of people.
*  They're sitting all around me as a journalist in the back of the room, but also right up
*  against Madame Pellicoe, who's sitting against one wall behind her two lawyers.
*  And in front of her and all around her are the accused men who are charged with raping her.
*  From what you're saying, the scale, the enormity of the alleged crime here is just physically
*  inescapable in the room.
*  The enormity of the crime, the number of men, but also what I was saying before, just the
*  fact that you really sort of physically and literally can see this idea of Mr. Everyman.
*  And at the center of it all, quite literally, the scene is Giselle Pellicoe.
*  Yeah.
*  Madame Pellicoe comes in that first day with her two lawyers and her three children trailing
*  behind her.
*  And she literally embodies this idea of not being ashamed.
*  She's so dignified.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, you know, just imagine this would be a moment of great nervousness, of fury, of
*  anger, of probably emotional crisis.
*  And yet from the first moment, Madame Pellicoe has been literally the picture of poise and
*  grace and calm.
*  She's like a classic Parisian grandmother.
*  Her clothing is perfectly appointed, not too beautiful, but also just neat and tidy.
*  Her hair, she's got a nice bob.
*  Her head is held high.
*  And when she took the stand the first day, she described how her life had fallen apart
*  that morning when she stepped into the police station and how she is making this decision
*  that she wanted France to look at rape straight.
*  And she thought that this was the time for the country to have a big conversation around
*  what it means to be raped and how prevalent it is.
*  She says this out loud, which sounds a bit to me like the words of a civil rights figure,
*  not a French grandmother.
*  Yeah, she says this out loud.
*  And not only does she say this, she and her lawyers fight to have these videos play in
*  court in the public.
*  Videos of her sexual assault.
*  Videos of her sexual assaults, many of them, because many of the men are denying that this
*  was rape.
*  They're basically saying they believed that she had consented to this and that they hadn't
*  intended to rape her.
*  And here they have, unlike most rape victims, they have evidence of what had exactly happened
*  in that room.
*  They have videos.
*  So after lifting the veil of anonymity that so often surrounds the victim, she's now making
*  sure that there is no anonymity whatsoever around the conduct of the accused men.
*  She's making sure that every graphic, horrific detail of this case is aired publicly.
*  And you know, when they are played in court, this real awkward silence descends.
*  And after a few minutes, many journalists stop looking at the screens because it's so
*  uncomfortable.
*  Her snores are filling the courtroom.
*  The evidence of her unconsciousness.
*  She is, I mean, one of the doctors in the case described her as a corpse.
*  And she sits there throughout.
*  I have never seen her leave the courtroom while one of those videos is playing.
*  It's hard for me, Catherine, to fathom what kind of a defense can be put forward by the
*  dozens of men, many of them in this courtroom, knowing what's on those videos, these audible
*  sounds of her being asleep.
*  So what are they saying or do we expect them to say in this trial in their own defense,
*  if anything?
*  Right.
*  I mean, most cases of rape are he said, she said.
*  But here is there the library of proof.
*  And yet most of the men say what almost every man says in defense when it comes to rape,
*  that they thought she was consenting.
*  Most of them say that they had not come to rape her, but that Mr. Pellicoe had invited
*  them over for a threesome and had either explained to them that she was pretending to sleep and
*  it was part of their fantasy that she be woken up by this stranger together with her husband.
*  Or some say that they were told that she had taken a few sleeping pills just as they got
*  there to help her relax because she was shy.
*  And a few by the end were saying that they believe that Mr. Pellicoe had also drugged
*  them.
*  That even though in the videos they seemed totally normal and weren't sleeping, were
*  very active, that they have no memory of what happened in there.
*  And they believe that somehow he had slipped something into a glass of water and had drugged
*  them.
*  And since we're talking about the defense of these men, what has her ex-husband said
*  in his defense?
*  He has pled guilty.
*  He has said that he was traumatized as a child and that he had these impulses that just got
*  stronger and stronger and he couldn't help himself and that his wife did not deserve
*  this and that he loved her despite all the evidence to the contrary.
*  So he is in no way denying that the worst conceivable version of this is exactly what
*  happened.
*  Right.
*  He is in fact saying that these men who say they were tricked or they didn't understand
*  that she was drugged, that they're all lying.
*  That he says, clearly I am a rapist and all of these men in the room are rapists just
*  like me.
*  You had said that Giselle Pellicoe wanted to change society with this approach to the
*  herself be named by opening it up to reporters like you.
*  So the question is, has she accomplished that?
*  And if she has, how exactly?
*  Well let me tell you what I've experienced going to the courtroom.
*  The first few days there were just a few reporters and then by I would say the second week there
*  were not just many more reporters.
*  There were crowds and crowds of mostly women coming to get a seat in this courthouse to
*  watch her.
*  Wow.
*  I'm standing outside the courtroom and people are leaving and there's a walkway that has
*  formed of spectators, mostly women outside the...
*  Oh and they are applauding Madame Pellicoe.
*  And when she would leave the courtroom at the end of every day, they started to form
*  an honor line and line her route to applaud her and cheer her.
*  And that crowd has not subsided.
*  You know, I met a bunch of feminists that are part of a small feminist organization
*  in Avignon in the courthouse.
*  They've been going regularly to watch the trial and at night they have been taking what
*  they've heard inside the courtroom and pasting it on the walls of Avignon in a way to kind
*  of shock the city I think and shock the country to listen to what these men were saying in
*  the rooms.
*  So some of them that I passed on the streets on the way to the courthouse were like, it
*  was an involuntary rape or it was an accidental rape or one that really stopped me was I raped
*  her with my body but not with my mind.
*  It feels like if this scene outside the courtroom is any indication that what Giselle Pellicoe
*  wants to happen around shame and rape culture, it's actually already starting to happen.
*  She is effectuating this change herself.
*  Yeah, the response has been enormous.
*  Giselle Pellicoe, she accepts this?
*  People are talking about this around the dining room table, on the radio, in the newspapers.
*  The stories in the newspapers have just been erupting.
*  It's a culture, it's a system, it's a structure.
*  Men are talking about toxic masculinity and needing to change it.
*  There's a big crazy thing about the notion of consent.
*  Men have been talking about consent and teaching consent in the classrooms because that's something
*  that has not been happening in France.
*  She's really launched this very large, profound conversation and you can feel it reverberating
*  out across the country.
*  It strikes me that the unintended consequence of these long-time practices that we use when
*  it comes to rape, of shrouding a victim in anonymity, which makes so much sense for so
*  many reasons because of the shame you described, that they've had this unintentional consequence
*  that we haven't really thought that much about, which is we end up focused so little on the
*  women who have had this experience because they mostly remain anonymous.
*  We end up spending so much of our time focused on the men.
*  What's changed here is that Giselle Pellicoe has said not just that she's going to switch
*  up the question of shame, but she's going to switch up the question of basic power.
*  It's amazing to watch her in those videos because she's so objectified.
*  She is not a human being.
*  She is a sex doll, basically.
*  She's so objectified and become a fully formed, very powerful person.
*  Something else, Michael, that really resonated with me is that one of her lawyers said, in
*  most cases, trials when you keep it private is just you, the victim, facing the accuser
*  alone in a room.
*  Giselle Pellicoe invited all of France into that room with her.
*  All the world, all of us.
*  I think she's felt incredible support because of that.
*  The last day of the court before the final statements, the judges asked her if she had
*  anything else she wanted to say.
*  She got back up and she said, at the beginning of the trial, her family felt ashamed of the
*  name Pellicoe.
*  She felt that over the past four months, she was sure that the name Dominique Pellicoe
*  would be long forgotten.
*  The name that people remember from this court case would be hers, Giselle Pellicoe, and
*  that already her grandchildren are proud to have that name.
*  Well, Catherine, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Ukraine says it has assassinated the general who led Russia's nuclear defense force.
*  The general, Igor Kugelov, was killed when an explosive device planted inside a scooter
*  was detonated on Tuesday morning near the entryway to a residential building.
*  It was one of Ukraine's most brazen assassinations since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three
*  years ago.
*  And...
*  This was a frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and
*  attention and intimidation.
*  On Tuesday, New York City prosecutors charged Luigi Mangione with first-degree murder in
*  the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.
*  The charges branded Mangione a terrorist and portrayed his alleged murder plot as a political
*  act.
