# How NAFTA Broke American Politics
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKNeqKlhLY0)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Balbaro. This is The Daily.
*  A very, very big hello to Wisconsin.
*  Oh, it's good to be back in Michigan.
*  On the campaign trail, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are constantly talking about trade,
*  tariffs and domestic manufacturing.
*  Now people are moving their companies to other countries and we're getting killed, by the
*  way, by Mexico.
*  We announced the opening of more than 20 new auto plants in the United States.
*  We'll put a tariff of 200 percent on if we have to.
*  We're not letting those cars come into the United States.
*  And we will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs are not only invented, but
*  built right here in America by American union workers.
*  That's because, in many ways, the United States is still reeling from a single trade deal
*  that transformed the U.S. economy and remade both parties' relationship to the working class.
*  Today, Times Magazine writer Dan Kaufman with the story of how the North American Free Trade
*  Agreement broke American politics.
*  It's Tuesday, October 8th.
*  Dan, it's a pretty rare thing when we can trace the origins of our politics back to
*  something really concrete and specific, not a set of vast and tangible forces, but a moment
*  in time when a group of people got together and made a decision.
*  And you contend that to understand our politics today, specifically to understand this presidential
*  campaign, you can go back to one such decision made in the 1990s around U.S. trade policy.
*  So just explain that and justify it.
*  Sure.
*  Well, in 1993, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA.
*  It was signed into law by Bill Clinton.
*  What it did was it opened up trade with Mexico and Canada.
*  And I think it was one of the most pivotal political moments.
*  It signaled the outsourcing of good paying manufacturing jobs, particularly in the Rust
*  Belt states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio.
*  But it also signaled something much more long term and transformative.
*  And I think that is a political shift with the Democratic Party moving away from its
*  working class New Deal roots towards the professional class and the college educated and wealthier,
*  a lot of people on Wall Street.
*  And the Republican Party, which had traditionally been the party of big business, at least rhetorically
*  embracing a working class politics, whether or not they fulfilled any of those promises
*  is another question.
*  But the rhetoric changed markedly.
*  Hmm.
*  In other words, NAFTA is a moment where our basic understandings and assumptions about
*  how the two parties relate to this really huge and always symbolically significant segment
*  of the population, the working class, the people who work in factories, people who make
*  things.
*  It changes and it kind of shatters.
*  That's right.
*  It realigned the parties.
*  And I think those dynamics are still playing out today.
*  So Dan, take us back to the time and the place and the debate that brought us NAFTA.
*  And I should say I vaguely remember it because I think it was pretty much the first big public
*  policy debate that occurred in my young adulthood.
*  CNN was kind of a mainstay in my childhood living room.
*  And I can remember some of this, but very vaguely.
*  So plunge us back into it.
*  Sure.
*  Well, the debate over NAFTA emerged at a kind of interesting, difficult moment in the 1970s.
*  There was a period of high inflation and then high interest rates.
*  And this eventually led to two recessions.
*  That is the context in which Ronald Reagan first floats in 1979, this idea of a North
*  American free trade agreement.
*  And what was the logic of it?
*  He was really influenced by Milton Friedman, a libertarian economist.
*  They believed that free trade was a win-win situation, that it would increase our exports,
*  which would create all these jobs and take away government regulation.
*  And they were deeply opposed to that.
*  And Reagan actually managed to take a step towards NAFTA.
*  He had made an agreement with Canada that allowed for goods to be exported without tariffs
*  or duties and goods to be imported without tariffs or duties.
*  Thus free trade.
*  Thus it was called free trade.
*  But the US and Canada had similarly developed economies.
*  They paid about the same level in wages.
*  The difference with NAFTA was now you were creating a similar agreement with Mexico,
*  with a country that was quite impoverished.
*  And the critics immediately feared that it was merely a pretext to allow corporations
*  to exploit cheap labor.
*  In other words, they could avoid paying union wages by moving plants to Mexico.
*  American workers were paid far less than a unionized Canadian or American worker.
*  So in this moment, there's really a philosophical debate occurring.
*  Will this trade agreement help the US economy or will it hurt it?
*  And the Republicans, from what you're saying, are coming down strongly on the side of this
*  being good for the US economy and good for the United States in general.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And it was really George H.W. Bush who pursued NAFTA and actually negotiated the agreement
*  with his counterparts, the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of Mexico.
*  However, it still needed to be ratified by Congress and then signed into law by the president.
*  So NAFTA becomes the centerpiece of the 1992 presidential campaign.
*  Good evening and welcome to the second of three presidential debates between the major
*  candidates for president of the United States.
*  There were three candidates, George H.W. Bush, the Republican incumbent versus Democratic
*  nominee Bill Clinton, and then a really interesting third party candidate named Ross Perot, who
*  was a wealthy businessman.
*  So President Bush, I think you said it earlier, let's get it on.
*  Let's go.
*  George H.W. Bush took the position that the agreement should just be signed.
*  The thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports.
*  And what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.
*  It would lead to an export boom and a great flourishing of American jobs.
*  And I want to have more of these free trade agreements.
*  Ross Perot was the most critical.
*  The most important issue for him was opposition to NAFTA, and he articulated that position.
*  You're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south
*  of the border, pay a dollar an hour for your labor, have no health care, have no environmental
*  controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement.
*  And you don't care about anything but making money.
*  He issued one of the most memorable lines about NAFTA.
*  There will be a giant sucking sound going south.
*  He said that there would be a giant sucking sound of American jobs if NAFTA was passed.
*  I'd like to answer the question because I've actually been a governor for 12 years.
*  Bill Clinton did something very striking.
*  He took a middle position.
*  So I've known a lot of people who've lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas.
*  And I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports.
*  In which he supported the agreement.
*  The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.
*  But he wanted separate side agreements to protect environmental regulations and labor.
*  So more trade, but on fair terms, in favor investment in America.
*  Thank you.
*  I think we have a question over here.
*  So Bush, the Republican in the race, he's pretty much saying, do this deal.
*  Don't worry about it.
*  It's going to work out.
*  Perot, the independent, is saying, don't do this deal.
*  This is a terrible idea.
*  It's going to hurt American manufacturing.
*  Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and as we know, future president, he's trying to straddle
*  those two.
*  And I want to linger on Clinton.
*  Why do you think Clinton took that middle approach?
*  Given that the Democratic party had been the party of organized labor and had relied on
*  manufacturing workers and their unions as such a core constituency in elections.
*  Right.
*  The Democrats had been out of power for 12 years by that point.
*  There was a tremendous desire to reclaim the presidency.
*  Bill Clinton was also part of what they called the New Democrats, which had emerged in the
*  80s.
*  And it was trying to reorient the party to be more business friendly, corporate friendly,
*  and remove its image as a party that was supportive of the activist government of the New Deal,
*  that it had become modernized.
*  NAFTA was seen as the future.
*  Organized labor was deeply opposed throughout.
*  And the reason he tried to find this middle position was to allay their fears and to thread
*  this needle.
*  And for the purposes of this election, he did thread the needle.
*  He won.
*  However, it's also worth noting that Ross Perot won 19% of the vote.
*  That was the highest share since 1912.
*  For a third party candidate.
*  Right.
*  Bill Clinton is now the president of the United States, first Democrat in 12 years, and he
*  begins selling NAFTA.
*  I have lived with the manufacturing changes of the last 15 years.
*  And I would never knowingly do anything that would cost Americans jobs.
*  Mainly to the Democratic Party.
*  He needed a significant faction of them in order to pass it.
*  So he pushed very, very hard.
*  But I'm telling you, nothing I do as your president within the borders of the United
*  States can create more jobs and higher incomes unless somebody buys the stuff we produce.
*  He thought more exports would help create more American jobs, offsetting whatever loss
*  of jobs we would have.
*  I mean, this is a, the world is changing.
*  So as cruel or tough as it is, we can't pretend that it's not going to happen.
*  You know, there was also an undercurrent of inevitability.
*  was here, whether we like it or not.
*  And we had to tame it to our benefit.
*  So I ask you to talk to your friends and neighbors.
*  Talk to the people who are worried about it.
*  Tell them their fears are well founded, but they don't have anything to do with this agreement.
*  This agreement will make it better.
*  The other thing he does is he dispatches Al Gore, his vice president.
*  Welcome to a special edition of Larry King Live.
*  And Gore winds up sitting across from Ross Perot on Larry King Live.
*  This is a huge, huge national event.
*  And they debate NAFTA.
*  When I'm in a room with corporate America, the first thing they say is, Perot, why don't
*  you keep your mouth shut?
*  Perot is saying his corporate CEO friends are telling him, please shut up.
*  This is a great deal for us.
*  Meanwhile, Gore is relying heavily on this technocratic expertise.
*  Every living former president of the United States in both parties, every former secretary
*  of state, every former secretary of treasury, every living Nobel Prize winner in economics,
*  conservatives, liberals, everyone in between, they've never agreed on anything.
*  He is basically saying this is an empirical fact.
*  There have been 23 studies of the impact of NAFTA on jobs in the United States.
*  22 of them have shown that it will cause an increase in jobs in the United States.
*  It's what the experts say is the best thing.
*  He's saying trust the smartest people in the country.
*  Trust the smartest people.
*  And that is also really interesting in terms of the Democratic Party's realignment away
*  from working class, labor oriented party towards someone that is really concerned with technocratic
*  advice.
*  And there's another professional class constituency that's deeply in favor.
*  That is the media, including the New York Times.
*  Our editorial board, we should probably say.
*  Our editorial board.
*  A lot of the media were now college educated folks and they were distant from these working
*  class places.
*  Organized labor, the people that were fighting NAFTA were seen as yesterday's news.
*  They were fighting a losing battle.
*  NAFTA was the future.
*  It was irreversible.
*  There was a lot of triumphalism around this time.
*  It feels like what you're describing is something of an echo chamber where these Democratic
*  leaders in the Clinton administration are talking about how every expert thinks this
*  is the right thing to do.
*  These journalists are hearing that and saying, well, it must be the right thing to do.
*  And the overall message that you're there for hearing from the news media and the White
*  House is kind of the same, which is this is the right thing to do.
*  Yes, it was an echo chamber.
*  But you know, it was still a very unpopular idea among the American public.
*  Polling at one point showed that two thirds of the American public were against it.
*  Wow.
*  At the same time, there remained one hugely consequential hurdle to the enactment of
*  NAFTA.
*  And that was the vote in the House of Representatives.
*  A bill to implement the North American Free Trade Agreement.
*  And I would say it was one of the most important debates as far as contemporary politics.
*  Mr. Speaker, for months, the people of America and its representatives have struggled with
*  the challenge of NAFTA.
*  Is it good or is it bad?
*  Will it help to expand our economy or shrink it?
*  Today the House must decide.
*  And the critics were really heard loudly in the House debate.
*  Corporate America and the big money interests have told us that NAFTA is a good deal.
*  I don't believe them.
*  People like Bernie Sanders, who was an independent at the time, spoke out passionately against
*  it.
*  Even the administration admits there will be at least 200,000 people who will lose their
*  jobs.
*  And what are we giving to them?
*  Table scraps.
*  And a lot of Democrats came out and forced against it.
*  Mr. Speaker, this debate comes down to one simple question.
*  Whose side are you on?
*  One of the leading opponents of NAFTA was David Bonyer, who was from Michigan and was
*  a House whip.
*  The working people who stand against this treaty don't have degrees from Harvard.
*  They don't study economic models.
*  But they know when the deck is stacked against them.
*  They know it's not fair to ask American workers to compete against Mexican workers who earn
*  a dollar an hour.
*  He emphasized the resentment of a lot of working class people towards the elite experts that
*  were telling them that they couldn't understand the possible benefits to them.
*  But there were a lot of Democratic representatives that were more favorable to NAFTA.
*  Understandably, many members of this body and citizens of this country are concerned
*  about job loss.
*  I am too.
*  I am supporting this agreement because job creation and exports go hand in hand.
*  Madam Chairman, I rise in support today.
*  And in all honesty, a decision of this kind has been a tough call for someone from my
*  region of the country.
*  The fact is that change is not something to fear.
*  We are sending a message about whether the world's only superpower thinks its best days
*  are in the past or in the future.
*  NAFTA is neither heaven nor hell.
*  It's neither nirvana nor the depths of depression.
*  It just makes good sense for America's economic future.
*  I urge my colleagues to vote for it.
*  And then there was the vote.
*  On this vote, the yeas are 234, the nays are 200, and the bill is passed.
*  And it passes narrowly, 234 to 200.
*  This is a decisive moment for the Democratic Party.
*  The vast majority of Republicans voted for NAFTA.
*  But it was crucial that Democrats had supported it, more than 100 of them.
*  Bill Clinton's trade representative later said George Bush could have never passed
*  NAFTA, that it had to have been a Democrat.
*  It had to have been Bill Clinton.
*  He said no Republican president could have, because he couldn't have brought enough Democrats.
*  The Senate soon passed the bill three days later.
*  And in early December 1993, Bill Clinton signs NAFTA into law.
*  So Dan, once NAFTA goes from theoretical and the debate is over into a day-to-day free
*  trade reality across North America, what ends up happening?
*  Well GDP is increasing.
*  The economy is booming on a lot of levels for a lot of people.
*  But it also launches the free trade juggernaut.
*  Several years later, Bill Clinton is able to establish permanent normal trade relations
*  with China.
*  Meanwhile, in the United States, a lot of factories are moving overseas.
*  Between 1997 and 2020, more than 90,000 American plants closed.
*  Some five million manufacturing jobs were lost.
*  This translated into loss of union jobs and a tremendous rise in income inequality.
*  Most of the benefits for NAFTA were going to wealthier people.
*  So while it was a net gain for the country as a whole, it wasn't within the country.
*  In other words, the people that don't have a college degree are hurt by trade deals with
*  low-wage countries.
*  And you know, it's important to remember that more than 60% of the population does not have
*  a college degree.
*  There was a British behavioral scientist that did a study of wellness and he found that
*  the psychological toll of losing a job is equivalent to losing your spouse.
*  So it's no wonder that people feel that their lives have been totally destroyed.
*  And this pain is concentrated very heavily in a lot of the Rust Belt states, Michigan,
*  Ohio and my own home state of Wisconsin, where we start to see the human and political impacts
*  from NAFTA.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Dan, tell us what you have found through all your reporting in Wisconsin about the
*  of NAFTA on workers, jobs, and over time on the politics of that place.
*  Sure.
*  Wisconsin is one of the places where NAFTA's dark side has really become clear.
*  Milwaukee, which is the state's biggest city and the industrial center of the state, it
*  was once known as the machine shop of the world, produced truck frames, agricultural
*  machinery, motors, industrial controls.
*  It's important to understand that deindustrialization was already happening before NAFTA passed.
*  Between 1979 and 1983, Milwaukee had already lost a quarter of its manufacturing jobs.
*  And then you have NAFTA, which really accelerated this process.
*  And one of the companies that I paid particular attention to is Master Lock.
*  Everybody knows their iconic padlocks.
*  These are the locks literally you use on your high school locker.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Troll the dial.
*  Those combination locks, right.
*  They've been making locks in Milwaukee since the 1920s.
*  And the plant was a smaller industrial factory at its peak.
*  It employed about 1300 people.
*  But everyone I spoke to loved working there.
*  It was something that was deeply embedded in the city's sort of industrial consciousness.
*  And after NAFTA passes, they did what a lot of other companies were doing.
*  They built a plant in Mexico.
*  In their case, this plant in Nogales was quickly taking jobs from the Milwaukee plant.
*  Within a two or three year period, a thousand union positions were sent abroad.
*  But the plant kept going and it kept employing people, although on much smaller scale than
*  it used to.
*  And one of the people that I spent time with recently is a very interesting worker named
*  Chansey Adams.
*  Chansey, man.
*  What's up?
*  How you doing?
*  Doing good.
*  And he helped me really understand the impact of NAFTA on him and on the wider community
*  and really on American politics as a whole.
*  Just start at the beginning.
*  What was it like growing up in Milwaukee when you were, this was like in the 80s and 90s?
*  It was hard, but it wasn't, if that makes sense what I'm trying to say.
*  Tell us about Chansey Adams.
*  What should we know?
*  Well, Chansey was born in 1980, grew up on the north side of Milwaukee.
*  I come up in a single family home, so me and my brother, my sister, and my mother.
*  He was raised by a single mom.
*  She was a cook at a Milwaukee museum.
*  I mean, she was a hard worker.
*  She went to work and make sure we had everything we needed and we came up and never went hungry,
*  never went without clothes or anything, you know.
*  What about the neighborhood you grew up in?
*  Just describe what it was like when you were a kid.
*  It was great to me, you know, it's like I grew up on 9th and Burla.
*  So there was a lot of bad things going on down there.
*  It was a lot of drug dealing and stuff like that, but I don't have nothing bad to say
*  about where I grew up in my childhood.
*  It was good.
*  When you were young, what did you do for fun in the neighborhood?
*  He described a happy childhood biking around with his friends.
*  I rode past Masses like a thousand, thousand times as a kid, you know.
*  One of the places where they biked around were the plants on the north side of Milwaukee.
*  This was a city that's deeply entwined with its industrial history and Milwaukee is filled
*  with these factories.
*  Miller, Masterlotte, Bridges and Stratton, A.O. Smith.
*  Those were the places where a lot of people from the south came.
*  My family was Bridges, Stratton and A.O. Smith.
*  Them the plants they got in.
*  And these are places where Chansey's relatives worked.
*  Growing up, you hear older people talk like, them are the places where you want to be.
*  And it was like solid, good wage.
*  Good wage.
*  And you can tell when we were kids, we'd be riding there and you'd see the cars out there.
*  You see all nice cars going to work.
*  We knew that was money.
*  So if you was like my age then and you figure, hey, I'm not going to college, but I'm going
*  to, these are one of the jobs that you was going to try to get.
*  Eventually, a friend of his who had gotten a job at Masterlotte calls him and says, you
*  know, you should really apply here.
*  Let me try it out.
*  And he actually got me in.
*  So he applies for a job at Masterlotte as a temp and gets one in 2010.
*  Now Dan, you had said there isn't a ton of Masterlotte left after NAFTA.
*  So by the time Chansey gets a job there in 2010, how much of Masterlotte is there for
*  him to really join in Milwaukee?
*  There's only a couple hundred union positions at that point.
*  Chansey started out at a little more than $10 an hour, but Chansey talked so much about
*  how immediately he took to it.
*  You know, I see a lot of these older men and the things they accumulated in life working
*  at this plant and the work they put in.
*  And I'm like, you know, that's what I want right there.
*  For Chansey and a lot of the workers, while the starting wage was low, there was a lot
*  of room for advancement to skilled jobs that paid much, much more.
*  How much does Chansey and everyone else among these several hundred workers who are still
*  at Masterlotte, how much do they worry that what's left of this company would eventually
*  be outsourced under the incentives of NAFTA?
*  I think some feared it, but many felt like they were secure.
*  They had highly specialized jobs.
*  And there was another reason they felt this sense of security.
*  Do you remember when President Obama came to the plant?
*  Yeah, that was my first year there.
*  First or second year.
*  In 2012, Barack Obama paid a visit to Masterlotte.
*  I'm actually here today because this company has been making the most of a huge opportunity
*  that exists right now to bring jobs and manufacturing back to the United States of America.
*  I knew it wasn't going nowhere.
*  He was there on the strip of how Masterlotte has been bringing jobs back.
*  By then, Masterlotte had increased its Milwaukee workforce to a little more than 300.
*  Some people told me it was because they'd had a few challenges manufacturing overseas.
*  So there was a modest reshoring, but something that was trumpeted by the President of the
*  United States.
*  We're going to create more success stories like Masterlotte, and we will remind the world
*  just why it is the United States is the greatest nation on earth.
*  Thank you everybody.
*  God bless you.
*  God bless America.
*  I just happened to be so close.
*  So when he came off the stage, he was just shaking everybody's hand, and I was right
*  there.
*  So I shook his hand and everything.
*  How did it make you feel?
*  I'm the man.
*  I mean, you got to think about where I come from, where I come from.
*  I just shook the President's hand.
*  Because I didn't really know too much about politics and stuff like that.
*  And I was in the Union now, and I was learning a little bit at a time.
*  And for Chansey, this is a big moment.
*  He had never been politically active, but he had started getting involved with the Union.
*  And here he is, meeting the President of the United States, who the Union is heavily supporting.
*  So I voted.
*  And he votes for the first time in his life for Barack Obama.
*  He the man.
*  They called me Obama at the plant because I was the first black guy to run the hydromats
*  at Mashallot.
*  And he starts moving up at the plant.
*  He learns to operate a complex machine called a hydromat.
*  And now he's making $20 an hour.
*  He's working a lot, sometimes seven days a week, making a lot of overtime.
*  And he buys his first house.
*  When I met the guy over here I bought the house from, he used to work at Mashallot.
*  And I got my keys and all of that.
*  And I sat on my stairs over here and I cried.
*  Because like, I'm sitting on these stairs right now.
*  I'm sitting on my sweat right now.
*  I worked hard.
*  And I bought my first house.
*  And I bought it at 35 or something.
*  By myself.
*  Eventually he's earning more than $30 an hour.
*  And not only is his job at Mashallot helping him grow a nest egg and support his family,
*  he's got four kids.
*  But it's a real source of pride for him.
*  My mother was very, my sister and brother, they very proud of it.
*  My brother work now.
*  He said one of the things that gets him up in the morning knowing that I'm up in the
*  morning.
*  I know Lil Bro up.
*  I know he going to work.
*  Oh, let me get up.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's a beautiful feeling to be the little brother and have everybody look up to your
*  work ethic and see where you come from and see what you're accumulating.
*  I did become a man in that plant.
*  It made me realize I'm a good man.
*  I feel good about myself.
*  I feel good going to work every day and coming in and the younger guys looking at me, how
*  I looked at the older guys when I was coming in young.
*  They see me in my uniform.
*  They see me with a nice haircut, smelling good.
*  They know that it's strictly sweat that's got me what I got.
*  So it makes you feel great.
*  I wasn't going anywhere.
*  Tell me about May 24th last year.
*  At the beginning of the day was a normal day.
*  The supervisor, he came to us and said we have the town hall.
*  So we go upstairs, but the whole scenery was different.
*  The chairs was turned a certain way.
*  It was tables barricaded and it was armed guards up there.
*  So I'm like, whoa, what's going on?
*  And he announced it.
*  I have some bad news.
*  I'm here to inform y'all of March of 24, the plant will be closing.
*  And the whole room was silent.
*  No explanation.
*  No nothing.
*  A couple people got up and walked out.
*  Some ladies started crying.
*  Some men were just angry.
*  Some guys said, I knew it.
*  I knew it.
*  What were you feeling when you heard the news?
*  I went numb.
*  And then I got a sense of being scared.
*  I put my whole life around this place.
*  I don't know nothing else.
*  You know, like, what am I going to do?
*  I got responsibilities here.
*  What am I supposed to do now?
*  I'm 43 years old.
*  Starting all the way over.
*  So 30 years after NAFTA passed, the Master Lock plant in Milwaukee is finally closing.
*  That's right.
*  It's the final chapter on the Milwaukee story of Master Lock.
*  Some of these jobs will go to other places.
*  But one union official told me that most of them will go to the company's plant in Nogales,
*  Mexico.
*  So what happens to Chansey?
*  Well, Chansey is really in a kind of desperate state.
*  He's scrambling.
*  No one wanted to hire me.
*  He applies for jobs.
*  Nothing is coming through.
*  But then a coworker at Master Lock gets him a job at another factory.
*  But he's making a lot less than what he used to at Master Lock.
*  So I had to get another job.
*  I was going to lose my house.
*  So he eventually picks up a second job.
*  I get there by 5 a.m.
*  Now his days start very early.
*  I get done.
*  So usually about 9 o'clock, 930.
*  And very late.
*  And then I have to come right home and try to eat something, jump in the bed, and get
*  up again at 345.
*  He hardly has any time for himself except a little bit on the weekends.
*  So it's a constant moving, constant grind, constant no sitting down.
*  And it's tiring, you know, mentally, really.
*  I keep thinking back to the Democrats on the House floor who warned that this is what
*  was going to happen.
*  And for a time in listening to you tell this story about Chansey, it feels that he's the
*  exception.
*  You know, he's not going to be hurt by NAFTA.
*  But it feels like one of the morals of this story is that NAFTA kind of comes for almost
*  everyone when it comes to these plants in the upper Midwest.
*  Yeah, I think that's true.
*  And there's so many ways that NAFTA has shifted the power balance.
*  You know, we talked a lot about the closing of these plants.
*  But it's also true that NAFTA gave companies enormous leverage even just to threaten to
*  close the plant.
*  And that they could extract steep concessions on unions and others to lower their wages.
*  It's a real downward pressure on working class Americans.
*  We talked about this a bit.
*  I just want to make sure.
*  So you're not planning to vote this year?
*  No, I'm done with that.
*  It's pointless.
*  I haven't benefited off of nothing that any president had ever done.
*  It's always been taken from me.
*  If you're poor or right in the middle of poor and middle class, you're going to bust your
*  ass, man, to get what you want.
*  There's no help.
*  That's why I have no respect for politics, presidents.
*  And it changed me.
*  Do you have any thoughts on Trump or Kamala Harris?
*  Trump is a crook, but he gangster.
*  I love that guy.
*  He don't care.
*  The only good thing I can say about Trump, he's a businessman.
*  He'll be successful that way, I think.
*  Kamala Harris, she's just a crook.
*  Everybody keep getting on this black wave, black wave, because they're black.
*  You should vote my own.
*  I don't care what color you are.
*  You suck.
*  You suck.
*  I definitely have no faith in her.
*  If I was to vote and I had to choose between the two, I would vote for Trump.
*  At the beginning of our conversation, you talked about this idea that NAFTA and its
*  aftermath turned the Democrats from the party of the working class into the party of college-educated
*  elites, which helps me understand in a way I don't think I ever really did before just
*  how much of an opening Republicans had to remake themselves into the party that exploits
*  that.
*  And that obviously comes in the candidacy of Donald Trump.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  Free trade is the mantra of both parties.
*  It's what's coming out of Washington until the 2016 election.
*  I'm going to say something that conservatives don't like, because while I'm a free trader,
*  I'm a smart trader.
*  I'm a fair trader.
*  I know what I'm doing.
*  Donald Trump emphasized an economic nationalist message.
*  And you're losing plants over here.
*  And you're losing a plant over there.
*  Highlighting the job losses from NAFTA and other free trade deals.
*  Any direction I can point to, you're losing jobs, you're losing your plants.
*  We're not going to let it happen anymore.
*  So now you have an incredible shift in the Republican Party.
*  The party that created NAFTA in the first place is now opposed to it, at least rhetorically.
*  And of course, the Democratic candidate he faces is none other than Hillary Clinton.
*  Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the
*  manufacturing industry.
*  And in the presidential debates, NAFTA becomes one of the most important issues.
*  NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this
*  country.
*  And now Trump rails against it, calls it the worst deal ever made.
*  I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.
*  I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again.
*  Well, he approved NAFTA.
*  But Clinton largely defends it.
*  Which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.
*  Incomes went up for everybody.
*  What was it, do you think, in this debate and in this campaign that made Hillary Clinton
*  and the Democrats so confident that NAFTA, opposition to it, was a losing strategy for
*  Trump?
*  Because clearly she could have mimicked his position.
*  She could have said, you know, we've come a long way and I think that NAFTA did have
*  some real problems.
*  Well, I think she made a political calculation.
*  It was really articulated very well by Senator Chuck Schumer in the summer of 2016 in the
*  lead up to the election.
*  He said, for every blue collar Democrat we lose in Western Pennsylvania, we will pick
*  up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia.
*  And you can repeat that in Ohio, in Illinois, in Wisconsin.
*  Can you just translate that?
*  What is he saying about NAFTA's impact on the politics of the parties?
*  I think he's signaling a class realignment of the party.
*  They are going to focus their efforts on winning suburban voters who tend to be wealthier
*  versus the blue collar workers that had traditionally supported the party since the New Deal.
*  That's kind of interesting.
*  So what Democrats are saying explicitly, and it sounds like an on the record quote, is
*  we recognize that we have now become a party whose appeal is to higher income, higher educated
*  Americans and we may be forsaking a certain kind of working class voter in Western Pennsylvania
*  or Wisconsin and we're okay with that because we think the math favors us.
*  Exactly, exactly right.
*  And this kind of thinking was so embedded in Hillary Clinton's campaign that she didn't
*  visit Wisconsin once during the general election.
*  In the end, Trump wins the presidency very narrowly by flipping three of the so-called
*  blue wall states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
*  This is something no Republican had done in more than 30 years and I don't think it's
*  a surprise that these states were some of the hardest hit by NAFTA and similar free
*  trade agreements.
*  And Trump did renegotiate NAFTA in 2018 with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement.
*  It made modest improvements in conditions for Mexican workers to disincentivize the
*  movement of jobs and factories to Mexico.
*  But it doesn't seem as though that's worked.
*  Last year, for example, Stellantis, one of the big three, moved some production to a
*  plant in Mexico and of course Master Lock has closed its Milwaukee factory.
*  But on paper and kind of symbolically to voters, Trump did fulfill a pledge to go after the
*  original NAFTA.
*  That is true and that is what he's campaigning on.
*  Like a lot of Trump's promises, they didn't really ever come through and he actually passed
*  tax cuts that incentivized offshoring of jobs.
*  On the Democratic side, you had also a real realignment.
*  President Biden and Vice President Harris increased the tariffs that Trump had established
*  on certain Chinese products, such as electric vehicles.
*  Biden has also emphasized his closeness to labor unions in a way that previous Democrats
*  for generations had not.
*  And he's really courted them and was the first president to walk on the picket line, which
*  is very significant when you think back on the NAFTA debate and Bill Clinton is pushing
*  aside the concerns of organized labor.
*  We should point out that this is a somewhat meaningful thing for Biden to do because he
*  was in the Senate when NAFTA passed.
*  He voted for NAFTA.
*  He did vote for NAFTA and he voted for the agreement establishing permanent normal trade
*  relations with China.
*  Right.
*  Dan, it feels like Biden's journey here is emblematic of the journey of the entire Democratic
*  Party because what you have by the end of Biden's presidency is a situation where Democrats
*  who brought NAFTA over the line and really gave us our current free trade era under Bill
*  Clinton and then who watched Republicans exploit the fallout from it under Donald Trump,
*  Democrats now themselves have said, you know what, this all went too far.
*  And Biden and the Democrats, I'm sure probably wouldn't put it this way, but their rhetoric
*  now on free trade, on things like NAFTA has moved a lot closer to Trump's.
*  I have to believe that's because they now recognize what NAFTA did to the working class.
*  Yeah, I think that's true.
*  And by the time we enter this campaign, both parties are critical of the free trade agreements
*  of the past.
*  Kamala Harris, one of her first events with Tim Walz, was at a UAW hall in Michigan and
*  she has really emphasized the importance of good paying jobs.
*  Whether it's too little or too late is an open question.
*  You're talking about 50 years of deindustrialization and that was greatly accelerated and intensified
*  by NAFTA and the free trade deals that followed it.
*  If you could say anything to Trump or Kamala Harris about your life and your experiences
*  with master law growing up in Milwaukee, what would you tell them?
*  What would you want them to know?
*  One of the main things you people need to do is keep these jobs in the United States,
*  man.
*  These are people's livelihoods.
*  People get up and go to work every day, not even getting paid what they're worth to eat.
*  And then they snatch it.
*  They take it away with ease and the people that's taking it away is well off.
*  They don't have to worry about these struggles.
*  I think it tells a larger story of American working class disaffection that's rooted in
*  a response to NAFTA.
*  That response isn't always rational or linear.
*  Sometimes it's unpredictable.
*  Trump seized on that, making wild promises that appealed to a lot of people in desperate
*  times.
*  The Democrats have started to shift away from that, focusing more on what I think is the
*  most underappreciated issue in American politics.
*  And it's so simple and almost banal, but it's really jobs and it's particularly well paying
*  jobs and what that means to a person that doesn't have a college degree, that sense
*  that they're okay and their family's okay and who's the best person that's going to
*  help make those jobs and give them this opportunity.
*  Well Dan, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  It was really a pleasure talking with you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  By Monday night, Hurricane Milton had strengthened at an explosive pace, becoming a lethal Category
*  5 storm with winds of 180 miles per hour.
*  It's just an incredible, incredible, incredible hurricane.
*  Milton is expected to make landfall on Wednesday.
*  Its exact path is still taking shape, but forecasters predict it will bring life-threatening
*  wind, rain, and flooding to coastal Florida, where local meteorologist John Morales of
*  NBC News was briefly overcome with emotion as he tried to capture the storm's scale.
*  It has dropped 50 millibars in 10 hours.
*  I apologize.
*  This is just horrific.
*  The maximum sustained winds are 160.
*  Florida officials have ordered evacuations across at least 12 counties and have suspended
*  in order to keep traffic moving as quickly as possible.
*  What would you say to people tonight who are saying, you know what, I'm going to ride
*  this out, I've written others out?
*  What would you say to people who aren't heeding those evacuation orders?
*  I can say without any dramatization whatsoever, if you choose to stay in one of those evacuation
*  areas, you're going to die.
*  Wow.
