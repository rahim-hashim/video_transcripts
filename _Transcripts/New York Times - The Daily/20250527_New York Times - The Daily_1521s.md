# A New Front Line for Abortion Rights
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=0.0s)]
*  After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, abortions in the United States actually [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  went up. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=18.64s)]
*  In part, that's because of a novel legal strategy that ended up pitting blue states [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=19.64s)]
*  against red states. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=24.8s)]
*  Today, my colleague Pam Bellack explains the strategy and the two cases that could take [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=26.6s)]
*  it apart. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=32.36s)]
*  It's Tuesday, May 27th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=43.36s)]
*  So, Pam, we haven't talked about abortion on the show for a while. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=45.36s)]
*  And in the years since Roe v. Wade fell, the country has kind of splintered into states [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=56.0s)]
*  where abortion is banned and states where abortion is not banned. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  And that's just sort of been the state of play that everybody has their own state laws [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=64.7s)]
*  that they have to abide by. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=68.6s)]
*  But in reality, as you have been paying attention to and covering, there's actually been this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=70.32s)]
*  showdown brewing that now looks poised to upend that whole order that we've maybe grown [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=76.82s)]
*  a bit accustomed to in the last few years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=82.55999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, a lot has been happening during this time beyond the different ballot measures [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  that we've been hearing and different state laws and things like that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=90.41999999999999s)]
*  One of the major developments has been these new legal protections called shield laws. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=94.38s)]
*  And they have become both one of the biggest legal developments in the abortion access [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=101.22s)]
*  space and also a major reason why women in states with abortion bans are still able to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=106.78s)]
*  get access to abortion. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=113.34s)]
*  Okay, so let's talk about shield laws. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=114.94s)]
*  First of all, what are they? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=117.62s)]
*  So almost immediately after Roe was overturned, you have conservative states, red states, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=120.18s)]
*  putting into place abortion bans that were and are very strict. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=127.34s)]
*  So they make abortion illegal in almost all cases. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=132.5s)]
*  There are a few exceptions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=136.62s)]
*  And they have penalties for anybody who is providing abortion, helping people travel [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=138.66s)]
*  for an abortion. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=146.58s)]
*  To states where it's legal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=147.9s)]
*  To states where it's legal, exactly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=149.16s)]
*  And this raises some legal questions for providers in blue states. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=151.32s)]
*  Are they putting themselves at risk if they provide abortion to a patient from a red state [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=155.94s)]
*  with an abortion ban? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=160.78s)]
*  When the Supreme Court drought opinion was leaked showing that Roe versus Wade could [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=161.78s)]
*  possibly be overturned, the state legislature here in New York acted immediately. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=165.22s)]
*  Welcome back another step in making California a sanctuary for abortion. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=169.72s)]
*  Oregon lawmakers are working on a bill that would further protect the right to abortion [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=174.12s)]
*  in Oregon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=177.86s)]
*  Senate Bill 1 ensures a woman's right to choose an abortion in Hawaii, protects health [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=178.86s)]
*  care workers who provide... [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=183.10000000000002s)]
*  So what starts to develop are these laws which basically say, if you provide an abortion [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  to a patient from a state with an abortion ban, we will protect you. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=190.38000000000002s)]
*  Hence shield law. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=194.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=197.34s)]
*  And how exactly do these shield laws say they would protect the providers? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  So a shield law is basically a cooperation blockade. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=208.72s)]
*  So it says here in our shield law state, we will not cooperate with another state that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  is trying to sue or prosecute a resident in our state who is involved in an abortion. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=218.96s)]
*  So that's really starkly different from the way states usually do cooperate. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=226.96s)]
*  And usually, you know, one state files charges against somebody in another state and the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  state where that person is will extradite that person, will share records, will respond [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=237.8s)]
*  to subpoenas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=244.28s)]
*  But under shield laws, abortion providers and people involved in providing abortions [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  to people from red states are protected. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=251.72s)]
*  And the officials in those shield law states are required not to cooperate, not to extradite. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=256.32s)]
*  So even though these providers are doing something that is legal in their state, those states [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=264.24s)]
*  are being extra cautious, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=269.76s)]
*  They're basically saying, hey, don't worry, we are not going to let you get into trouble. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=270.96000000000004s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  So the first shield law that passed protected providers who served patients who traveled [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=277.16s)]
*  from states with abortion bans to the blue state. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=283.36s)]
*  But of course, providers in blue states who were making abortion available to people who [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=286.68s)]
*  came to them were only serving part of the need for abortion access. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=291.84s)]
*  A lot of women seeking abortions can't travel for one reason or another. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=297.88s)]
*  It's expensive. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  It's very time consuming. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=305.88s)]
*  And there's also, you know, explaining to everybody around them in their community, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=308.38s)]
*  why are you suddenly leaving the state for a few days? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=313.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not just like money and time and childcare, which I guess is maybe a form of money and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  time, but it's also about privacy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=320.52s)]
*  Who needs to be involved in this process? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=322.64s)]
*  Who do you have to tell who needs to know about something that is for many women very [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=324.2s)]
*  deeply private? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=327.0s)]
*  And for many women, there is an easier and more preferable pathway to getting an abortion. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=328.78s)]
*  And that's through abortion medication early in pregnancy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=334.64s)]
*  And this has become a much more common way of getting an abortion, so much so that even [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=339.64s)]
*  before Roe was overturned, more than half of abortions in this country were being carried [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=345.52s)]
*  out with abortion pills. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=351.32s)]
*  Those pills, just to be clear, are the drugs Mifopristone and Misoprostol. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=357.0s)]
*  And before the pandemic, the FDA had regulations that required patients to go to a doctor or [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=358.0s)]
*  another abortion provider to pick up the Mifopristone, the first drug in person. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=365.96s)]
*  And that, of course, was limiting for people. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=373.2s)]
*  Not everybody can go to a clinic. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=374.92s)]
*  Not every doctor is a certified prescriber. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=376.6s)]
*  But during the pandemic, the FDA started to change those rules and allowed the medications [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=379.24s)]
*  to be prescribed by telemedicine without seeing a doctor and mailed to wherever the patient [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=385.76s)]
*  was. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=393.52s)]
*  So after Roe was overturned, there was a realization that you could send abortion pills in the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=394.52s)]
*  mail to any state, including states with bans. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=401.08s)]
*  And that's why several states start to adopt either new shield laws or amended shield laws [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=405.56s)]
*  that explicitly say that they will protect an abortion provider who is prescribing and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  sending abortion pills through the mail to patients in states with bans. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=421.79999999999995s)]
*  So instead of providers just treating women who come to their states where abortion is [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=426.2s)]
*  legal, what you've described is abortion providers essentially bringing the abortion to these [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=430.68s)]
*  women in their states where abortion is not legal. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think that sounds pretty risky for the providers, no? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=441.88s)]
*  It's definitely riskier for the providers for sure. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  I think these types of laws are really unusual and they really haven't been tested. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=448.64s)]
*  So it's a question whether they will ultimately stand. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  I think that's why you don't see that many abortion providers doing it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=459.6s)]
*  It takes a kind of special personality and somebody who's comfortable with that level [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=464.48s)]
*  of risk. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=470.56s)]
*  Many of these providers are people who are kind of more advanced in their careers and [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=472.2s)]
*  maybe their children are grown and they just feel like they have a little bit less to lose. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  Obviously some of them have kind of protected their assets and put them in trust, but still [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=482.88s)]
*  they are absolutely taking a lot of chances and they know that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=488.08s)]
*  They're well aware of that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=492.48s)]
*  I mean, they go into this eyes open because they are really very committed to providing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=493.48s)]
*  this access and they see it as a really important avenue and it has become that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  Shield law providers are now sending probably more than 10,000 pills a month to women in [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=504.14s)]
*  states with abortion bans. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=513.24s)]
*  I know Pam that we've said on the show before that since Dab's abortions have actually gone [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=514.72s)]
*  up, which feels kind of surprising. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=519.0799999999999s)]
*  Is this the reason why? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=523.0s)]
*  This is part of the reason. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  And these shield laws have put red states in a situation where they are trying to figure [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=527.4599999999999s)]
*  out how to stop these medications from flowing into their states. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=533.56s)]
*  And for a while they've been looking for cases that would allow them to try to challenge [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=540.48s)]
*  these shield laws. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=548.82s)]
*  And eventually they found it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=552.1600000000001s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=563.6400000000001s)]
*  Pam, tell us about the case that you mentioned before the break, the one that anti-abortion [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=570.6400000000001s)]
*  activists have been waiting for. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=574.0400000000001s)]
*  Who was involved? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=575.5400000000001s)]
*  What was it about? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=576.82s)]
*  Yeah, so it's actually two cases from two different states. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=577.82s)]
*  They just happened to involve the same New York doctor, Dr. Margaret Carpenter. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=580.48s)]
*  Dr. Carpenter lives in New Paltz, New York, and she has been a long time reproductive [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=585.6400000000001s)]
*  health provider. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  Under shield laws she's been prescribing abortion pills to patients in all 50 states. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=594.92s)]
*  A New York doctor faces a penalty after allegedly prescribing abortion pills to a Texas resident. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  Tonight Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing a doctor in New York who prescribes... [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=607.8s)]
*  This is one of the first challenges of the so-called shield laws, and it sets up a fight [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=612.28s)]
*  between Texas and New York. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=616.4s)]
*  So the first case is actually a civil suit that was brought against Dr. Carpenter, and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=619.0s)]
*  that suit accuses Dr. Carpenter of prescribing and sending abortion medication to a 20-year-old [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=624.72s)]
*  woman in Texas last summer. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  And it says that after the woman took the pills, she asked her partner to take her to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=633.1600000000001s)]
*  the emergency room because she was bleeding. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=637.48s)]
*  Now it's worth noting that medication abortion is very safe and that bleeding is part of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=639.96s)]
*  what happens during a medication abortion process because it is the pregnancy tissue [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=645.48s)]
*  being expelled. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=651.32s)]
*  And so it's not that uncommon for women to wonder if they're bleeding at an appropriate [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=653.2s)]
*  level and there apparently her partner learned that she was nine weeks pregnant and he suspected [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=659.6s)]
*  that she wasn't just having a miscarriage. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=669.16s)]
*  So he went back to their home and he found the medications with Dr. Carpenter's name [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=672.96s)]
*  on the prescription and he reported this to the Attorney General's office. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=680.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=683.72s)]
*  In a statement, Paxton said, in Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=684.72s)]
*  babies... [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  And so in December of last year, the Attorney General of Texas sued Dr. Carpenter for basically [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  violating Texas's abortion ban. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=695.76s)]
*  And so under the shield law, Dr. Carpenter and her lawyers did not respond to the civil [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=701.12s)]
*  suit. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=708.2s)]
*  They didn't show up in court. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=709.2s)]
*  They didn't file any sort of response. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=710.2s)]
*  And so as a result, a judge in the case has ordered a fine of about $113,000 and also [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=712.36s)]
*  issued a permanent injunction that says Dr. Carpenter is prevented from sending abortion [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=720.32s)]
*  pills to patients in Texas again. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=728.1800000000001s)]
*  So Dr. Carpenter's strategy is essentially trust the shield law and ignore what's happening [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=730.92s)]
*  in Texas. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=734.92s)]
*  So what is Texas's strategy to get her to pay the fine? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=736.2199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=740.3199999999999s)]
*  So this is where the showdown with the shield law is being set up, right? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  Texas judge issues a punishment and now Texas wants to enforce its punishment. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=746.92s)]
*  And so this spring, the state of Texas goes to New York, to the county where Dr. Carpenter [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=753.4599999999999s)]
*  lives, and it tries to file a document that says, we are asking you, New York, to compel [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=759.04s)]
*  Dr. Carpenter to pay up and to honor the injunction. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=765.48s)]
*  And the New York clerk says, hold up. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=769.4399999999999s)]
*  No, we are not even accepting this court document from you. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=773.16s)]
*  We're not even going to let you establish a case number here. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=777.52s)]
*  We are just not having it under the shield law. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm a little surprised to hear that a local clerk would know about this law and also be [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=786.28s)]
*  able to like unilaterally stand up to a judgment like this. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=792.2s)]
*  Should I be surprised or is that just ignorance on my part? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=795.84s)]
*  Well it's definitely an unusual thing for a county clerk to be doing in most cases. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=799.0s)]
*  But in this situation, New York has been one of the states that has really made a big deal [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=804.9200000000001s)]
*  out of their shield law and their determination to protect abortion rights in this way. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=810.64s)]
*  And so they have educated and trained officials across the state to be ready if something [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=815.2s)]
*  like this comes across their desk. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=823.48s)]
*  In this case, the county clerk was ready and said, sorry, we are stopping you before you [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=825.72s)]
*  even reach the courthouse door. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=831.9200000000001s)]
*  So right now we have a legal standoff, right? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=834.5200000000001s)]
*  We have a civil judgment in Texas that Texas is not able to enforce. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=838.96s)]
*  And what about the other case against Dr. Carpenter that you mentioned? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=845.48s)]
*  What's that one about? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=848.36s)]
*  Yeah, so that case is from Louisiana and it's a criminal case that was brought in January [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=849.36s)]
*  of this year. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=855.12s)]
*  And in that case a grand jury in Louisiana indicted Dr. Carpenter on charges of providing [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=856.8000000000001s)]
*  abortion inducing drugs. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=862.84s)]
*  As with the Texas case, we really don't know a lot of details about the Louisiana case. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=866.48s)]
*  The description of what happened is coming directly from authorities in the states themselves. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=873.08s)]
*  So it's just worth noting that they are painting a picture of how these cases unfolded in a [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=878.76s)]
*  particular way and we don't independently know if what they're saying is accurate. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=885.12s)]
*  What the district attorney in Louisiana has said is that there was a teenager, someone [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=890.04s)]
*  under 18, her mother helped her order abortion pills. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=897.64s)]
*  It turned out that Dr. Carpenter was the prescriber and mailed those pills. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=902.64s)]
*  And the district attorney says that the teenager was sort of pressed by her mother to take [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=910.16s)]
*  the abortion pills and then at some point the teenager called 911 and was taken to a [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=917.12s)]
*  hospital. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=924.96s)]
*  We don't really know why. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=925.96s)]
*  And that's where authorities learned that she had taken abortion pills. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=927.88s)]
*  Dr. Carpenter has been indicted for providing this medication and the mother of the teenager [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=937.88s)]
*  has also been indicted and has pleaded not guilty. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=944.8s)]
*  So when one person in one state is indicted by another state, then that state that's indicted [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=965.8s)]
*  them, tries to extradite them, tries to get them to come in and face the criminal charges [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=971.84s)]
*  in court because otherwise that case can't proceed. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=975.24s)]
*  You know, criminal cases different from civil cases, the defendant has to be there. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=978.24s)]
*  So if she doesn't show up and they don't try to force her to show up, then it won't proceed. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=982.44s)]
*  Louisiana has done that. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=989.68s)]
*  They've issued an extradition warrant. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=990.68s)]
*  Which as you've told us is going to be hard to execute from a blue state that has a shield law. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=992.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=997.64s)]
*  Louisiana has changed their laws, but that has no bearing on the laws here in the state of New York. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=999.16s)]
*  New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, has made this a real strong point. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1004.16s)]
*  I took an oath of office to protect all New Yorkers and I will uphold not only our constitution, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1010.16s)]
*  but the laws of our land. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1016.24s)]
*  And I will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1017.72s)]
*  Not now, not ever. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1023.8s)]
*  She said, no way, no how, we are not sending Dr. Carpenter to Louisiana. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1028.56s)]
*  So that's where the case stands at the moment. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1032.56s)]
*  Again, sort of a standoff. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1034.76s)]
*  It's possible that Louisiana will try to go to a New York court and challenge New York's [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1037.12s)]
*  refusal to extradite, but they haven't done that yet. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1043.84s)]
*  But it certainly sends a chilling shot across the bow to all the other shield law providers [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1047.56s)]
*  who are doing this. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1052.3999999999999s)]
*  I actually want to ask you about that shot across the bow thing because I'm really curious [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1054.2s)]
*  how people in the abortion access space are interpreting what's happening with these two [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1059.8000000000002s)]
*  cases because in both of them, it feels like at least for now, New York's shield law is [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1064.24s)]
*  kind of standing in the way of Texas and Louisiana prevailing. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1069.96s)]
*  But as you've said, the anti-abortion activists are trying to use these cases to challenge [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1072.88s)]
*  the shield law in New York. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1077.8000000000002s)]
*  So I'm curious, what is the next step for Texas and Louisiana to potentially continue [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1079.6399999999999s)]
*  to challenge this? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1085.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think most people expect that there will be a next step, that these are supposed [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1086.6s)]
*  to be test cases to basically try to undercut the protection of shield laws. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1091.66s)]
*  So most people expect that Texas and or Louisiana will keep pursuing this. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  They will end up in federal court, possibly the Supreme Court, and they will try to say [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1105.24s)]
*  that the shield laws are unconstitutional. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1111.0400000000002s)]
*  And there may also be a challenge to the question of whether a state can decide not to extradite [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1114.3600000000001s)]
*  someone who's been criminally charged in another state. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1121.72s)]
*  So basically, this is going to end up as a showdown where this whole concept of shield [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1125.48s)]
*  which is largely untested will end up being run through the middle of the federal courts [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1130.8400000000001s)]
*  and we'll see if they're allowed to stand. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1136.5600000000002s)]
*  On what basis will the red states even try to challenge these laws? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1140.2s)]
*  So there are a few different legal arguments that the states can use, but the one that [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1143.88s)]
*  seems to come up the most often is that the Constitution requires states to basically [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1149.72s)]
*  respect each other's laws. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1154.96s)]
*  They have to cooperate with each other. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1156.16s)]
*  And in this case, the provision that they cite is called the full faith and credit [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1159.12s)]
*  clause. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1162.84s)]
*  I mean, I understand that, right? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1163.84s)]
*  Because the alternative would probably be chaos. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1165.04s)]
*  Like if states could just pick and choose what other states laws they were going to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1167.4799999999998s)]
*  respect. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1171.28s)]
*  So I do wonder what do blue states say in response to that? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1172.36s)]
*  Well, there are exceptions to the full faith and credit clause. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1176.84s)]
*  And one of those exceptions is that if one state has a really deeply held public policy [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1180.8s)]
*  objective, that public policy objective overrides a contradictory law in another state. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1187.3999999999999s)]
*  That's going to be one way that the legal argument is going to play out. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1194.52s)]
*  There could be others. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1197.48s)]
*  I would expect lawyers on both sides of this argument to be very creative and to think [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1198.48s)]
*  of lots of different legal and procedural roots once it comes to the federal court, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1203.6399999999999s)]
*  because that's what we've seen with other abortion cases. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1209.3999999999999s)]
*  I realize that shield laws are not at the Supreme Court yet and they would take a really [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1212.52s)]
*  long time to wind their way there. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1216.6399999999999s)]
*  But if they do make it in front of SCOTUS and if SCOTUS does decide that shield laws [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1218.48s)]
*  are unconstitutional, I wonder what happens to Dr. Carpenter. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1223.36s)]
*  And I also wonder what happens to abortion just generally across the country. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1227.12s)]
*  Well, you know, of course, we don't know exactly what would happen to Dr. Carpenter, but the [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1231.3999999999999s)]
*  charges and the cases against her could result in jail time, steep financial penalty and [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1236.1999999999998s)]
*  preventing her from continuing this work. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1243.0s)]
*  And if we were to see the shield laws get struck down by the Supreme Court, then things [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1245.5s)]
*  will be different. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1252.38s)]
*  Certainly some providers who are sending abortion pills to states with bans will stop doing [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1254.82s)]
*  that. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1259.38s)]
*  Others will probably continue, even though they'd be taking even greater risk than they're [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1260.38s)]
*  taking now. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1264.58s)]
*  And the abortion landscape in America that's already been rewritten after Roe was overturned [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1266.5s)]
*  is going to be rewritten once again. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1273.02s)]
*  I think we're going to see even starker divisions between states with abortion bans and states [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1274.9s)]
*  that protect abortion. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1281.24s)]
*  But even if the Supreme Court upholds the legality of shield laws, that doesn't mean [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1283.3000000000002s)]
*  that the practice of sending abortion pills to states with abortion bans is just going [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1289.7s)]
*  to continue without additional ways to challenge it. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1295.7s)]
*  So you're likely to see anti-abortion advocates looking for new ways to try to stop access [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1300.16s)]
*  to abortion pills, and you're likely to see abortion rights advocates looking for new [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1308.88s)]
*  ways to try to protect and expand access to abortion pills. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1314.16s)]
*  Pam, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, part of the idea at the time was [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1317.8000000000002s)]
*  that they would just send back to the states this decision about how to handle abortion. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1323.3600000000001s)]
*  So if states wanted it to be legal, they could make it legal. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1328.02s)]
*  If they didn't want it to be legal, that was up to them. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1331.18s)]
*  And that would settle it, was the thinking. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1333.96s)]
*  And you do have a patchwork of laws as a result, but what you also have are states kind of [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1336.42s)]
*  openly fighting with each other too. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1343.42s)]
*  And I just sort of wonder if you anticipated that. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1345.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people who were watching this subject and familiar with it also anticipated [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1348.62s)]
*  that this would happen because, you know, when you think about it, there just aren't [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1357.38s)]
*  very many types of medical care that differ so dramatically from state to state. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1362.28s)]
*  So it always seemed like it was going to be problematic to have one state try to ban [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1370.0s)]
*  abortion and think that that would somehow prevent women in that state from having access [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1376.8200000000002s)]
*  to abortion. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1382.76s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing now, this really fierce division between states, was something [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1384.34s)]
*  that a lot of people foresaw. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1390.6999999999998s)]
*  Pam, thank you so much. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1396.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1397.98s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1405.3799999999999s)]

*  of sharp rebukes from some of Israel's closest allies since the war started more than 18 [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2wckn03Qs&t=1425.6799999999998s)]
