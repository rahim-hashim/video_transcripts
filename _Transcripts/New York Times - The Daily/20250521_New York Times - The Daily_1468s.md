# Trump Said Peace in Ukraine Would Come Easy. It Hasn’t.
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump once approached the challenge of ending Russia's war on Ukraine as a straight [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  ahead deal, something that he could achieve easily. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=18.1s)]
*  But after months of trying, he's signaling that he might actually walk away. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=21.0s)]
*  Today, my colleague Michael Crowley on the phone call between Trump and Russian President [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=26.24s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, and what it tells us about how the conflict could end. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=31.16s)]
*  It's Wednesday, May 21st. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=37.8s)]
*  Michael, nice to speak with you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=41.56s)]
*  I don't think we've ever met before. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=45.68s)]
*  I don't think we have. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=47.6s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=48.6s)]
*  Yeah, our pleasure. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=49.6s)]
*  So Michael, we want to talk to you about this two-hour phone call that happened between [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=50.72s)]
*  President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that happened on Monday. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=55.4s)]
*  But before we get there, we haven't really checked in on the war between Russia and Ukraine [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=60.36s)]
*  since that disastrous Oval Office meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=64.6s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=69.6s)]
*  I want to understand what happened in between Trump and Zelensky kind of blowing up at each [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=71.12s)]
*  other and this call that was, I think, pretty remarkable in a few ways. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=76.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, in some ways, we are at a point that no one could have predicted back in February [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=82.0s)]
*  when Zelensky was essentially thrown out of the White House by Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=88.56s)]
*  And you know, it looked like Ukraine was cooked. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=94.48s)]
*  Trump was very angry at Zelensky and very eager by all indications to please Russian [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  President Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=104.48s)]
*  But in the weeks since then, the story has become a little more complicated. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=107.36s)]
*  There's some tension in the relationship between Trump and Putin that we've not seen before. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=113.2s)]
*  Ukraine is certainly not out of the woods yet. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  But the path to this phone call was much more winding and filled with surprises, I think, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  anyone would have expected on that day when Trump essentially berated the president of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=130.6s)]
*  Ukraine and acted as though he was finished doing business with him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=136.52s)]
*  Let's start at the beginning of that winding road. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  What was the immediate fallout from that meeting? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=143.08s)]
*  Well, Ukrainians and their supporters in Europe and the United States were basically panicking [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=146.68s)]
*  after that meeting. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=153.96s)]
*  Trump declared that Ukraine was not ready for a peace deal, a deal he promised as a [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=155.96s)]
*  candidate that he could strike in as little as one day, and suspended US military aid [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=162.88s)]
*  and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=170.28s)]
*  His attitude was, you, Zelensky, are not showing enough respect to the United States and not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=173.44s)]
*  willing enough to cut a deal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=181.16s)]
*  And we're done with you. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Good day and good luck. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  And what was happening was not only was Trump castigating Zelensky and to many people blaming [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  the victim of this Russian invasion, but accelerating his diplomacy with Moscow and talking about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=194.28s)]
*  economic deals and potentially lifting sanctions and restoring normal diplomatic relations [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=201.64s)]
*  and seeming to get very excited about this prospect that America and Russia would be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  friends. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  So how did President Zelensky respond to all of this at the time? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=214.4s)]
*  You know, I think a couple of things happened. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=218.68s)]
*  Number one, I think the Ukrainians changed their tone. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=220.56s)]
*  Zelensky was much more careful about what he said about the US and the Trump administration [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=224.52s)]
*  in public. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=231.52s)]
*  At the same time, behind the scenes, you had some European leaders acting as what one longtime [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  Russian-Ukraine expert said to me was acting as marriage counselors between President Trump [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  and the Ukrainian government. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=246.04s)]
*  And you know, Trump has no great love for much of Western Europe in particular, but [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=247.72s)]
*  he will listen to the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron of France. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  And they did a lot of work behind the scenes to try to reason with Trump and present the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=259.44s)]
*  Ukrainian position to him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=266.44s)]
*  And also, I think, to talk to Zelensky and the Ukrainians about how to interface with [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  the US government in a way that was going to put them in better standing in the White [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=272.12s)]
*  House than Zelensky was on that painful day. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  And so what happened then? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=281.96s)]
*  So one thing that happens is that Zelensky and Ukraine very cleverly shift their posture. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  They start showing a real openness to some sort of a deal with Russia. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=291.48s)]
*  You know, this is something that they had rejected for years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=297.6s)]
*  But I think that they realized that what Trump wants more than anything is some deal, any [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  deal where he can proclaim a victory. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=307.6s)]
*  So Ukraine agrees on March 11th to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  And the Trump administration rewards Ukraine for this agreement by lifting its suspension [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=318.34s)]
*  of military aid and intelligence sharing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=324.74s)]
*  Vladimir Putin will not agree to an unconditional ceasefire and accepts a very, very limited [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=327.82s)]
*  deal which falls apart quickly. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=333.82s)]
*  And I think that's an early disappointment for Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=335.53999999999996s)]
*  I think it starts to dawn on Trump in the following days and weeks that Putin is not [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=338.8s)]
*  looking for the grand deal that Trump has in mind and that Trump has been promising [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  since he was a candidate for president. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=354.38s)]
*  So it sounds like Zelensky in saying, sure, I'm open to a deal, kind of put the onus on [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=357.38s)]
*  Putin, and in so doing exposed Putin as being much less willing to negotiate the Trump may [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=362.58s)]
*  have expected or wanted. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=369.7s)]
*  Like, it sounds quite shrewd on the part of Zelensky is what I'm getting at. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=371.38s)]
*  No, it's exactly right. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=375.14s)]
*  You might call it a kind of a pull the chair strategy. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=376.58s)]
*  Putin has talked as though he is open to peace for a long time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  He strung Trump along. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=384.58s)]
*  Trump along, he strung the world along for years. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=387.26s)]
*  And something that Biden administration officials would always say is Putin is not serious about [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=390.14s)]
*  negotiating a peace deal. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  Putin wants victory. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=397.86s)]
*  He wants huge gains that the Ukrainians can never accept. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=399.56s)]
*  Now, with the arrival of Trump, who is actually pressing this and very much wants to engineer [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  a deal, he's finally called Putin's bluff in a way that no one else has. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=412.18s)]
*  And Zelensky has very shrewdly created the dynamics for that to happen. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=417.78000000000003s)]
*  So what happens after Trump starts getting angry at Putin? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=424.62s)]
*  By late March, you see some of the first signs of Trump's frustration with Putin. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=430.02s)]
*  In one interview, he says he's very angry and even pissed off at comments Putin has [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=436.26s)]
*  made about Zelensky saying that they're not helping the peace process. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=442.03999999999996s)]
*  And he talks about increasing sanctions on Russia. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=445.86s)]
*  But Putin is undeterred. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=449.44s)]
*  As the weeks go by, he's bombing and striking Ukrainian cities, hitting civilian targets [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=454.52s)]
*  with drones and missiles. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=460.08s)]
*  And there's worldwide outrage that finally even includes President Trump, who on April [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  24th, posts on his Truth Social account, Vladimir, stop. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=469.15999999999997s)]
*  Not necessary and very bad timing in response to a major Russian attack on Kiev. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=475.85999999999996s)]
*  He says, let's get the peace deal done in all capital letters. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=482.0s)]
*  So this is really a kind of a creed of core from Trump. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=486.36s)]
*  You can really sense his frustration. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=490.32s)]
*  You're screwing up my deal here, Vladimir. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=492.84s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=495.14s)]
*  I thought we were friends. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=496.14s)]
*  Am I correct in saying that this is like the strongest language we've ever seen from Trump [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=497.14s)]
*  up until this point? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=501.3s)]
*  You are. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=502.78s)]
*  You are. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=503.78s)]
*  And not only is it the strongest language, but it's such a departure from the way he [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=504.78s)]
*  always talked about Putin, which is to make excuses for him. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=508.02000000000004s)]
*  Or when he's asked about Putin assassinating political opponents, he says, well, lots of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=512.26s)]
*  people do that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=518.7s)]
*  So it's not only that he hasn't directly criticized Putin in this way before, it's that he's contorted [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=520.26s)]
*  himself to find ways to defend and excuse Putin. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=526.66s)]
*  But what happens next in some ways is even more surprising. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  On April 26th, at the funeral for Pope Francis at the Vatican, Trump has his first meeting [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=534.78s)]
*  with Zelensky since the debacle in the Oval Office. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=543.0799999999999s)]
*  And this is sort of an impromptu pull-aside. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=548.54s)]
*  We don't know that much about it, but all the vibes, you might say, were very positive. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=552.3399999999999s)]
*  And the kind of defining aspect of what we know about it is a photograph that was published [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=558.86s)]
*  showing just Trump and Zelensky one-on-one in some large marble hall somewhere in the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=565.14s)]
*  Vatican, sitting in two chairs facing each other, almost with their knees touching, locked [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=573.06s)]
*  in a very intense conversation. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=579.34s)]
*  I remember seeing the photos. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=582.42s)]
*  It was really stunning. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=583.42s)]
*  It was theatrical. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=585.46s)]
*  And you know, you don't want to read too much into one photograph, but this picture of the [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=588.74s)]
*  two of them said so much. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=593.9s)]
*  There was no retinue of staffers around them. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=596.06s)]
*  There was no media. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=599.8s)]
*  And you could tell that they were having a serious conversation and it was not angry. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=601.86s)]
*  It looked intense, but not angry. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=606.62s)]
*  And so, you know, here Trump is willing to sit down with Zelensky one-on-one, grant him [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  that legitimacy. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=615.34s)]
*  And you know, this is seen as a very encouraging sign for Ukrainian supporters, but even more [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=617.02s)]
*  encouraging is the fact that just a few days later on April 30th, the Trump administration [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=623.42s)]
*  inks a deal with Ukraine that gives America access to Ukraine's critical minerals. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=630.22s)]
*  And although some people worry that this is some effort by Trump to rip Ukraine off, Ukrainians [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=637.78s)]
*  are actually supportive of this because they feel that this gives Trump an investment in [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=645.58s)]
*  the future of their country that he did not have before. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=650.94s)]
*  So suddenly Trump is doing deals with the Ukrainians. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=654.58s)]
*  And where is Vladimir Putin? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=658.7800000000001s)]
*  He is still holding out, not making concessions, not doing significant deals. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=660.3800000000001s)]
*  And Trump is losing more and more patience. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=667.3800000000001s)]
*  And something that's ominous for Vladimir Putin is on the same day he sees Zelensky [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=671.62s)]
*  at the Vatican, he again complains about Russian missile strikes into civilian areas of Ukraine [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=678.5799999999999s)]
*  and says that these attacks make him wonder whether Putin actually doesn't want to stop [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=685.5799999999999s)]
*  the war and that he's just, as Trump says it in kind of an odd terminology, just tapping [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=691.0999999999999s)]
*  me along. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=697.62s)]
*  And at this point, Trump decides he needs to talk to Putin. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=700.86s)]
*  And he arranges a call with the Russian leader. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=706.26s)]
*  And all these weeks of gamesmanship, maneuvering and roiling frustration seems to be culminating [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=709.82s)]
*  in this one essential conversation. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=718.6600000000001s)]
*  And to hear Trump tell it, this call with Vladimir Putin could determine whether he [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=724.1s)]
*  is willing to continue trying to mediate an end to this war. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=729.7s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=737.22s)]
*  So Michael, after all of this buildup, all of this anticipation, what actually happened [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=759.22s)]
*  on the call between Putin and Trump? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=763.74s)]
*  So 10am comes on Monday for this highly anticipated call and the two leaders are treating it very [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=765.78s)]
*  differently. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=772.42s)]
*  For Trump, there's been all this fanfare and buildup on social media and his comments to [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=773.5s)]
*  reporters and comments from other administration officials. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=778.98s)]
*  And he does the call from the White House. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=782.5799999999999s)]
*  Putin does the call from a school on the Sochi coast. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=786.18s)]
*  He's not even at the Kremlin. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=793.26s)]
*  He's not even in Moscow. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=794.58s)]
*  He didn't even announce it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=796.22s)]
*  He didn't announce it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=797.22s)]
*  And it, you know, he seems to be kind of squeezing it into his schedule. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=798.34s)]
*  For Putin, this is not the defining event of the week. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=803.62s)]
*  And I think that symbolizes the mismatch in expectations or really a mismatch in substance. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=808.26s)]
*  You saw that in the way both men described this call after the fact. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=822.1400000000001s)]
*  You know, Putin said it was informative and open and that he told Trump he would work [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=826.1s)]
*  on a what he called a memorandum for future peace talks. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=832.34s)]
*  But he didn't agree to a ceasefire of any kind. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=836.22s)]
*  He didn't make any new concessions. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=840.1400000000001s)]
*  He certainly didn't present the call as some breakthrough or new stage of the process. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=843.46s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, everybody. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=851.22s)]
*  Trump's version was a bit more upbeat. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=853.9s)]
*  And he did tell journalists afterward that he is still hopeful for a deal. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=856.98s)]
*  There's a good chance we can get this done. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=862.26s)]
*  I believe Putin wants to do it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=864.34s)]
*  Now, if I thought Putin didn't, I mean, that's what I do. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=865.7s)]
*  My whole life is like deals, one big deal. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=868.1s)]
*  But he clearly puts the onus on Putin. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=871.74s)]
*  I said, when are we going to end this splatter? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=874.3000000000001s)]
*  I've known for a long time now. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=876.5s)]
*  I said, when are we going to add this bloodshed? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=878.9399999999999s)]
*  This bloodbath? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=881.14s)]
*  It's a bloodbath. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  Trump was blaming Putin again for how long this has gone on. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=884.4599999999999s)]
*  And you know, he straight up asked Putin, when is this war going to end? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=889.9399999999999s)]
*  He's clearly frustrated or maybe disappointed that Putin has not changed his position. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=894.5799999999999s)]
*  But it's not particularly angry or threatening. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=902.14s)]
*  Big ego's involved, I tell you. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=906.7s)]
*  Big ego's involved. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=908.98s)]
*  But I think something's going to happen. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=910.1400000000001s)]
*  You get the sense that Trump has reached his own limits. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=912.34s)]
*  And I did say also, if I thought that you couldn't do it, I'd step away because what [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=916.22s)]
*  are you going to do? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=921.34s)]
*  It seems that he's reaching a point where he's ready to just wash his hands of both [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=922.6600000000001s)]
*  of them. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=928.22s)]
*  Again, this was a European situation. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=929.22s)]
*  It should have remained a European situation. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=932.5s)]
*  You know, he says that maybe others could help out, but that it just might not be worth [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=935.22s)]
*  it to try to make this deal. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=939.22s)]
*  And thank you all very much. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=940.9399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=941.9399999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=942.9399999999999s)]
*  Wait, so does that mean that after all this time, after Trump pledging to end the war, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=943.9399999999999s)]
*  after Trump trying to bring these two sides to the table, does that mean that the US is [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=949.1s)]
*  out? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=954.5s)]
*  Like, does that mean that Trump is saying, like, I give up? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=955.5s)]
*  Well, it's always hard to know with Trump. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=957.7s)]
*  That would seem to be the implication. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=960.8199999999999s)]
*  On the other hand, Trump has invested a lot of time and a fair amount of political capital [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=963.24s)]
*  into this process. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=969.48s)]
*  And he's come up completely empty handed. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=971.66s)]
*  So you know, is he really serious? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=976.12s)]
*  Is he really ready to walk away? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=979.72s)]
*  And even if he does, that raises an entirely new set of questions about where he goes from [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=981.9s)]
*  here. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=989.48s)]
*  What would it mean for Ukraine, though, if the United States did just say, okay, we're [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=990.7s)]
*  done with this? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=994.14s)]
*  Like, I'm unclear. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=995.14s)]
*  Are we still giving them weapons? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=997.4200000000001s)]
*  Like, are we still supporting them in some way? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=998.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, the US continues to provide Ukraine with some assistance that was previously approved [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1000.7s)]
*  by Congress under the Biden administration and continues to provide intelligence sharing [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1007.5s)]
*  to Ukraine, which is really, really important because we have such a sophisticated intelligence [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1013.9s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  So this means, among other things, you know, our satellites, which can see Russian positions [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1020.6800000000001s)]
*  and other sources of intelligence we have on Russia's military plans and operations. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1025.52s)]
*  Hugely important to Ukraine. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  The question is, what will happen a few weeks and months from now if Trump decides he wants [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1033.14s)]
*  to wash his hands of these negotiations? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1040.06s)]
*  Would he cut off the intelligence assistance? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1043.96s)]
*  Will he, in his budget request to Congress, ask for more support for Ukraine, either military [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1048.18s)]
*  or economic? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1056.92s)]
*  And if not, to what degree could Europe fill the gap? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1058.66s)]
*  You know, most analysts say that Europe can do a fair amount, but not enough to prevent [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1063.04s)]
*  Ukraine's position from being severely weakened over time. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1069.6000000000001s)]
*  This, by the way, is exactly why many people believe this is what Putin has wanted all [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1073.7s)]
*  along. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1079.74s)]
*  For Trump to grow impatient, to give up, to walk away, and that gives Russia a major military [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1080.74s)]
*  advantage and Putin can just take what he wants eventually. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1088.98s)]
*  How should we think about the way that Trump relates to other superpower rivals at this [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1094.42s)]
*  stage in his second term? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1099.04s)]
*  Like how he both tries to make deals with them, but also how he tries to pressure them. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1100.3799999999999s)]
*  Look, I think that every world leader is watching this process and trying to figure out how [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1105.62s)]
*  Trump operates. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1112.8999999999999s)]
*  But I think that this Ukraine saga has reinforced some constants with Donald Trump that world [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1114.24s)]
*  leaders will be paying very close attention to. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1120.74s)]
*  One of them is that what animates Trump possibly more than anything else is the desire to cut [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1124.2s)]
*  a deal. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1131.28s)]
*  And sometimes it may not even be a very real deal. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  It may be something that he's able to call a great deal that doesn't have a lot of substance [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1137.28s)]
*  to it. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1141.5s)]
*  And so you've seen both Zelensky and Putin play to that. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1142.68s)]
*  I also think that this shows that Trump can be a very intimidating bully, particularly [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1147.66s)]
*  on social media or in press conferences with reporters. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1155.14s)]
*  But what happened when he was face to face or on the phone with those guys? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1159.5800000000002s)]
*  He didn't threaten them. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1163.8600000000001s)]
*  He didn't bluster and bully by any account. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1164.8600000000001s)]
*  And I think what that tells you is that Trump says a lot of things for public consumption. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1167.8600000000001s)]
*  He likes to posture a lot and talk tough. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1173.18s)]
*  But ultimately, and particularly if it's in the service of cutting a deal, it doesn't [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1177.24s)]
*  mean that that's where his head is really at or that he's going to let those resentments [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1182.5600000000002s)]
*  get in the way of what he perceives to be his tactical interest at any given moment. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1186.28s)]
*  I just sort of wonder if this whole saga so far, Trump going from optimism to anger to [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1193.0s)]
*  maybe apathy with some other motions in between with no change in outcome. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1200.56s)]
*  Putin has remained the same in what he wants this entire time. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1205.84s)]
*  And so I just sort of wonder if this whole evolution has just showed us that Trump is [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1209.76s)]
*  learning that he cannot pressure or sweet talk or make a deal out of this problem. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1213.6399999999999s)]
*  Like what people said about the stock market, right? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1220.46s)]
*  He cannot bully the stock market into giving what he wants, and he cannot pressure Putin [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1222.5s)]
*  into giving him what he wants. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1226.28s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1228.1399999999999s)]
*  Now I've heard people say that Trump came into this second term riding higher, feeling [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1229.6s)]
*  stronger. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1236.56s)]
*  He had been around the block once before as president, and he may have thought he could [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1238.4399999999998s)]
*  come in and get things done really fast in a way that he couldn't do in his first term. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1243.04s)]
*  But the world is a really complicated, difficult place. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1248.52s)]
*  And dealing with Vladimir Putin, any experienced diplomat will tell you is one of the great [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1253.82s)]
*  challenges in foreign affairs. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1259.62s)]
*  And I'm sometimes reminded of a saying that is attributed to the Taliban in Afghanistan, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1265.06s)]
*  when the US spent 20 years trying to outfight the Taliban and defeat them. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1270.26s)]
*  And the saying was, you have the watches, but we have the time. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1275.6999999999998s)]
*  And the idea behind that was you may be more technologically sophisticated, more advanced, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1281.9399999999998s)]
*  more powerful, but we can just wait you out. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1286.94s)]
*  We're here and we're not going anywhere. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1291.3s)]
*  And I think that, you know, that partly explains how Vladimir Putin sees this. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1294.5800000000002s)]
*  He's got to get through this sort of quaint little adventure of the American president [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1300.42s)]
*  who wants a nice deal, but he's playing a much longer game. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1305.94s)]
*  And he may have calculated that Trump will get frustrated and storm off. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1310.14s)]
*  And at the moment, it looks like that might be exactly what's happening. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1314.38s)]
*  Michael, thank you so much. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1324.5400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1326.22s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1334.8600000000001s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1341.9s)]
*  On Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston said that the Trump administration apparently had [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1343.9s)]
*  violated an order he issued by flying a Burmese immigrant to South Sudan without first giving [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1348.8600000000001s)]
*  him enough time to challenge his removal. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1354.22s)]
*  Judge Brian Murphy ordered a government lawyer to find out exactly where the plane was and [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1357.3000000000002s)]
*  whether it could be turned around mid-flight. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1361.98s)]
*  He also warned that everyone involved in the flight could face criminal contempt sanctions. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1364.7s)]
*  Lawyers for the Burmese migrant said that a man from Vietnam was also deported on the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1370.42s)]
*  same plane, a claim that the Justice Department lawyers would not confirm. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1374.1000000000001s)]
*  And it was not clear how many other migrants were on the plane or what their home countries [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1378.18s)]
*  were. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1383.18s)]
*  The judge's original ruling from April ordered the administration not to deport migrants [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1384.6200000000001s)]
*  to countries other than their own without first giving them 15 days notice to raise [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1389.9s)]
*  concerns. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1394.42s)]
*  Canada, Britain, and France have sharply condemned Israel for its proposed plans to escalate [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1397.3s)]
*  the war in Gaza, calling them, quote, disproportionate and egregious. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1402.06s)]
*  The joint statement follows a threat from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1407.3s)]
*  to take control of Gaza at a time when the United Nations is warning that the population [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqH32wvsPZI&t=1411.4199999999998s)]
