# Chaos or Conscience? A Republican Explains His Vote to Oust McCarthy.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhHsUmzDFUQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a Daily.
*  The ouster of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a few days ago has demonstrated just how powerful
*  a small group of hard-right House Republicans have become, just how far they will go in
*  the name of ideology, and just how deep their grievances run.
*  Today, a conversation with one of the eight Republicans who brought McCarthy down, Congressman
*  Tim Burchett of Tennessee.
*  It's Friday, October 6th.
*  Congressman?
*  Congressman?
*  Congressman?
*  Oh, Congressman, you are muted on your side of this.
*  Oh, wait, let me take that off.
*  There we go.
*  Can y'all hear me?
*  I can.
*  Hello, Congressman.
*  Hey, it's Tim.
*  I don't believe I'm allowed to call you anything other than Congressman.
*  You can call me Tim, dude, don't you?
*  And so I tell the custodians, all the custodians up here call me Tim, because they are the
*  only ones up here working.
*  I believe you're working today.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Talking to you guys.
*  So I really want to thank you for making time for us.
*  Yes, sir.
*  It is, I think, no understatement to say, been a heck of a week in your world.
*  It's a heck of a day, heck of a day.
*  And I had to make a tough decision and I made it.
*  It makes me wonder, are people in the Republican caucus in the House, are they talking to you
*  right now or are you something of a pariah?
*  I've always been something of a pariah, brother.
*  I didn't come to Washington to make friends.
*  Well, as I think we're hinting at here, you're one of the eight House Republicans who made
*  a very momentous decision.
*  And that decision was to vote to oust your leader, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
*  First time that has happened in United States history.
*  And I wonder how much that history, Congressman, weighed on you in the period leading up to
*  the actual vote.
*  I tell you what weighed on me is just doing the right thing.
*  If I could, can I go over my thought process to where I got to where I voted for that?
*  Would that be okay?
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess I want to make sure people understand what a journey it's been
*  for you because you started off as a firm supporter of Speaker McCarthy.
*  You were somebody who voted for him.
*  15 times.
*  15 times during that now agonizing process.
*  And you weren't one of those conservative House Republicans who refused or said, I'm
*  going to vote present.
*  You were a formal definitive yes over and over again back in January.
*  And yes, the reason I do want you to explain your thinking and your journey is that I think
*  if we can understand your disillusionment with Speaker McCarthy over these last nine
*  months, we can better understand the larger story of what has happened here.
*  So tell us how you got from there supporting McCarthy to here deciding he could no longer
*  be speaker.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Well, during that time, if you've seen a lot of the pictures, I sat beside a lot of the
*  holdouts and I met with them because I was you know, I'm a conservative.
*  I'm just not angry about it.
*  And I met with them several times during that.
*  And I talked to them about things I thought were important.
*  And they agreed.
*  And I went to Speaker McCarthy early on and I said, these are some things I wanted.
*  And he gave me about assurance about 85% of what I was interested in would happen.
*  I wanted a fiscal note.
*  I wanted something to say how much something cost.
*  I remembered one time I asked him, then our ranking member, now our chair of appropriations,
*  just how much money does this this piece of legislation cost?
*  And she looked at me said, I don't know.
*  Next question.
*  I said, no.
*  You know, and later, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  You can't question her.
*  You can't do that.
*  You know, and then I never did find out how much that piece of legislation cost.
*  So that was something I asked the speaker about it.
*  And they said they would use that.
*  You said I should be able to know exactly what the price tag is on a piece of legislation.
*  That was one of your conditions.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I don't think that's unusual at all.
*  I don't walk into the supermarket and just trust the cashier to, you know, to charge
*  me whatever they think it costs.
*  Can you just explain why these questions around fiscal transparency, why they're so important
*  to you and why they seem to be your primary overriding concern as a member of Congress
*  and why you think they're so important for the people you represent in Tennessee?
*  I had the very good fortune of having parents that were a good deal older than most of my
*  buddies parents.
*  My brother and sister and I were both, all three of us born very late in their lives.
*  And my parents grew up in the Depression.
*  And daddy told me a story one time, and I always remembered it.
*  He said he watched these kids and they were laughing.
*  And he said, hey, watch this.
*  And they ate an apple and they threw the apple core in the trash can.
*  And some kid came by and dug through the trash and ate that apple core.
*  And as a young man, that made a huge impression on my daddy.
*  This child's need and perhaps poverty.
*  And poverty and because of irresponsibility and greed and things like that.
*  America was thrust into a depression.
*  I think about that and I think about the average American, you know, you got single moms in
*  my district working two jobs, got three kids.
*  And we are just throwing money away on all this stuff overseas everywhere and not focusing
*  on keeping our debt down and keeping inflation down.
*  So I just want to make sure it sounds like you're saying that the reason you care about
*  And the reason you believe your constituents care about it is a fear that government mismanagement
*  of our nation's finances could lead to just a truly awful outcome, whether it's something
*  like the Great Depression of 1929 or just kind of garden variety problems in people's
*  financial lives.
*  Not could, but 100% will.
*  Because nowadays this world depends more on America's economy and it would be a worldwide
*  depression.
*  It would be a complete devaluation of currency.
*  Inflation will be rampant.
*  It'd be like, you know, pre World War II Europe where you see the people pushing the wheelbarrow
*  down the street full of cash trying to buy a loaf of bread.
*  I mean, you surely know this, right?
*  There's a lot of debate about the causes of any one financial crisis.
*  1929 wasn't necessarily about government spending, but you seem quite convinced that too much
*  government spending and not enough accountability around that spending, not enough transparency
*  around it is a problem.
*  100%.
*  We are out of control and we have no fiscal barometer at all.
*  What did you just kind of brass tacks?
*  This speaker that you voted for in January to be able to do about that, knowing as you
*  do that Republicans had such a slim majority and that the next chamber, the Senate, is
*  controlled by Democrats and the White House is controlled by a Democrat.
*  What did you reasonably expect, given what he told you, but given what's also possible,
*  that he could do about these questions of transparency and spending?
*  I expected leadership.
*  I expected somebody to take our ideas and our values to the White House, to the Senate,
*  and say, let's meet, let's talk about it.
*  But you're not going to get that way by issuing a press release.
*  I'm not going to meet with the President.
*  I'm not going to meet with Chuck Schumer.
*  So you were disappointed when he was not engaging in more vigorous negotiations with the Senate
*  leader or the President.
*  That was, to you, a dereliction.
*  Completely.
*  But there again, we got a real problem in this country and we better start addressing
*  it.
*  That's why I reach out.
*  I'm friends, Josh Gottenheimer from Jersey.
*  I work with those folks.
*  I talk to them about issues, things we're doing.
*  Democrats.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Honestly, dude, we got a dead-gum country to run, man.
*  This is ridiculous.
*  Maybe it sells memberships demonizing the other party or demonizing somebody, but the
*  reality is we need to produce and get to work.
*  I want to keep pushing on this because there is a point at which Speaker McCarthy does
*  sit down and negotiate with Democrats and with the President.
*  And it feels like when he does, and it's around these issues, there are always moments where
*  spending is on the table, you lose faith in Speaker McCarthy.
*  And so I want to talk about those moments and let's start with the debt ceiling.
*  Well, we continue to raise the debt ceiling every year.
*  And you can argue, well, that's just a grand to pay what we owed.
*  And to me, that just sets yourself up for more economic failure, more spending.
*  Well, what did you want Speaker McCarthy to do in that negotiation?
*  Reduce the debt ceiling, take our views and our values to the table.
*  And they did not.
*  Do you believe that Speaker McCarthy never brought your perspective to the negotiation
*  table or just ultimately couldn't prevail in getting enough folks to support it?
*  I just want to understand that distinction.
*  I don't know.
*  I just know that my views weren't being represented and whoever had his ear, they were.
*  I remembered I had a meeting with his lieutenant because I was a holdout and the press was
*  like, you still know?
*  Yep.
*  I'm going to meet with them, though.
*  Great.
*  A couple of days before the vote, they set up a meeting.
*  I go to this meeting and I wait and I wait and I wait.
*  I waited 20 or 30 minutes and they didn't show up.
*  No meeting.
*  The press is waiting for me outside to hear and I walk out and it was very embarrassing
*  to me.
*  Huh.
*  You were you were basically kind of dissed.
*  Disrespected and I get that.
*  I'm the 435th most powerful member of Congress and there's only 435 of us.
*  That's my number on the baseball team, by the way.
*  And then you start with the process.
*  You know how great I am.
*  They really need me, need me on board.
*  I need you to help me.
*  And I said, no, I'm not.
*  I'm not.
*  And then they go to belittling.
*  If they thought they're just going to roll me and that's not taking me to the woodshed.
*  It's not going to work.
*  I don't care.
*  I just said, I'm not with you.
*  And I walked out and that was it.
*  I'm going to vote my conscience.
*  And that's what I did.
*  We're going to continue down this path of runaway spending until we call it in the check.
*  And we repeatedly refused to do that.
*  Well, you started to get at this.
*  You voted against that deal, a deal that won many more Democratic votes than Republican
*  to avert a U.S. government default by raising the debt ceiling back in the summer.
*  And I'm hearing you say that a default wouldn't be catastrophic.
*  To many others, the analysis was that it was going to be catastrophic.
*  So I just want to be sure I understand.
*  It's always catastrophic when you're in the opposition always makes it catastrophic.
*  And so we'll never get our fiscal ship in order.
*  We're never going to get it straightened out.
*  And we just continue down this path of spending.
*  And I'm not going to be a part of it.
*  Was there a part of you that in any way wanted to see, and I don't want this phrasing to
*  get too loaded, but wanted a situation to arise where perhaps the country did go into
*  a potential default because it would then allow you to make this question of fiscal
*  responsibility, spending cuts, transparency more pressing and prominent to people that
*  was going to give you and those like minded more leverage?
*  You mean what I've tried to cause it to prove my point?
*  Yeah.
*  That is what I'm asking.
*  No, no, I wouldn't do that.
*  That's a gutless thing to do.
*  I just vote my conscience.
*  I didn't do my votes on fiscal issues did not put us in this position.
*  Yet I'm required to fall on my sword to correct it when it will never correct if we just keep
*  spending.
*  You know, it's the chicken or the egg.
*  So this addiction needs to be broken regardless.
*  Somebody is going to have to take tough stands.
*  Somebody's got to draw attention to it.
*  Yet nobody is.
*  But in the end, Congressman, the deal that McCarthy signed around the debt limit ends
*  up being a deal that you don't like because you and a few other conservative House Republicans
*  won't sign on to it.
*  Therefore he feels he has no choice but to work with Democrats to get a deal that by
*  definition you're going to like even less than the one you were negotiating before.
*  I know where you're headed with that.
*  And I actually asked leadership, as I've done every time, to get the people that are opposed
*  to it in a room and let's talk about it.
*  And they never do.
*  They want to jam us up against a wall and make us look bad in the public's eye and thinking
*  we'll yield.
*  And to me, that just creates animosity.
*  You know, everybody up here, they fuss at you and cuss at you and drop f-bombs on you
*  and say things when you walk by.
*  Do they?
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, you got bullies in there that get in your face.
*  They act real tough.
*  I always like to say they're the type of guy that when they were a kid threw a rock over
*  the fence and then ran home and hid behind their mama's skirt because when leadership
*  doesn't call them down, they are endorsing that type of behavior.
*  And so to me, that does not show leadership.
*  That shows cowardice and it's very childish behavior.
*  And I don't like that type of leadership.
*  I would like for them to get with us in the beginning and let's work our differences out.
*  But they chose not to do that.
*  Yeah, I'm hearing you say you're feeling marginalized, which is kind of interesting because you all,
*  there aren't that many of you, everyone understands the power of your block of votes, whether
*  it's the five or eight or 10 or 15 of you who can be so influential in this moment.
*  And I'm hearing you say that you guys are not being drawn into the process in a way
*  that makes you feel respected by Speaker McCarthy.
*  You're not being drawn in the process at all until the end.
*  And then they say we're not willing to work with them.
*  Do you think that Speaker McCarthy concluded somewhere along the way that it's just kind
*  of futile to do that because he knows what you all stand for, because he knows the terms
*  upon which you want to negotiate?
*  Well, that's hard to say because we never did meet with us.
*  I think this brings us, if we're kind of sticking with the chronology here, to this second
*  big moment that I believe upset you and tested your faith in Speaker McCarthy, which is
*  the potential government shutdown last week.
*  And the dynamics there were very much the same as they were with the debt ceiling and
*  the potential default on U.S. debt.
*  You did not like the deal that was being offered within the Republican caucus, which then prompted
*  McCarthy to work with Democrats to pass a spending bill that would prevent the government
*  from shutting down.
*  Does that feel like an accurate description?
*  No.
*  Well, we were not offered the opportunity to work with Speaker McCarthy.
*  Again.
*  Again.
*  But once again, I think to the lay listener, it may sound a little bit like you're so frustrated
*  at being sidelined that you're willing to let the government shut down.
*  Well, I'm worried about the pain that that would cause.
*  And I say this with all sincerity.
*  But I tell you what I'm more worried about is the inflation and the lack of purchase
*  power that these people are going to get.
*  The single moms and the teachers and people that bust their hump every day, firemen, policemen.
*  As a result of what?
*  Of government spending?
*  Government spending and our economy crashing.
*  It's just when you take in five trillion dollars a year and you spend seven trillion, eventually
*  you got to realize that that's deflating the value of American currency.
*  There's no other way around it.
*  I just want to be sure.
*  I just kicked.
*  I'm making sure to clarify these things.
*  A government shutdown, like a default, has consequences.
*  Those consequences are soldiers aren't paid, law enforcement, federal law enforcement.
*  But you're saying it's more.
*  No, they will all get paid.
*  They will all be reimbursed as they always are.
*  And they do a lot of this to scare people.
*  Both parties do it.
*  Block up the monuments so the veterans can't get to them.
*  Things that are going to cause maximum pain and maximum exposure.
*  But if we enter into a depression, I dare say those people, there's the good faith and
*  will of this country are not going to be able to take care of these people.
*  You're saying something that I think is important to understand, which is that as with a potential
*  default, a potential government shutdown is not going to cause the big trauma.
*  In your mind, the big economic financial trauma is not changing government spending patterns
*  in your parlance addiction, which creates the real long term economic hardships.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Because we're not doing it.
*  It's institutional and we're not doing anything to fix it.
*  And all the stuff we're doing now is just making it worse.
*  I do see a bit of a pattern here and I want to run it by you and get your read on it.
*  It feels like this is what's happening in both of these cases of the default and the
*  potential shutdown.
*  That you and some of your colleagues, by being, maybe you would present this word obstinate,
*  unyielding, whatever it is, you force the government into a tricky position.
*  I know you don't think that those positions are as traumatic as other people do, but obviously
*  Speaker McCarthy did.
*  And he worries so much that he feels he has no choice but to work with the Democrats to
*  prevent those crises.
*  Here's my really important question.
*  In a sense, haven't you engineered the entire situation by being so unwilling to take anything
*  less than what you want?
*  Speaker McCarthy, his major concern is staying in power.
*  We had a conversation a few weeks ago and on Saturday, the last thing he said to me
*  was, I really want to be the speaker.
*  To me, that that simplified pretty much everything.
*  What do we got that will get the votes?
*  Not what are we principled?
*  What are we going to fight for?
*  And that to me is not leadership.
*  That is just a barometer.
*  You stick your finger up in the air, figure out which of the winds blowing, and then you
*  jump out in front of it and take credit for it.
*  That is not leadership.
*  That is nothing to rally around.
*  And the differences between him and Pelosi, and I catch a lot of hell for saying this,
*  but she was an effective leader.
*  And she would get an issue, put a stake in the ground and call people in and say, this
*  is where I'm at, where are you?
*  And then when she put her proposal out, it would win.
*  And that was because of that style of leadership.
*  And that is something we're not doing.
*  But we know that Speaker McCarthy was willing to give up this job he loved in the end because
*  he did.
*  And so I do want to ask this question again.
*  He didn't have any choice.
*  I mean, he was gone.
*  There was no...
*  But just hear me out on this.
*  In the end, in these scenarios, is it accurate or not that you and a few of your colleagues,
*  given your crucial role, given the numbers, engineer these situations that end with the
*  speaker feeling like his only choice is to work with Democrats?
*  No, I hear what you're saying and I hear that a lot.
*  But I think his problem was his refusal to work with his own members.
*  He just didn't meet with us.
*  Fifteen of us, get us in a room, find out the differences.
*  I think that would have been a wise approach.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So for all these reasons that you've clearly described, you have lost your faith in Speaker
*  McCarthy by the beginning of this week.
*  And then your colleague, Representative Matt Gaetz, files this motion to try to remove
*  him as speaker.
*  I'm curious, did you end up speaking to McCarthy before that vote and did he appeal to you
*  in any way that let you air out all these grievances and all these feelings of being
*  slighted and not heard out?
*  Did you guys talk about it?
*  Well, he called me.
*  I was on CNN.
*  I think I'm one of the few Republicans that goes on CNN on a regular basis.
*  And I said, I prayed about it and I asked God to show me what I needed to be doing.
*  And he called me that morning and his opening salvo to me, I felt, was very condescending.
*  What did he say?
*  Well, just mentioned something about my prayer.
*  And then he since come back and said he didn't say it.
*  That's not the way he meant it or whatever, but it doesn't matter.
*  You were not pleased with the way he framed your prayers.
*  Yeah.
*  So he follows up.
*  I said something I think about term limits and where are we on term limits?
*  Can I just make sure I understand that term limits are important to you?
*  Term limits are important to me, but they're important to the American public.
*  It pulls through the roof.
*  And he said, well, it died in committee.
*  And then I said, we took six weeks off.
*  We usually just take the month of August off.
*  When we took off two weeks in September, I said, why'd you all send us home?
*  I don't set the schedule.
*  You know, Dad Gummett, he's speaker.
*  You think if Pelosi wanted us to be here over the weekend, we'd be over the weekend?
*  I dare say we would.
*  So this is another, in your mind, failure of leadership.
*  Complete.
*  He is the speaker of the House.
*  One of the most powerful positions, not in Washington, not in the country, but in the
*  Dad Gumm world.
*  To say that he can't set anything to the schedule, he doesn't get bills in committee to me is
*  not acceptable.
*  And so I wasn't getting anywhere.
*  And that was it.
*  And I thought God was telling me, maybe not in an audible voice, but in my gut or my
*  conscience, he was saying, vote your conscience, because that's what served me very well
*  these last few years that I've been in office.
*  And that's the way I voted.
*  And I voted that way.
*  I wonder, Congressman, if you think the other seven who voted the same way you did had
*  similar reasons and similar experiences with the speaker.
*  I think style of leadership is a big thing.
*  I think fiscal responsibility is a big thing.
*  And we just had enough.
*  We just had enough.
*  And so it was time to make a stand, and we did.
*  I want to take you back to the moments after Speaker McCarthy was ousted.
*  He gave a news conference.
*  I don't know how much of it you watched.
*  I watched all of it.
*  And he basically said that in his mind, the eight of you who voted to oust him have now
*  created an impossible situation for the next speaker.
*  And when he said before that there needs to be an adult in the room, I think he meant
*  something very particular about the ability to keep government open, avoid a default,
*  negotiate, and sometimes reach deals that are not the best, but they're good enough.
*  What did you hear him say when he said that?
*  I didn't listen to it.
*  But from what you said, I would assume that, you know, the adult in the room is going to
*  be somebody that tells the truth, doesn't pit people against others.
*  And that's not what we have.
*  I took it to mean that in Congress and in divided government, you have to compromise.
*  I don't compromise my values.
*  If I gave my word, I give my word.
*  I don't represent the lobbyist up here.
*  I represent a lot of hardworking folks back in East Tennessee.
*  And, you know, and to them, I'm their hope, I think.
*  And that's why I keep getting elected and the big boys just fail to understand that.
*  Can you describe for me, Congressman, what you want in the next speaker?
*  Because there is a sense you've made clear that Speaker McCarthy told a lot of different
*  people what they wanted to hear and then didn't live up to those commitments.
*  And that makes me wonder if you'd support a candidate for speaker who said to you,
*  Congressman Burchard, let me be straight with you.
*  I can't do the things that you want in this area and this area and this year.
*  I know they're important, but I can't do them given the math of this Congress.
*  So just know that upfront.
*  Will you support me anyway?
*  If somebody's straight up with me, I can handle that a lot easier.
*  I want a strong leader, though.
*  When Daddy was in the Pacific, his colonel on a little island called
*  Pell Lou was a guy named Chesty Pullard.
*  But Daddy, you know, he said they'd turn around on Pell Lou
*  and, hell, there'd be Colonel Pullard right there with him, fighting it out.
*  That's the kind of leader I look for.
*  I look for somebody like a Colonel Pullard, like my father,
*  who'd get in the trenches with you and who would meet with you,
*  not set up some appointment that you got to go to the Capitol and you wait outside
*  and you wait and you wait and you wait.
*  And if there's some compromise involved in that, then maybe.
*  So integrity is the question at hand?
*  I think so.
*  I think so.
*  I think that because of the vote you cast, the next few weeks are going to be very confusing
*  and uncertain in Washington.
*  For all kinds of procedural reasons, the House is going to not be able to do certain things
*  because there's not a speaker, including passing spending bills.
*  Does that bother you?
*  We'll be back to work Tuesday and we will elect a speaker on Wednesday.
*  I'm confident we'll have one ballot on the floor and I believe that will pass.
*  So this is not a moment you're worried is going to drag out for some time?
*  I don't think it will.
*  Just to end this conversation, Congressman, let's say this new speaker who you are amenable
*  to and who has the integrity you need for him or her to possess gets the job.
*  There's still a mathematical problem at the heart of what you and this small group of
*  Republicans represent.
*  You want something that many other of your colleagues don't want and many Democrats
*  don't want.
*  And so let's say you get that speaker, the one you like.
*  Are you truly going to be willing to compromise on some of these questions we've been talking
*  about so that you're not right back where we were at the beginning of this conversation?
*  If I feel like that speaker worked with me in good faith.
*  Then you'll compromise.
*  It depends.
*  On spending, on fiscal matters.
*  It depends.
*  I'm not going to do deficit spending.
*  There's no compromise there.
*  There is no compromise there.
*  There is no more money.
*  You can't spend money you don't have.
*  We can't just keep printing money.
*  So that does mean we might be back where we started.
*  If we're not going to be fiscally responsible.
*  But I think this next speaker will understand that role.
*  And if they don't, will you vote again to potentially oust another speaker?
*  I vote my conscience.
*  I don't think we're going to make that mistake again.
*  Well, Congressman Burchett.
*  Thank you very much.
*  We appreciate your time.
*  It's been a pleasure, brother.
*  Thank you.
*  Fair questions.
*  It's been a pleasure for me as well, brother.
*  Thank you.
*  After we spoke with Congressman Burchett, we reached out to the office of former
*  Speaker McCarthy for comment.
*  There was no response.
*  So far, at least two House Republicans say they will seek to replace McCarthy as Speaker.
*  Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House Republican majority leader,
*  and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, an outspoken ally of former President Trump.
*  House Republicans are expected to pick their next leader as early as Wednesday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, a federal court ordered Alabama to use a new congressional map for next year's election
*  that could lead the state to elect two black representatives for the first time in its history
*  and allow Democrats to pick up another House seat in what is expected to be a closely fought
*  battle for control of Congress.
*  The order is the culmination of a two-year fight
*  over an effort by Alabama's Republican lawmakers to dilute the power of black voters
*  in order to consolidate Republican power.
*  That effort has been deemed illegal by several federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.
*  In northeastern Ukraine, dozens of people were killed when a Russian rocket hit a village shop
*  where people had gathered for a funeral.
*  It appeared to be one of the deadliest attacks on civilians since the war began.
*  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate act of terrorism
*  and a quote, demonstrably brutal Russian crime.
*  Today's episode was produced by Astah Chaturvedi, Olivia Nat and Summer Tamad,

*  Klinkenberg, contains original music by Marion Lozano and Will Reed, and was engineered by

*  See you on Monday.
