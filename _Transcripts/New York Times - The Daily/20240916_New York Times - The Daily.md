# Three Undecided Voters, Two Swing States, One Big Decision
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2cj-glZTc4)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Before we get started, a few details about a major developing story that's still being
*  pieced together.
*  The FBI is investigating what appears to be another attempted assassination of former
*  President Trump, this time as he played golf at one of his clubs in West Palm Beach on
*  Sunday afternoon.
*  Trump who was unharmed in the incident was golfing at around 1.30 p.m. when, according
*  to law enforcement, Secret Service agents spotted an armed man hiding in the bushes
*  surrounding the golf course.
*  Agents then fired at the man, who fled the scene in a car but was later apprehended on
*  a nearby highway.
*  It was not immediately clear if the suspect had fired any shots.
*  Police said they found a rifle with a scope near where the man was spotted, along with
*  a camera and two backpacks.
*  A law enforcement official identified the suspect as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh
*  of Hawaii.
*  Last year, Routh told the Times that he had recently traveled to Ukraine as a volunteer
*  fighter in the country's war against Russia.
*  These are the key facts that we know for now.
*  We'll be following developments over the next few hours and we'll bring them to you
*  as soon as we can.
*  OK, here's today's show.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  As everyone saw two nights ago, we had a monumental victory over comrade Kamala Harris in the
*  presidential debate.
*  From the moment that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris walked off the debate stage last week.
*  You saw a president for all America and Kamala Harris.
*  You saw the confidence, you saw the vision, you saw the poise.
*  Both their campaigns and the wider political world have argued over who won during their
*  showdown.
*  What was her take on the debate, Michael?
*  She spanked that ass.
*  Her whole strategy was to distract by mocking Donald Trump so she didn't have to talk about
*  her record or her policies.
*  Whoever did debate prep for Donald Trump should be fired.
*  But the real question is what their first and perhaps only debate meant to a small sliver
*  of undecided voters and a handful of key swing states whose ballots could determine the
*  outcome of the election.
*  Today my colleagues Campbell Robertson and Stella Tan speak to three such voters about
*  what they saw during the debate and how much closer it's brought them to a decision.
*  It's Monday, September 16th.
*  Campbell, tell us about Bob and Sharon Reed and where they fit into this group of undecided
*  American voters at this pretty late moment in the presidential race.
*  So before I get to the Reeds, to step back, the undecided vote at this stage of the race
*  is pretty small.
*  When I say small, I mean about 10% of voters told us in Times polling that they're genuinely
*  uncertain about whether they'll be voting for Trump or Harris.
*  Some say it's even smaller, like 5%.
*  Either way, it's not that many people.
*  But in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, they punch way above their weight because
*  these states are so important and the margins are so narrow that how these voters make up
*  their mind could swing the whole race.
*  They're a pretty diverse group.
*  They're older voters, younger voters, voters of color, white voters.
*  They tend to be, by definition, pretty moderate on the issues.
*  A lot of undecided voters, when you really start talking to them, you'll pick up pretty
*  quickly that they're really actually not that undecided.
*  They might really know who they're going to vote for.
*  They're just waiting to get the convincing case or they're just not plugged in at all.
*  But Bob and Sharon Reed are truly undecided.
*  I've been tracking them for months now as part of a project that the national desk at
*  the Times has undertaken to hear from undecided voters.
*  And at every stage of the race, the Reeds have not been ready to say who they will vote
*  for at all.
*  They have serious reservations about both Trump, first Biden, and now Harris.
*  So just describe the Reeds for us, what we need to know about them to understand how
*  it is that they remain undecided.
*  So the Reeds are a lovely couple.
*  They are both retired school teachers.
*  I had 35.6 at high school, but then I taught 15 or 17 years of college.
*  She taught math.
*  And I taught 32 years in the public school.
*  And then I did 17 years at the college.
*  She taught special education.
*  They live on a small farm.
*  Corn, hay, and alfalfa.
*  Just say hay.
*  Just say hay.
*  In north central Pennsylvania, the single most important swing state in the country.
*  They retired from school teaching a few years ago, so they're living on their pensions.
*  And they said that inflation has hit them hard.
*  Their fixed income has not kept up with inflation.
*  So that is on their mind.
*  And what would you describe their political leanings and past voting as being like?
*  Have y'all always at the presidential level voted Republican?
*  Most times, yeah.
*  Yes.
*  They are Republicans.
*  In presidential elections, they have voted Republican pretty faithfully.
*  They voted for Trump in 2016.
*  They voted for him in 2020.
*  But particularly, Sharon really thinks he's gone downhill since 2020.
*  They think of him as unpredictable.
*  Even when he talks about policies they like, they don't think he'll carry him out.
*  So I mean, is he going to spend time going after?
*  Vindictive.
*  Is he going to be vindictive and go after his, quote, enemies or people that's done
*  him wrong?
*  That worries me.
*  In this year's Republican primary, she was so fed up with Trump that she voted for Nikki
*  Haley.
*  Bob grudgingly voted for Trump.
*  But they've both told me they are totally open to voting for a Democrat, even though
*  they are Republicans and they prefer Republican policies.
*  They voted for Josh Shapiro for governor, the moderate Democratic governor of Pennsylvania.
*  And they like him so much that Sharon was a little worried he'd get picked as Harris's
*  running mate and he'd have to leave Pennsylvania.
*  So how do they think about this presidential debate heading into it last week?
*  So given all their concerns about Trump, they really hoped that Harris was going to make
*  it easy for them in the debate.
*  She would give a plan, she would give specifics.
*  And even if they didn't agree with all of it, there would be enough of it that they
*  agreed with that they could look at each other and say, you know what, we're just going to
*  vote for Harris.
*  So they watched it very closely.
*  And the minute it was over, I gave them a call.
*  First of all, Bob, how was your birthday?
*  Oh, good.
*  I went swimming up in cannibals and we went to Texas Roadhouse and went to see the movie
*  Reagan.
*  I liked it.
*  I thought it was good.
*  It was fair.
*  It's Dennis Quaid, right?
*  And as soon as we started talking about the debate, it was clear that the Reeds didn't
*  get what they wanted out of it.
*  I think she tried a couple of times to say, I want to do this and I want to do that.
*  And that's nice promises.
*  I hope she can get them through Congress.
*  But you know, overall, I think they were still swiping at each other a lot.
*  They really didn't think either candidate delivered a plan that met them where they
*  are.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, I thought Harris would come out with all these programs and I would like like three
*  quarters of them or something like that.
*  And I thought maybe Trump would lay out some economic plans, but they didn't seem to come
*  out with any Trump just seemed to attack and attack.
*  And Harris was trying to say, I'm the stable person in the room.
*  Well, what did either of them make of some of the specific economic policies that both
*  candidates talk about?
*  Because they did talk about a few specific policies.
*  Well, Trump talked about tariffs and stuff.
*  I sort of didn't like that because you put tariffs on we all pay more.
*  Bob thought, well, this is just going to make everything more expensive.
*  So he wrote that off.
*  Now, Harris mentioned her policies and she mentioned three in particular, which were
*  tax credits for home buyers, for people having children and for people starting businesses.
*  Doesn't help us.
*  And both of the reads were like, well, that's not going to help us.
*  Help me.
*  I'm not a first time home buyer.
*  You know, I'm not going to be bearing any children.
*  You know, none of that's going to help me at all.
*  They're in their 70s, they're on a fixed income and inflation is hurting them.
*  And they didn't hear anything from her that would address those concerns specifically.
*  How are you going to deal with rising costs?
*  How are you going to deal with that?
*  And I didn't hear any answers from either one of them.
*  So basically, they're hearing a bunch of, from Harris in particular, specific policies
*  that are aimed at much younger people in the economy, just starting off in their kind
*  of adult economic lives.
*  And that's just not them.
*  So basically, they're not hearing anything for themselves.
*  She didn't say what she would do.
*  And he was just slamming the Biden administration for letting them in.
*  While the economy is their number one priority, they've both brought up immigration as an
*  issue that's important.
*  And they both came away disappointed.
*  You know, Trump killed that border bill.
*  And he did it because he wanted it to be an issue in the election.
*  Sharon does blame Trump for killing the border bill.
*  When they questioned him on that, boy, he just kind of skirted that.
*  But she didn't believe that Harris really had a plan to really get things under control,
*  in part because of what she saw as happening under the Biden administration.
*  And he said he was going to go down and nationalize the National Guard and take these people and
*  move them out of the country.
*  And that's really upsetting or upheaval for everybody.
*  Bob has been turned off every time he's heard Trump talk about this plan to round up and
*  deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
*  You've been here 10 years, and the National Guard is going to come to your house and load
*  you up in a van and take you out because you're not an American citizen.
*  That doesn't seem realistic.
*  He thinks it's a terrible idea and wouldn't work.
*  So here you have the reads on their two biggest issues, not getting satisfying or sufficient
*  answers from either candidate on this debate stage.
*  I'm curious what else Campbell struck you from what Bob and Sharon took from this debate.
*  Well, I think their views of the candidates is most stark when you hear how they talk
*  about the war in Ukraine.
*  I don't know.
*  There's part of me that says I could see him giving Ukraine to Putin, that he thinks
*  he's so great.
*  Sharon is worried Trump is just going to give Putin whatever he wants, that he'll cozy up
*  to him.
*  She doesn't like the way he talks about him.
*  And I don't know if she has the ability to diplomacy to end it and has the respect of
*  the people to do it.
*  But she's doubtful that Harris is going to stand up to him, that she's going to be tough
*  enough when she's facing down some of these dictators.
*  How much does the January 6 stuff play in your thinking about him?
*  A lot.
*  It was also striking how they reacted to January 6.
*  Anytime he's asked about it, he had no responsibility.
*  Even at that debate.
*  Oh, I was just asked to give a speech.
*  The reads really don't like that.
*  They have real concerns about January 6 and it just highlighted everything that turns
*  them off Trump.
*  Because you've described the reads as Republicans who have become disillusioned with Trump,
*  I wonder what they made out of Harris's efforts in the debate to make some pretty overt gestures
*  to Republicans who have soured on Trump.
*  For example, she mentions that many prominent Republicans have backed her because they don't
*  like Trump.
*  Does that mean anything to the reads as seemingly of a target audience for that kind of message?
*  I actually think that gets right to their dilemma.
*  Well, I'm not surprised she's Cheney's support because Cheney hasn't liked Trump from the
*  very beginning.
*  They see these other Republicans as turned off by Trump as they are.
*  That's not the issue.
*  They don't like Trump and these other Republicans don't either.
*  I mean, that's not going to tell me how I'm going to vote.
*  I'm still more on the issue.
*  But that doesn't to them give them a case for Harris.
*  So what I'm hearing is Trump's performance in this debate clearly feeds into their discomfort
*  with them.
*  But it doesn't quite push them into the hands of Kamala Harris because they don't hear enough
*  specifics and they don't know in their hearts yet that she's ready for the job.
*  That and they're Republicans.
*  They prefer Republican policies.
*  And while they don't want to vote for Trump, it's going to take more convincing for them
*  to vote for a Democrat.
*  More convincing than the what we understand to be last confrontation between them on a
*  debate stage, which was really probably Harris's best chance to win over the reads and Trump's
*  best chance to alleviate some of their concerns.
*  As far as we know.
*  Yeah.
*  And at the end of that phone call, as I do after all the phone calls I've had with them
*  I asked them, did this move you one way or the other?
*  I didn't hear anything tonight that would push us one way or another.
*  And they basically said no.
*  You know, I am no farther to voting for either one of them than I was before.
*  And Bob, are you still like 51% of Trump?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Not anymore, not 52, but 51 or 50 and a half or something.
*  Sharon is still completely undecided.
*  She has no idea what she's going to do in November.
*  And Bob is ever so slightly leaning toward Trump, but he doesn't love it.
*  Listen, I've dragged you across these coals too often too late at night.
*  So I appreciate this again.
*  You all have a great weekend and thanks again for all of it.
*  I really do appreciate it.
*  Thank you for making us sound good.
*  All right.
*  Thank you all.
*  Have a good one.
*  You have a good one too.
*  Bye.
*  Bye.
*  Well, Campbell, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  After the break, my colleague, Stella Tan, speaks to an undecided voter who says that
*  the debate brought her much closer to a decision.
*  We'll be right back.
*  A few weeks ago on the show, we spoke to an undecided voter named Emily, who lives in
*  Dunn County, Wisconsin, a purple district in a crucial swing state.
*  She's 43 years old, works for a small business in Wisconsin's manufacturing sector, and
*  is the mom of two teenage daughters.
*  I voted since I was 18, since I've been able to vote.
*  I've been able to come to a decision.
*  This is honestly the first election where I just don't know who I'm going to vote for.
*  I need to.
*  I need to vote.
*  I don't want to.
*  It makes me sick.
*  Like Bob and Sharon Reed, Emily is a longtime Republican voter.
*  A lot of my just values in general have aligned more with the Republicans, but right now there's
*  too many extremes.
*  Who found herself deeply dissatisfied with her choices in this election.
*  You know, I have seriously thought about just writing in a candidate at this point too,
*  because our options are not looking good.
*  So like Sharon, Emily voted for Nikki Haley, not Trump, during the Republican primary,
*  even though by that point, Haley had dropped out of the race.
*  I want to see people who are going to be willing to work with each other and back to let's
*  take care of the middle class and let's stop fighting.
*  In July, with Trump as the Republican nominee and Joe Biden suddenly out of the race, we
*  asked Emily if she was open to voting for Kamala Harris.
*  I really don't know enough about her as a candidate for president to say one way or
*  the other.
*  It'll be interesting to see how she performs in debates and things coming up to see if
*  she can keep her composure.
*  For her, the debate was going to be crucial.
*  So when it was over, Daily producer Stella Tan called Emily back to see whether the debate
*  had changed any of her thinking.
*  Hello?
*  Hello?
*  Is this Emily?
*  Yes, it is.
*  How are you doing?
*  Not too bad.
*  How about you?
*  I'm doing pretty good.
*  I really appreciate you talking to me again and letting me sort of show up on your metaphorical
*  doorstep again.
*  So when we talked over the summer, it was right when Biden dropped out and Harris had
*  just become the presumptive nominee and you were still kind of getting oriented on her.
*  And I'm wondering right now, how close are you to making up your mind on who to vote
*  for for president?
*  I'm still struggling.
*  I'm still kind of torn.
*  I mean, it's kind of tricky.
*  I do come from a pretty conservative family and this hasn't been easy for them either.
*  I think they're struggling too with which way to go.
*  It's like kind of coming down to what's, you know, do you compromise on some of your beliefs
*  and some of your policy positions in order to help to preserve democracy and bring us
*  back to some level of decorum and civility?
*  And I think that's kind of gotten to be an issue.
*  And so what were the moments that most stood out for you from the debate and what did they
*  leave you thinking and feeling?
*  So maybe like an overall impression, I guess, of the debate that actually left me very frustrated
*  with former President Trump was just his overall decorum, his rhetoric.
*  My 16 year old daughter was watching with me and a big thing that we came back to was
*  the opening of the debate and the fact that he made a beeline for the podium rather than
*  trying to meet in the middle and handshake and she had to initiate that.
*  And then throughout the debate, I can't recall a time when he actually made eye contact with
*  her or looked at her.
*  And then the way that he continued to refer to they, they, and that may have been part
*  of his strategy is to continue to try to tie her to Biden.
*  But in doing that without looking at her, without going in for that handshake, without
*  actually addressing her, to me, it was very demeaning.
*  So that really bothered me.
*  And then the fact that, to be honest, for the majority of the debate, he looked like
*  my daughters did when they were toddlers and they were not getting their own way or they
*  had gotten yelled at and were sitting and pouting in the corner.
*  You know, a lot of people have been remarking on Harris's facial expressions and gestures
*  in response to some of the things that Trump was saying.
*  I'm curious how her expressions landed with you, especially in this context of you wanting
*  a president who can work across the aisle and sort of lower the temperature on the rhetoric.
*  For me, I guess some of it just kind of made me laugh.
*  And honestly, it was just like, okay, she's making this face and I'm making the same face
*  here at home.
*  Like, what did he just say?
*  Like how was this, you know, did that actually come out?
*  And I didn't think it was over the top.
*  I didn't think she was disrespectful in any way.
*  So it didn't really sway me one way or the other.
*  I wanted to ask you about a couple of things you mentioned to me when we had our conversation
*  before.
*  Yep.
*  You mentioned that the economy was a big issue for you.
*  Yes.
*  You know, is that still true?
*  And can you talk a little bit about how the debate affected your thinking on how the candidates
*  would approach economic issues?
*  Yeah, no, definitely the economy is still a major issue for me.
*  To be honest, I was really disappointed in both candidates.
*  I was really hoping to hear something more.
*  For me, Donald Trump, all he was talking about was tariffs and that's not going to fix the
*  economy in and of itself.
*  And so there was nothing else there from him.
*  And Kamala, while she did have her three points, you know, she was talking about small business,
*  she was talking about $25,000 for first time homeowners, $6,000 for families in the first
*  year of life.
*  And I'm sure there's people out there for that.
*  That was wonderful and they were happy to hear that.
*  I am a college educated woman, working class in my 40s.
*  I own a home and I have teenage children.
*  So for me, this is all great.
*  You know, she's focusing on how to help people get started.
*  How do you help all of the millions of Americans who are already small business owners, I work
*  for a small business owner, you know, for homeowners.
*  In the last five to seven years, our homeowners insurance has basically doubled.
*  So what are you going to do for homeowners?
*  How are you going to help us to continue to live in our homes, to maintain our homes?
*  Those are the things I really would have liked to have seen from her last night and I didn't.
*  So there was one more thing.
*  You mentioned reproductive rights in our conversation last time.
*  Do you kind of lean toward one or the other on that issue?
*  So this is one of those, I think, too, where I kind of struggle because people, they want
*  to pigeonhole you into one view or the other.
*  You know, if you're conservative, you view it this way and if you're liberal, you view
*  it this way.
*  And I, when it comes to, you know, reproductive rights and specifically abortion, I do have
*  very strong feelings about the manner in which that should be utilized.
*  I do consider myself pro-life, so more of a conservative.
*  You know, I don't view that as a means of birth control, but I do also understand and
*  can appreciate through different experiences, life experiences of my own, I can understand
*  where this is not a black and white issue and there has to be room for that.
*  There has to be exceptions.
*  There has to be places where this can happen.
*  And so I'm still struggling personally with like, yes, I don't want to see it used in
*  this way, but I don't want to see people being stuck in a position where they have no choices.
*  And so she kind of backed away from answering how she felt about late term abortion.
*  And I was kind of wishing she would have talked about that, but by the same token,
*  I was thoroughly disgusted by his comment.
*  You know, he kept calling it abortion after birth, but if a child is born, it's not abortion.
*  Like it's just by definition.
*  And so essentially you're talking about, you know, execution of children.
*  And to me, that was just so off the wall.
*  And so, I mean, for him to continue spewing that is just sickening.
*  I know you said earlier that you were still struggling, but did the debate help you make
*  up your mind on who to vote for?
*  I don't know if I'm comfortable, even like with myself to myself yet.
*  I'm not sure that I'm comfortable saying yes or no to that one way or the other.
*  I'm not sure what I'm hoping to hear yet.
*  You know, I don't know if there's something that I'm wanting to hear.
*  Whether it's right or wrong or makes any sense when you grow up a certain way, whether
*  you grow up liberal or you grow up conservative.
*  I think it is hard for a lot of people if that's what you've always been and that's
*  what you've known and you've been very comfortable in that.
*  I think there is just some level of uncomfortableness and I don't know, you know, subconscious.
*  If you feel like you're betraying what you are and where you've been, even though that's
*  not true, you know, people grow and people evolve.
*  I wouldn't say that like I would be changing necessarily my values or where I necessarily
*  see things falling on policy, but it's coming down to more of a matter of let's restore
*  some civility and decorum into the White House, the sanctity of the president of the United
*  States, that office, what that means, what that stands for.
*  And let's try to start bringing people back together.
*  You know, one thing she said last night was let the divisiveness be on the policy issues,
*  on all of this other unimportant stuff that we're trying to make into issues and that's
*  essentially dividing us.
*  Well, there's not a whole lot of time till the election.
*  And I know you said that you're not quite sure what you're hoping to hear, but I'm
*  wondering if it gets to be November 5th, what do you think you'll do?
*  Do you think you'll go to the voting booth and make the call there?
*  Or is there a chance you might stay home or?
*  No, I definitely will not stay home.
*  I definitely will vote.
*  Or writing in, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, no, I know we had talked about writing and a candidate.
*  I think after last night, I would feel more comfortable making a decision versus writing
*  someone in off the call.
*  I would say that it definitely pushed me in one direction.
*  After watching him and listening to him and the attempts to find ways to continue to divide
*  us in the way that he treated her last night and the way that he treated the American public,
*  it definitely pushed me to vote for Kamala.
*  This was so interesting, Emily.
*  I'm really, really grateful to you for talking to me.
*  Well, I thank you for your time.
*  I appreciate it.
*  All right.
*  Take care, Emily.
*  You too.
*  Have a good night.
*  You too.
*  Bye.
*  Thanks.
*  Bye.
*  Over the next 49 days, we'll keep in touch with Bob, Sharon, and Emily to learn who they
*  ultimately chose to vote for and why.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about
*  cat memes.
*  In an interview on Sunday with CNN, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice presidential
*  nominee, said that he stood by the debunked claims spread by he and Donald Trump that
*  Haitian migrants in his state were eating people's pets.
*  But it wasn't just a meme.
*  If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering
*  of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do, Dana, because you guys...
*  Moments later, on the same network, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, scold
*  Vance for standing by those false claims.
*  I mean, Dana, that was bonkers.
*  Listen, the governor of Ohio, the mayor of that town in Ohio, has said this is all made
*  up.
*  These are all lies.
*  There's no truth to it.
