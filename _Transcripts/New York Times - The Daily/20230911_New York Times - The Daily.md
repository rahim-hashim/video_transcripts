# U.S. v. Google
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sloHGysP7P4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  For years, the government has been trying to rein in big tech, pursuing some of the
*  biggest and most powerful companies on the Internet.
*  This week, the government takes on one of those companies in the first monopoly trial
*  of the Internet era.
*  Today, my colleague David McCabe on the government's case against Google and what it might mean
*  for the future if it wins.
*  It's Monday, September 11th.
*  So David, this week in a federal court in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department is
*  making its case against Google.
*  What's this all about?
*  The government has become increasingly obsessed with this question of whether the tech giants,
*  including Google, got so big by breaking laws that were designed to rein in corporations
*  more than a century ago.
*  And by doing that, have they hurt consumers?
*  Have they hurt other companies, smaller companies that are coming up with innovative ideas?
*  And this week, government lawyers are going to walk into a courtroom and begin to make
*  the case that Google has broken the law.
*  And this is the first time the Justice Department is trying to do this with a tech giant in
*  decades.
*  The last time was when they took Microsoft to court in 1998.
*  And then the tech industry changed.
*  The Internet created these giant companies that built big platforms for how we access
*  information and culture and communicate.
*  And Google is probably more emblematic of that era of the Internet than any other company.
*  Its name literally became a verb synonymous with what it does.
*  And this case isn't just going to be about the last era of technology.
*  It's also going to be about the next era of technology.
*  Because hanging over this case are developments like artificial intelligence and questions
*  about whether companies like Google are poised because they have been so dominant to also
*  dominate the next era of technology.
*  So what is the actual case here?
*  I mean, what exactly is the government's argument here about how Google is hurting consumers?
*  I mean, usually you think, you know, monopolies are bad because they raise consumer prices.
*  But Google, of course, is free.
*  You're right.
*  And that makes this case unusual.
*  But the government says that basically three groups of people are being harmed here, that
*  Google has this monopoly over online search and crucially that it's illegally abused that
*  monopoly first to shut out its rivals, think startups, or even a company like Microsoft
*  that make rival search engines.
*  And that that's led to this absence of choice that when people go to search that Google
*  is really the main clear option for them to use.
*  And the Justice Department says that has hurt two other groups of people.
*  That it's hurt advertisers who do pay to use Google's advertising services, that Google
*  is able, because they don't have much of a choice, to charge them potentially higher
*  prices.
*  And then the Justice Department is also saying that consumers, you and me, who do use Google
*  for free have been hurt in ways that can't necessarily be quantified by price, that they're
*  potentially hurt when it comes to the quality of search results, and that they're potentially
*  hurt when it comes to the policies that Google is able to impose upon them.
*  Google, of course, hoovers up personal data from anyone who uses the service in order
*  to target advertisements, because that's how they make money.
*  And the Justice Department is saying that one of the reasons they're able to so aggressively
*  collect the personal data of their users is because they have all of this power and
*  there aren't that many other choices if you want to use Google and you're concerned about
*  your privacy.
*  So basically they're saying that Google has kind of blotted out other companies that could
*  be providing the marketplace with products that would ultimately be better for us, like
*  taking away our choice, essentially.
*  That's exactly right.
*  It gets at the core of what these antitrust laws are about, because the government believes
*  that if there's a fair competition on the merits, that consumers end up with more choice,
*  they end up with better products, they end up paying less money for products, because
*  companies are incentivized to offer something better to consumers, to treat other people
*  in the marketplace fairly.
*  It's actually not illegal in the United States to simply have a monopoly.
*  If consumers were just choosing Google because they had access to a number of really good
*  options and they just thought Google was the best and Google had a monopoly as a result,
*  that would be fine under the law.
*  What is illegal in the United States is getting that monopoly or keeping that monopoly by
*  illegally excluding your competitors.
*  And that is exactly what the government says Google has done here.
*  In other words, that Google is dominant not because they offer the best product, but because
*  they used their weight and their dominance to suppress their competitors.
*  Okay, so walk me through what the government is alleging that Google did to suppress competition.
*  So to understand the core of the government's case, it's helpful to think about your smartphone.
*  Okay.
*  So I have an iPhone.
*  Often when I'm searching for information, I open the browser on my iPhone, which is
*  the default browser.
*  The one that Apple makes is called Safari.
*  I open Safari and there's that little bar at the top of the browser, right?
*  Where you usually write in my times.com.
*  I just search.
*  I put my search query there and that by default goes to Google.
*  Actually, this is true on a lot of different smartphones.
*  And the reason why is that Google has these contracts, these agreements with Apple, with
*  Mozilla, which makes Firefox, with people who make smartphones, even with wireless carriers
*  to be in different ways, the default search engine on the smartphone.
*  Like you don't have to decide which search engine you use, right?
*  It's just there.
*  It's Google.
*  By default, it's Google.
*  And what the Justice Mormon says is that this web of contracts, which consumers don't think
*  about, definitely not.
*  These contracts actually were an illegal means of maintaining its power in search because
*  they so powerfully drive consumers to use Google rather than other search engines.
*  So how exactly did Google come to be this default search engine in so many other products
*  that aren't Google products?
*  Walk me through what they did to get these deals.
*  First of all, they pay billions of dollars.
*  These deals are thought to be incredibly valuable.
*  And there's a number of different ways that this works.
*  The most prominent at the trial will probably be its agreements with Apple and Mozilla because
*  so many people use their browser.
*  Apple, of course, is its own giant company with a big profile.
*  But Google also has these other agreements with smartphone makers that use its Android
*  Okay.
*  To be basically pre-installed as an app on those phones.
*  So maybe some phones have a search bar on the home screen.
*  That could by default be Google.
*  So there are a lot of different ways that people search across their mobile devices.
*  But what the government is alleging is that in all of these cases, whether it's your browser,
*  whether it's an app on the home screen of your smartphone, that Google has used these
*  contracts to basically lock up that real estate.
*  If you think about it as like the best real estate on Main Street, that they have locked
*  up that real estate using these contracts.
*  Google has that fancy corner office.
*  Google has every one of those stores, the ones that you want to just walk into.
*  Exactly.
*  And the one that it's importantly easiest to walk into.
*  It's the one next to your parking spot.
*  So it's the one you're most likely to go into because it's right there.
*  And that a lot of consumers, when they search for information, they just go with the default.
*  And as a result, these agreements, the Justice Department has said, are by far the best way
*  to get search queries.
*  Okay, but David, hold on.
*  Why should I care whether Google is the default search engine on my phone?
*  Just speaking for myself here, but in general, I like Google search engine.
*  And I'd imagine a lot of other people feel the same way.
*  So how does this move by Google represent the harm to me, like Jane consumer, that the
*  government is alleging?
*  This is where we get back to that idea of choice.
*  So the Justice Department says that there's a really pernicious cycle at play here.
*  That Google has so many users, that it's able to collect more data than anyone else it competes
*  with to make its search results better.
*  And that because it can make its search results better than anybody else, that users come
*  to Google even more often, continuing the cycle.
*  And what the Justice Department is saying is that these agreements to make Google the
*  default on a smartphone, put that process like on speed, on overdrive, and only contribute
*  to increasing Google's scale and size, which in turn, it's able to use to be more valuable
*  to users and elbow out competitors.
*  So basically, they're the default on all of our products.
*  We use it without really choosing or thinking about it.
*  And the fact that we all use it means that their dominance is multiplied, right?
*  Like exponentially, like as you say, it puts it on speed, making it harder and harder for
*  other companies to compete with them.
*  That's right.
*  That's exactly what the Justice Department is arguing here.
*  They're saying that because Google has this compounded dominance, that's in part the results
*  of agreements that they say break the law, that has allowed them to suppress other competitors
*  that might actually offer consumers options that they want more than Google.
*  So take for example, there's a company called DuckDuckGo, and they make a search engine
*  that's whole sort of value proposition, is that it collects less data than Google does
*  about you.
*  Now, the Justice Department is arguing that companies like DuckDuckGo could offer benefits
*  to consumers, could offer choices to consumers about how much their data is collected, but
*  that that gets short circuited by this cycle of dominance juiced by illegal agreements
*  that Google has engaged in.
*  Got it.
*  So what does Google say to all of this?
*  I mean, what do you expect its defense to be based on your reporting?
*  So do you remember how you said that you like using Google, people like using Google, that
*  you like this product good?
*  That is Google's defense.
*  Okay.
*  That people who use Google choose Google because they find it helpful, not because they've
*  used illegal agreements to force their way to the front of the line.
*  We're just good guys.
*  Yeah, that they are winning because they've made the best product and that it's a product
*  that people find helpful that people choose to come to Google because it's a high quality
*  product.
*  Apple, Samsung, Mozilla choose to partner with Google to make the search engine the
*  default because Google says they're the best.
*  But they also say that people do have other choices, that they can change the default
*  search engines with only a few taps on their smartphone so that these agreements at the
*  heart of the case aren't even exclusive at all.
*  And they say that they're not even as dominant as DOJ claims in the first place.
*  How's that?
*  So, the Justice Department says that Google has around a 90% market share.
*  When you define their competition is what is called general search.
*  So that means like Bing or Duck Duck Go.
*  Basically DOJ says one-stop shop search engines where you might go for a whole variety of
*  things.
*  But Google is saying we have a smaller share of the search engine market because we compete
*  not just with the one-stop shops, but we compete with Amazon when it comes to searching for
*  a product online.
*  We compete with TikTok or Reddit when it comes to answering other queries.
*  We compete with Spotify or Chat GPT.
*  So the Justice Department basically says Google is a big fish in a small pond.
*  And Google says it's not a pond, it's a giant ocean.
*  Google's saying you got the wrong body of water.
*  Exactly, yeah.
*  Google is saying you're looking at the wrong universe.
*  And if the judge comes to agree with that idea, it's going to be really hard for the
*  Justice Department to make its case.
*  Because the judge in this trial first has to decide is Google a monopoly here at all?
*  Do they have monopoly power?
*  And that will hinge on how big or small the world of competitors it has is.
*  Right?
*  If you're a small dot in a big sea of competitors, it's a lot harder to have monopoly power than
*  if you are the same size dot in a tiny puddle of competitors.
*  And once the judge figures out where he falls on that question, if Google does have monopoly
*  power, then he'll have to figure out did these agreements break the law?
*  Did they step over the line from aggressive growth in the business to an illegal and unreasonable
*  restraint on its competition?
*  In other words, did they kind of cheat their way to the front of the pack?
*  So in no way is the DOJ's case a slam dunk?
*  It's going to be tough.
*  It's going to be tough.
*  And these cases are significant.
*  There are millions of documents that have been turned over as part of the evidence process.
*  There are going to be witnesses that include corporate executives from Google, but also
*  from competitors, from these companies that it signs agreements with.
*  There's going to be testimony from economists who get paid sometimes as much as lawyers
*  in these cases to provide expert analysis to a judge.
*  And the judge in this case is going to have to look at all of that and figure out where
*  to draw the line on does Google have the power that the justice ordinance says it does?
*  And did they step over into illegal territory in how they maintained it?
*  And what's really new about this is that it's the first time they've tried to bring one
*  of these cases in this era of the modern Internet platforms.
*  Google, Meadow, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon, Apple, they all operate
*  big online platforms.
*  And the government has never before had a trial like this where they've aired out their
*  concerns about how those platforms got so powerful in public and in the kind of minute
*  detail that we'll see over the next 10 weeks.
*  So the judge is going to have to rule one way or another.
*  But whether Google wins or the Justice Department wins, it's going to be a big deal for the
*  technology industry.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, David, this is a big and novel case and totally unclear what the outcome is going
*  to be. Let's talk about the possible scenarios here.
*  So what would it mean if the judge sides with Google?
*  So the devil will be in the details of his ruling.
*  It's a complex case.
*  He's going to have to make a lot of individual calls that will add up to a decision.
*  But broadly, I think there's sort of two lenses through which a Google victory would be viewed.
*  The first is from sort of a Silicon Valley perspective.
*  If the judge rules for Google, it's possible that he'll find that these harms that DOJ
*  has described, that they say happened as a result of Google's kind of rapacious and
*  illegal growth, that those harms weren't there.
*  And that could send a message to Google and other Silicon Valley companies that this increased
*  government oversight in recent years is really more bark than bite.
*  And that gets us to the second lens, which is how does Washington view a Google victory?
*  I think if Google wins, one thing you may hear in Washington from people who are skeptical
*  of the tech companies is that it proves that these antitrust laws, which have been interpreted
*  in the last several decades as being very narrowly focused on instances where consumers
*  are harmed, particularly through price, that that interpretation of these laws really is
*  not suited to taking on Silicon Valley and that that understanding of the law fails to
*  capture potential ways that consumers might be harmed when it comes to the collection
*  of their data, the quality of the product they use and the choices they have available
*  to them.
*  Right.
*  We live in a data world now and that's essentially the currency.
*  That's exactly right.
*  We are now in an economy where some of the biggest and most prominent companies give
*  their product to consumers for free, but collect a lot of their personal data.
*  And the question is, can the laws handle that?
*  Okay.
*  So what about the other side of things?
*  So say the government wins the case.
*  What happens to Google?
*  So that is the big question.
*  And it's one that the judge won't even consider until he's decided whether or not Google has
*  broken the law.
*  But if he does find the Google broken law, the DOJ was right.
*  If he rules in the government's favor, there are a couple different routes that the government
*  has traditionally taken to try and address concerns about corporations that have broken
*  antitrust laws.
*  The most radical option available to a judge is breaking up a company.
*  Like actually breaking up Google?
*  Well, this has happened before.
*  So in the 80s, AT&T agreed to break itself up into seven regional companies under pressure
*  from the Justice Department.
*  They were known as Ma Bell.
*  These companies were known as the Baby Bells.
*  And there are people who really believe that that was successful in introducing competition
*  to what had been an extremely concentrated phone business.
*  But like, is that the right analogy?
*  I mean, that was a phone company with regional carriers.
*  This is an internet company.
*  Like is that apples to apples?
*  It's not.
*  And Google's search business isn't necessarily something you could split up like AT&T, like
*  Standard Oil at the turn of the century, along regional lines.
*  And it will be a tough question for the court of how you would use a kind of structural
*  change in order to stop the behavior and harms that the Justice Department has identified
*  in its lawsuit.
*  Okay.
*  So what's the other potential fix in the event that the government wins?
*  So a court could also basically demand that Google change its behavior.
*  So the Justice Department has not said a lot about what kind of fixes they want in this
*  case, but they have asked the court to stop Google from just doing the things it describes
*  in the lawsuit.
*  So that could mean new restrictions on the kinds of agreements that Google can enter
*  to be these default search providers on a smartphone.
*  Meaning those agreements with Apple and with other companies, the ones that give Google
*  that prime real estate right next to the parking spot, those would either disappear or change
*  to make competition more fair.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And one other thing that's been tried in Europe is presenting some smartphone users with a
*  screen that allows them to choose their search engine.
*  So there's not the same kind of hard and fast default.
*  Okay.
*  But if all of this boils down to just a few more clicks on a setup screen, like what was
*  it all for?
*  I mean, does it really solve what the government was saying is at issue here, which is tech
*  is too big.
*  And by definition, that is a problem.
*  Ultimately, the question will be after all the legal wrangling is done, after the judge
*  on a fix in this case, did it change Google's behavior?
*  Did it change the way they approach building their business?
*  And the stakes for that become a lot bigger when you think about the future and especially
*  when you think about the future of artificial intelligence, where Google is already a major
*  player.
*  What do you mean?
*  Explain that.
*  So Google has a lot of information.
*  Google search is one of the biggest compendiums of information on the planet.
*  And information is like rocket fuel for artificial intelligence.
*  So the question is, does their dominance in search lead to potential future dominance
*  in artificial intelligence?
*  And does the court's fix, if it rules in favor of the Justice Department, ripple outward
*  to the rest of the industry?
*  Does it make Silicon Valley more competitive at a time when companies across Silicon Valley
*  are in this heating up battle to define the next era of the internet?
*  David, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know.
*  Over the weekend, a powerful earthquake struck Morocco, killing more than 2,000 people and
*  setting off frantic rescue efforts through rubble-strewn city streets and remote rural
*  areas.
*  The hardest hit settlements were in the high Atlas Mountains outside the city of Marrakesh,
*  where the few roads were blocked by debris.
*  The death toll was expected to rise because many homes in the area are made of mud bricks,
*  a construction method highly vulnerable to earthquakes.
*  The quake, which had a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale, was the strongest to hit
*  the area in a century.
*  And a pair of champions were crowned at the U.S. Open tennis major over the weekend.
*  One a prodigy announcing her arrival on the scene, and the other an all-time great cementing
*  his status in the record books.
*  In the women's final on Sunday, 19-year-old American Coco Goff chased and lunged toward
*  the ball, rattling Irina Sabalenka of Belarus and sending Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens
*  into a state of delirium.
*  The remarkable win established Goff as the new face of women's tennis in America.
*  Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic solidified his reputation as the greatest player of the modern era
*  by defeating Daniil Medvedev of Russia in the men's singles final.
*  The win, the 24th major title of Djokovic's career, moves him one past the record held
*  by Serena Williams for the most career single Grand Slams.
*  Today's episode was produced by Olivia Natt, Moosh Zayde, Diana Wynn, and Shannon Lin.
