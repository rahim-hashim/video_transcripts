# The Spoiler Threat of R.F.K. Jr.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ew-QVvVq2M)
*  This is Mary Wilson, producer for The Daily, in downtown Philadelphia waiting for a campaign
*  event with presidential candidate RFK Jr.
*  It's about three hours before he's expected to speak and there are already maybe a few
*  dozens of hoarders here.
*  And I'm going to start talking to him.
*  Are you a supporter of RFK Jr.?
*  Um, actually, I'm a supporter big time.
*  I have followed him for several years even before he decided to be a presidential campaign.
*  I have always appreciated his honesty.
*  I've listened to everything he's, every interview I can get my hands on.
*  And I think RFK just wants the people to know the truth.
*  And from the research that I've done, the little rabbit holes that I've gone down, it
*  aligns with a lot of stuff that Kennedy says to be the truth.
*  I'm going to RFK.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was once dismissed as a fringe figure in the 2024 presidential
*  race.
*  But this week, as he announced an independent run for the White House, he's striking fear
*  within both the Democratic and Republican parties.
*  My colleague, political correspondent Rebecca O'Brien, explains why.
*  It's Thursday, October 12th.
*  Rebecca, a few days ago, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he was running for president
*  as an independent, which all but ensures that he can be a candidate in the general election
*  next fall.
*  He doesn't have to go through a difficult primary process.
*  He can't really be knocked out of the race because he's not a Democrat or Republican.
*  And the question immediately became, when he announced, how much does this really matter?
*  Because third party and independent candidates have a very spotty record in the U.S.
*  So the Democratic and Republican parties think that this move really does matter because
*  it has the potential to draw votes from both sides.
*  There's always a risk that independent candidates will draw support from the two parties.
*  In this case, we're facing an election where in all likelihood, we're going to have a
*  rematch of Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
*  And they're both, you know, they have bases of support, but they're both unpopular in
*  large segments of the population.
*  People are kind of tired of them.
*  People are tired of them.
*  And Kennedy in particular speaks to, I think, a pretty sizable population of people who
*  are sick of the two party system and tired of the narratives on both sides.
*  And so their fear is that in a three way race, he would end up drawing support from both
*  candidates.
*  And from what I've seen in person at various Kennedy events, he draws people from across
*  the political spectrum.
*  And it's a pretty powerful coalition.
*  And just in a sort of numerical sense, it doesn't take that much, as we've seen in
*  recent elections, to swing the results.
*  Right. And that wouldn't be the first time that this has happened.
*  There's, despite third party and independent candidates' inability to ever win these races
*  in the U.S., there's a long and rich history of them acting, and you're kind of getting
*  at this, as spoilers, as people who draw just enough support away from one or both major
*  party candidates to become decisive.
*  I mean, it was widely believed Ralph Nader did that in 2000, winning just enough votes
*  in key states to cost Al Gore the election.
*  Some believe Ross Perot did that in 1992 and helped defeat George H.W. Bush in his re-election.
*  So from what you're describing, that's the fear that Democrats and Republicans have.
*  Not that RFK Jr. becomes president, but that he costs one of them the presidency.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Okay. I want you to explain how we get to a point where RFK presents this kind of a
*  threat and can draw this unique coalition that you alluded to just a few moments ago.
*  So what is that story?
*  So Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a scion of pretty much American royalty, right?
*  His uncle, former president John F. Kennedy, was assassinated when he was nine years old.
*  Five years later, his father was assassinated.
*  During his own run for the presidency.
*  Right.
*  And so he's 14 years old.
*  He's the pallbearer at his own father's funeral.
*  And in the years that followed, he had a troubled youth, troubled and privileged, and he was
*  addicted to heroin at one point.
*  But then by the mid-80s, he sort of establishes himself as an environmental lawyer and he's
*  a litigator and he's persistent.
*  It's against the law.
*  You're not allowed to pollute the air or the water in this country.
*  What people who have known him admire about him is that he is determined and tireless.
*  I sued them.
*  It took 11 years for us to finally win that lawsuit.
*  At some point during this phase, he is diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia, which affects the
*  sound of his voice.
*  It sounds sort of rugged and rough and it doesn't stop him, obviously.
*  It sort of becomes part of his public persona.
*  Kind of his vocal trademark.
*  Right.
*  And to some observers, it sounds almost like he's been out for days on end fighting the
*  tough fight and has run his body and his voice hoarse.
*  When we destroy nature, we diminish ourselves and we're imposing a cost upon ourselves
*  that I don't think is prudent around our children, that I don't think we have the right to impose.
*  Thank you very much.
*  And at the height of his environmental law career, he's really a source of pride for
*  his family members because he is fulfilling the promise of the Kennedy family and what
*  his father was unable to do in his life that was cut short.
*  And then by the turn of the millennium, he's had so much success in identifying and holding
*  to account these corporations that have caused chemical spills and long-term injury to the
*  environment and to people that he starts to attract the attention of what at the time
*  was a growing community of vaccine skeptics.
*  And these are largely parents of children who have suffered some sort of, they call
*  it injury, it's often vaccine injury.
*  And people who believe that autism is caused by vaccinations or that other developmental
*  disorders and delays are linked to chemicals and vaccines, chemicals in water, even more
*  broadly than that, that the public health infrastructure of this country might be complicit
*  in damaging their children.
*  So these parents see Robert Kennedy Jr. and his environmental work as making him, they
*  think, a natural ally in this fight, which we should say, especially in the case of autism,
*  is a belief that's been widely debunked, but yet very firmly held by many people.
*  Right.
*  Kennedy then takes up this mantle of the injured wronged parent and begins to take on these
*  cases and do his own research.
*  And then in 2005, he publishes these articles in Salon and Rolling Stone in which he purports
*  to lay out scientific evidence of vaccine damage to children.
*  So this is kind of his national general audience debut as a major force in this parental world
*  of vaccine skepticism.
*  Correct.
*  Now, those articles have since been retracted or qualified as the studies that gird them
*  have kind of become widely debunked.
*  But that didn't stop him.
*  He has continued to raise questions.
*  In the years following his embrace of this cause, there were all sorts of instances of
*  measles outbreaks, a rise in vaccine skepticism, and he played a really important pivotal role
*  in bringing that community maybe not to the mainstream, but giving it more prominence
*  and acceptability.
*  Right.
*  Here's a Kennedy, a scion of American political royalty saying it's okay, maybe even it's
*  your duty not to get a vaccine.
*  Right.
*  You know, if a Kennedy is saying we can't trust our government and our public health
*  establishment, I mean, we have to listen to him and he gives it credibility.
*  He gives the movement legs.
*  But as big as this movement became, I don't think anyone was quite prepared for how well
*  the COVID pandemic would tap into that underlying skepticism and general fear.
*  Right.
*  What does Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have to say when COVID rolls around and the government
*  begins developing and releasing COVID vaccines?
*  So I think we have to step back and see it as the bigger picture.
*  His issue with the COVID response was not just about the vaccine.
*  In the course of his sort of progression from environmental steward to anti-vaccine crusader,
*  he developed a deep distrust of the government.
*  And that has manifested itself not just in public health issues that he's raised, but
*  also his open questioning of pieces of American history, including his own family.
*  He has raised questions about whether the CIA played a role in the death of his uncle,
*  John F. Kennedy.
*  Somewhere along the way, this skepticism about the public health establishment turned into
*  a skepticism about the American government itself.
*  From what I'm gathering, perhaps a conspiratorially minded approach to all things government.
*  That is exactly right.
*  He sees in the workings of America, a large conspiracy and corruption.
*  So his role in the COVID pandemic is multifaceted.
*  Well, they tell you we just want you to lock down for two weeks.
*  But then 20 months later, they still have us locked down.
*  He pretty much immediately seizes on the growing public skepticism of lockdown orders, of government
*  intrusion into the free market as he sees it.
*  The minute they hand you that vaccine passport, every right that you have is transformed into
*  a privilege contingent upon your obedience to arbitrary government dictates.
*  It will make you a slave.
*  He deeply distrusted the efforts of local and federal government to restrain the free
*  movement of people.
*  And if you're going to give 22,000 vaccines to prevent one death, you better make sure
*  the vaccine doesn't kill anybody.
*  And finally, he openly questioned whether the COVID vaccines were safe.
*  We are watching something now that I never believed that I would see in my lifetime.
*  That one day the United States would be overtaken by fascism, orchestrated by Tony Fauci.
*  And this led pretty quickly to him and a group that he ran being kicked off social media
*  platforms.
*  YouTube videos in which he espoused these theories were also removed from the platform.
*  And of course, this only confirmed in his mind and in the mind of his supporters that
*  there was a vast conspiracy to silence him.
*  Right.
*  Because what could seem more like everyone trying to censor you than being kicked off
*  social media platforms, I'm guessing the reason they did that, in fact, I recall it, is because
*  those platforms believed he was spreading dangerous misinformation that endangered public
*  health.
*  Correct.
*  So Rebecca, around this time, I'm really curious, what are people close to Kennedy making of
*  his transformation from this lionized public health hero to someone who seems to becoming
*  more and more of a fringy conspiracy theorist?
*  Well, let's talk about his family.
*  I think that over the course of his growing involvement with the anti-vaccine movement,
*  he had already alienated them.
*  Members of the Kennedy family.
*  Members of the Kennedy family.
*  And he was sort of seen as this sort of fringy wacko.
*  But his move to center stage during the COVID pandemic, I think, starts drawing alarms from
*  people in his family and people close to him.
*  Because now what had been Uncle Bobby's dinner table conspiracy theories are getting more
*  attention.
*  And he's drawing a growing crowd of supporters, people who may not agree with his vaccine
*  views or may not agree with his work on autism and mercury or had no idea that he'd even
*  been involved in that, are drawn to his message that the COVID lockdowns are totalitarian
*  and are drawn to his anti-government screeds and his sort of open questioning of what are
*  we doing here?
*  Some of his own siblings started publicly pushing back against that and saying we pretty
*  much categorically reject what he has to say about COVID.
*  They're disavowing him publicly.
*  They're disavowing him publicly.
*  But he doesn't really care.
*  He decides to take this growing base of public support, his growing platform, and enter the
*  presidential race.
*  And in keeping with his family's history, his own voting record, he declares in April
*  of this year that he is going to run as a Democrat.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Rebecca, beyond family legacy, beyond the fact that RFK Jr. is a member of Democratic
*  political royalty, what's his logic in entering the presidential race as a Democrat, given
*  the reality that there is an incumbent Democratic president and taking out incumbents in a primary
*  is just really hard?
*  So he would say that he is running as a Kennedy Democrat.
*  Which means what?
*  Well, it's a nostalgic play, really, because what he's saying is that the Democratic Party
*  used to be a party that was critical of war, that pushed back against corporate interests,
*  that represented the common person, and that the Democratic Party has forsaken that.
*  And one thing that has emerged from his work in the anti-vaccine universe is a belief that
*  certain very powerful corporations are secretly determining the course of American governance
*  and that they are trying to co-opt and hold captive entire branches of government for
*  their own greedy purposes.
*  What are some examples of that, according to him?
*  So he mentions in particular BlackRock.
*  The big investment company?
*  Yes, and its capture, as he sees it, of American housing and real estate.
*  He sees Lockheed Martin, the defense contractor, as being inextricably bound up in American
*  foreign policy and that Democrats are no longer willing to push back against that.
*  He sees pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna as being inextricably bound up
*  in the response to the coronavirus pandemic and standing to profit immensely from government
*  policies.
*  So he sees essentially Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, the US government as being basically
*  held hostage by special interests and by big corporations.
*  Which is a pretty populist strain of Democratic politics, which seems also to be tinged a
*  little bit with something of a conspiratorial mindedness.
*  Right.
*  And the conspiratorial mindset is not helped by the fact that this year, the Democratic
*  National Committee decided to essentially rig or rejigger the-
*  Depending on who you are.
*  Depending on who you are and who you ask, the primary process so that Joe Biden would
*  have the easiest possible path to reelection.
*  Right.
*  We've talked about this on the show.
*  This was the Democratic Party's decision to change the primary schedule.
*  It was supposed to start in Iowa.
*  Instead, the party changed it to start in a state that Joe Biden did very well in in
*  2020 South Carolina.
*  The party in Biden said that's because it's a more diverse state than Iowa, which is typically
*  even first.
*  But to some, and I'm sure Kennedy, it looks a lot like a plan to renominate Joe Biden.
*  Right.
*  So it looks to Kennedy that the DNC is rigging it against him.
*  And it's particularly frustrating for him because when he enters the race, he starts
*  polling very well.
*  How well?
*  There were some polls of Democrats where he was up at 20%.
*  That's a big-
*  It's a big number.
*  That's not insignificant.
*  So you can imagine that to somebody who's already in a kind of conspiratorial mindset,
*  he sees this as the Democratic Party stifling a meaningful challenge to their preferred
*  candidate.
*  Right.
*  And that is compounded by the fact that he continuously was calling for a debate.
*  He wanted to debate Joe Biden.
*  And debate is a big deal for him.
*  He wanted an opportunity to have his perspective heard and to demand an answer and response
*  from the incumbent.
*  And what was the response?
*  There was no response.
*  They will not schedule a debate because the DNC is backing the incumbent president, Joe
*  Biden.
*  Which must be very frustrating because if you're at 20% in a poll, that's higher than
*  many of the Republicans who definitely get to debate each other.
*  Right.
*  So that's why he decides that there is no path forward for him in the Democratic Party.
*  And that's how we get to his decision just a few days ago that he is going to run as
*  an independent.
*  So tell us about that announcement.
*  Here we are.
*  Liberty Bell nearby.
*  That's a beautiful day.
*  So it was in Philadelphia and I went with a producer from the Daily Mary Wilson.
*  It was staged in front of the National Constitution Museum.
*  And maybe upward of a thousand people were there.
*  Practice now.
*  Everybody's invited to dance.
*  It's sort of like a hippie Trump rally.
*  And are you ready for today?
*  Are you ready for the next president of the United States, Bobby Kennedy?
*  Are we ready to win?
*  I'm here to declare myself an independent candidate.
*  And what is his message as he announces that he is an independent candidate for president?
*  It's very painful for me to let go of the party of my uncles, my father, my grandfather
*  and both of my great grandfathers, Honey Fitz.
*  He basically said that it was a very difficult decision for him to leave the party of his
*  childhood and of his family, but he felt that he had no choice.
*  Americans are weary.
*  They're tired of the culture war.
*  And people suspect that the divisions are deliberately orchestrated.
*  What I heard in Philadelphia was Kennedy taking his message of independence and of anti-corruption
*  and even of a little bit of conspiracy and making a bigger tent of it and saying, I want
*  to speak for the people.
*  We're a populist movement that defies left, right divisions.
*  I'm proud to say that my supporters include both pro-lifers and pro-choicers.
*  They include climate activists and climate skeptics.
*  They include vaccinated and unvaccinated.
*  This was his effort, more than I'd ever heard him say before, to define himself as part
*  of a movement, as the vanguard of a movement.
*  And inviting people to join him.
*  And based on what you saw in this audience, how did that message resonate with the people there?
*  So Mary and I wade out into the crowd and we speak with all sorts of people.
*  When did you start taking a look at R.F.K. Jr.?
*  Well, I was looking around for anybody but Biden.
*  We speak with Democrats who want an alternative to Biden.
*  Historically, I've pretty much voted Democrat, but I feel that the Democratic Party has taken
*  Black America for granted.
*  Who feel may be betrayed by the Democratic Party.
*  I've always been a Democrat.
*  So I like the ability to actually vote for somebody who does have democratic values,
*  but is more modern, I guess.
*  These are lifelong Democrats in some cases who voted for Obama and Biden.
*  Do you care to be interviewed at all?
*  I am absolutely a conservative and I've never voted for a Democrat myself.
*  We spoke with Republicans who voted for Donald Trump in the past two elections.
*  I was so fed up after the last election.
*  You know, you look at the polls and stuff and some of the outcomes just don't make sense or whatever.
*  So I was frustrated with the system.
*  There's also a strain of people who are very drawn to his name.
*  I don't know, I like the Kennedy family.
*  They did a lot of great things for this country.
*  So I support the Kennedys.
*  Really people across the political spectrum and people of both parties that we spoke to
*  had a tendency to repeat back some of the theories.
*  The assassination of his uncle when he's talking about like it might have been like an inside
*  type job.
*  That he has publicly espoused, including name checking corporations.
*  And also with like BlackRock, they're one of the top three shareholders in 88% of the
*  companies in America.
*  BlackRock got mentioned to us by several people.
*  Interesting.
*  When they're that big of a shareholder, they're sitting down with the executives of these
*  companies and saying this is what you're going to do or we're going to sell our shares.
*  And that conspiratorial mindset really does inform a lot of his supporters.
*  And then we spoke to people from both parties who really just hate the idea of a repeat
*  of the last election.
*  And in fact, see that likely match up as a sign that the system needs some fresh blood
*  and to be shaken up a little bit.
*  Do you think if he were not running, would you cast a vote in the upcoming presidential
*  election?
*  No, there isn't a candidate in my mind.
*  Although it's tempting to vote for Trump to get rid of Biden, but that wouldn't work.
*  It would just be trading one monster for another monster.
*  So I'm done with the monster thing, you know?
*  So what you're describing makes me think of him and I want you to tell me if this is right
*  as kind of a catchall for Americans who are alienated from our politics and a lot of Americans
*  are.
*  Those who have gone down the rabbit hole of this internet era and are drawn to theories
*  about the government and corporations and who's really pulling the strings and those
*  who just love the idea of a Kennedy back in the mix and taken together, I have to imagine
*  that could be a fair number of people.
*  Right.
*  And that cross section that you just described includes people who voted for Donald Trump
*  in 2016 and 2020 or who sat out 2020 after being disillusioned after the 2016 election.
*  And that really gets us to the question of who has more to fear here, the Democrats or
*  the Republicans?
*  Right, because his appeal, as you have laid bare, is really bipartisan.
*  Yeah, it's a bipartisan, almost anti-partisan appeal.
*  Nonpartisan, anti-partisan.
*  Nonpartisan.
*  And it was really telling to me and to my colleagues in the politics team that about
*  an hour before he started his speech declaring independence, the Republican National Committee
*  put out an email saying 23 reasons not to vote for R.F.K.
*  Jr.
*  And that sort of just tells you something, right, that they are already seeing him as
*  potential threat to Donald Trump or to the potential nominee.
*  And they're describing him as pretty much a rank-and-file Democrat in all but name.
*  But the fact that they put it out there...
*  To which there's a little bit of truth because he just was one.
*  To which there's a little bit of truth.
*  But it means they're afraid of him as a challenger to a Republican.
*  Right.
*  And of course, fear him too because the feeling is that the incumbent has more to lose here
*  when there's the presence of a third party or independent candidate.
*  So there's genuine uncertainty and a lot of interest in which side Kennedy will be helping
*  or hurting.
*  Right.
*  So, look, as an independent candidate, he faces a tremendous uphill battle getting on
*  the ballot in all 50 states.
*  Right.
*  It has to get the signature that's a whole rigmarole.
*  Right.
*  And he has its own rules and it's a huge endeavor.
*  But he doesn't even have to get on the ballot in all 50 states to be a spoiler because really
*  what it comes down to or what it's likely to come down to is tens of thousands of votes
*  in a few critical swing states.
*  Right.
*  Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona.
*  Michigan, Pennsylvania.
*  And if in those states he's able to pull votes away or even cause people not to vote at all,
*  that makes him a spoiler and that could have significant ramifications for the election.
*  And that is truly what both parties are worried about.
*  I think at this point they're not quite worried that he's going to win the presidency.
*  It's a fear that he will do just enough at the margins and just enough at the right margins
*  to swing the results one way or another.
*  Rebecca, thank you very much.
*  Thank you very much.
*  The Democrats are frightened that I'm going to spoil the election for President Biden.
*  And the Republicans are frightened that I'm going to spoil it for President Trump.
*  The truth is they're both right.
*  My intention is to spoil it for both of them.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Wednesday, Israel formed an emergency government that will sideline political hardliners and
*  incorporate two new ministers, both former army chiefs, as the country prepares for
*  what could be a drawn-out war with Hamas in response to its massacre of 1,200 Israelis
*  over the weekend.
*  In a speech announcing the new government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that,
*  quote, every member of Hamas is a dead man.
*  In Gaza, where Israel is launching airstrikes aimed at Hamas, more than 1,100 Palestinians
*  have been killed.
*  Local officials said that Israel is targeting buildings that are normally off-limits, including
*  schools, hospitals, and mosques.
*  And House Republicans have nominated their Majority Leader, Representative Steve Scalise
*  of Louisiana, as their next speaker.
*  But it's unclear whether he has sufficient support to actually win the job during a vote
*  on the House floor.
*  Scalise can only afford to lose the votes of four fellow Republicans, but so far, seven
*  of them have said they will not support him.
