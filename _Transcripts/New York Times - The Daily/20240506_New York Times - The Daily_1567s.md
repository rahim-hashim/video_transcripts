# R.F.K. Jr.â€™s Battle to Get on the Ballot
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIdfuBddho)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Today, as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tries to get on the presidential ballot in all 50 states,
*  he's confronting fierce resistance from his rivals.
*  My colleague, Rebecca Davis O'Brien, has been reporting on the high stakes battle, playing
*  out behind the scenes.
*  It's Monday, May 6th.
*  Rebecca, when we last spoke with you, which was in the fall, about what's really become
*  your beat these days, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign, he had just made this
*  very important decision to drop out of the Democratic primary, which he decided he couldn't
*  run as an independent, but very much unresolved at that moment was whether as an independent
*  candidate without the infrastructure of a major party, he could really mount a serious
*  campaign. So what has happened since then?
*  Right. So you might remember that when Kennedy began his campaign, I've come here today to
*  announce my candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States.
*  Back in April of 2023, he was really sort of a protest candidate.
*  They close every business in this country for a year.
*  Who was still really within the Democratic Party, but was pointing out, as he had been
*  during the pandemic, some of the problems with the pandemic response.
*  As we all now recognize, the COVID vaccines were neither safe nor effective.
*  His skepticism of the COVID vaccine, his skepticism about childhood vaccination schedules.
*  I can make the argument that President Biden has a much worse threat to democracy.
*  His dissatisfaction with how President Biden had done his job.
*  But it was really more of a niche audience.
*  And when he left the Democratic Party and decided to run as an independent in October,
*  he had to create a bigger audience for himself, a bigger platform and stake out kind of a
*  broader claim on the American electorate.
*  And how did he do that?
*  Well, you could hear it immediately in his speech back in October.
*  I'm here to declare myself an independent candidate.
*  When he was saying I declare my independence, I hope to be at the forefront of a movement
*  of the independent voter in the United States.
*  This country is ready for a history making change.
*  The broad thrust of his argument is that the current political system dominated by the
*  Republican and Democratic Party is no longer working for Americans.
*  We've seen the Democratic, both the Democratic and the Republican Party turn against the
*  values that they traditionally represented for our country.
*  And so many of us feel homeless today.
*  So he started that really in October.
*  And since then, he's been taking this message of declaring independence for himself and
*  trying to scoop up, draw in as many voters from across the country who also, like him,
*  disaffected or not represented by either the Democratic or Republican parties that he sees
*  as a kind of corrupt, stale duopoly.
*  Let's go take back our country.
*  God bless you and God bless the United States of America.
*  So Kelly's very much taking this identity, it sounds like as an independent, which was in
*  a way a political necessity, and he's turning it into an animating identity for his
*  campaign and one that he hopes will be appealing to people across the political spectrum, not
*  just independents, but Democrats and Republicans.
*  That's exactly right. And part of that effort is staying in the new cycle and staying
*  relevant. So we saw that earlier this year when there was this big seven million dollar ad
*  paid for by a super PAC supporting Kennedy.
*  Seven million dollars.
*  Seven million dollars.
*  A huge expenditure on a single ad.
*  A huge expenditure for a 30 second spot during the Super Bowl.
*  And what was interesting about this ad and caught a lot of viewers' attention.
*  Was that it was a repurposed presidential campaign ad from 1960 for John F.
*  Kennedy, who was, of course, his uncle.
*  Right.
*  And they kind of swapped out some of the images in there that had been of JFK's face.
*  When he used the famous jingle that I think all of us know, even if we weren't born in the
*  1960s, which is the Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy.
*  I'm glad you sang that.
*  America's got a 2024 is responsible for the content of this advertisement.
*  The ad was successful in generating a lot of news coverage and keeping Kennedy in the
*  news for another few days after the Super Bowl.
*  At the time, the head of the super PAC that bought it explained that the idea behind it
*  was to get more people to realize that he was still running for president.
*  Which it did.
*  It did. Right.
*  And he follows that ad up a month later with the announcement of his vice presidential
*  running mate. And she is a pretty unknown figure.
*  She is a Silicon Valley lawyer and investor.
*  Her name is Nicole Shanahan.
*  And why does he pick her?
*  Well, in addition to sharing some of his political views, he picks her because she has a
*  lot of money. She used to be married to Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google.
*  Some estimates out there that she's worth billions of dollars and she can help fund
*  this campaign. This is all happening as his campaign and its allies are mounting this
*  huge concerted effort that's essential to the survival of his candidacy, which is getting
*  on the ballot in all 50 states.
*  Now, they've been working on this behind the scenes since the moment he left the Democratic
*  Party. But it's not until early 2024 that a legal effort, a signature gathering effort,
*  all these things that have to happen and which cost a lot of money start to really come
*  together. And that's happening as he's making this big public splash.
*  OK, so how does it go trying to get actually on the ballot?
*  So let me just start by saying getting on the ballot is a state by state scramble.
*  And critical to these efforts in basically every state is getting thousands of signatures.
*  If you're an independent candidate, you have to get, in some cases, tens of thousands of
*  signatures from voters under very specific circumstances.
*  Each state has its own specific rules for gathering signatures.
*  Deadlines.
*  Deadlines. And there are certain windows you can use to gather signatures.
*  There are rules about who can gather the signatures and where.
*  So it's very complicated and time consuming and expensive process.
*  But here is where Kennedy has had success so far.
*  He got on the ballot in Utah.
*  He got on the ballot in Hawaii.
*  And a big moment happened a few weeks ago when he announced that he was on the ballot in
*  Michigan. And Michigan really matters because it's a critical swing state in this
*  election. It went for Trump in 2016.
*  It went for Biden in 2020.
*  And both of the campaigns see this as a must win for their success this fall.
*  And so for the Biden and Trump campaigns, Kennedy getting on the ballot in Michigan
*  is the moment when they see the threat of a spoiler, because all of a sudden they see
*  that even if he doesn't win, if he's able to draw enough voters from either of them to
*  tip the balance in the favor of the other, that kind of margin could really make an
*  impact on the whole election.
*  Right. And RFK, if we're being honest, is unlikely to tip the scales in the two previous
*  states you mentioned, Utah and Hawaii.
*  Utah is a bright red state.
*  Hawaii is a bright blue state.
*  Michigan would be the place where if he were going to play the spoiler, he would play
*  the spoiler.
*  Right. And the story of how he got on the ballot in Michigan is kind of a fascinating
*  one.
*  Please tell us.
*  So rather than go through this whole arduous process of gathering thousands of signatures,
*  the campaign found a kind of back door to getting on the ballot line through a very
*  obscure party called the Natural Law Party.
*  Never heard of it.
*  It is essentially a two member party based only in Michigan, sustained truly by this
*  guy who has a small law firm an hour west of Detroit.
*  He is the chairman of the Natural Law Party.
*  And back in January, he happened to be watching TV and saw RFK and he thought to himself,
*  now that's a guy who would be a natural candidate for the Natural Law Party.
*  The Natural Law Party has kind of a varied platform that includes supporting transcendental
*  meditation and environmental stewardship.
*  And the very next day, he got an email from the Kennedy Campaigns ballot access director
*  expressing interest in being the party's nominee.
*  And fast forward to April, he is having a two person convention in his offices an hour
*  west of Detroit and they nominate Kennedy to be the Natural Law Party candidate.
*  OK, I just want to make sure I have this all correct.
*  Robert F.
*  Kennedy Jr.
*  gets on to the ballot in this key swing state of Michigan by a convention of two people
*  in a law office.
*  And that's it.
*  That's it.
*  That's the back door.
*  That's the back door.
*  No signatures, no fuss.
*  And Michigan's really a watershed moment for Kennedy and for the rest of the political
*  establishment because it's the moment when his candidacy goes from being an abstract
*  threat to a concrete one.
*  So as Kennedy tries to replicate that success across the rest of the country and get on
*  other states ballots, the Republican and Democratic parties realize that they have to
*  deal with him.
*  There's no avoiding him.
*  And so Kennedy's effort to get on the ballot in every state is turning into a pitched
*  battle.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Rebecca, tell us about what's becoming a pitched battle over R.F.K.
*  Jr.'s access to the ballot.
*  And I'm curious which of the two parties, Democrats and Republicans, seems to be fighting
*  him the hardest.
*  The Democratic Party has definitely come out of the gates with the most aggressive concern
*  about Kennedy's candidacy.
*  And why is that?
*  Well, I think the answer to that is that third party and independent candidates have
*  haunted the Democratic Party in presidential cycles in recent years.
*  There's sort of the ghost of Ralph Nader and Jill Stein lurking there.
*  Ralph Nader, of course, seen as someone who might have influenced Al Gore's loss to
*  George W.
*  Bush.
*  Right.
*  In 2000.
*  And then Jill Stein and the Green Party drew, I think, more than 30,000 votes in
*  Wisconsin in 2016.
*  And that was widely seen as part of the reason why Hillary Clinton fell short there.
*  So this is the fear, basically, of Kennedy as spoiler for the Democrats.
*  Right.
*  This is the fear that Kennedy could get just enough votes to tip the election in swing
*  states to Donald Trump.
*  So that's the broad underlying fear.
*  There's a specific fear here, which is that the Democratic Party sees that Donald Trump's
*  support has a high floor.
*  Right.
*  It's going to be very hard to peel voters away from the hardcore Trump base.
*  Right.
*  On the other hand, Biden has a sort of softer base of support.
*  There's an enthusiasm sort of deficit there, especially among young voters.
*  And the concern is that a third party candidate could draw people away from the
*  margins from him, especially in swing states.
*  And Michigan in particular is a pressure point for the Democrats and Biden because we
*  saw during the Democratic primary there, there was a protest vote stemming from
*  disaffection over his handling of the Israel-Gaza war.
*  Right.
*  And it was a historic rebuke of Biden from what had been traditionally a
*  Democratic base, Arab Americans in Michigan.
*  Right.
*  He and his campaign saw the potential for a portion of his base to kind of go rogue
*  and not vote for him.
*  So Michigan encapsulates why RFK poses a threat to Biden because the Democratic
*  base right now is sort of restive.
*  And in the mind of the Biden campaign and the Democratic Party, they want to keep
*  this election about Donald Trump versus Joe Biden.
*  They don't want there to be an opportunity for Democratic voters to take somebody
*  else's box, especially not at Kennedy, not only in Michigan, but in all these other
*  swing states in Georgia, in North Carolina, in Nevada, in Arizona.
*  Every single person whose name is not Joe Biden or Donald Trump is a risk for Joe
*  Biden in the mind of the Democratic Party.
*  Right.
*  And the reason the Kennedy name is a specific threat is it's the most powerful
*  name, perhaps besides Clinton, in the history of a Democratic Party.
*  Right.
*  And even though he's not a Democrat up and down his policy platforms, he has a lot
*  of positions that would probably appeal to Democrats.
*  So he's pro-choice, he's pro-union, and he has a long history of supporting
*  environmental stewardship.
*  Okay.
*  So what is Biden and the Democratic Party doing to try to fend off what they clearly
*  see as a threat of RFK Jr.
*  getting on all of these swing state ballots and really all the ballots around the
*  country?
*  Right.
*  So heading into this ballot access push, the Biden campaign, the Democratic Party,
*  and some of the affiliated super PACs who are backing his reelection effort have gone
*  sort of in an all out legal assault on the Kennedy campaign and on third party ballot
*  access generally.
*  So broadly speaking, this means having a legal team based in Washington, D.C., but
*  with tentacles all over the states, and they have been monitoring aggressively the
*  ballot access efforts as they kind of emerge state by state.
*  So, for example, one thing that emerged late last year is that a super PAC backing
*  Kennedy pledged to spend up to 15 million dollars to help them get on the ballot in
*  some critical swing states.
*  And immediately, the Democratic Party went into action and filed a complaint with the
*  Federal Election Commission saying you can't do that, that's coordination.
*  So they immediately...
*  Illegal coordination between the campaign and the super PAC.
*  Right.
*  So a super PAC, which can raise unlimited amounts of money and spend it at will,
*  they're not supposed to coordinate with the campaign.
*  And the argument of the Democratic Party was there's literally no way that a super PAC
*  could help a candidate get on the ballot without coordination that's illegal.
*  Interesting.
*  And indeed, that super PAC, having announced that it had gotten enough signatures in a
*  number of swing states, then backed off that effort publicly.
*  So a successful legal intervention by the Democrats.
*  So far.
*  Yes, it seems so.
*  So that's a successful legal intervention on a national level.
*  But we've also seen pushback against the Kennedy campaign from Democratic secretaries
*  of state and elections officials in a number of states.
*  So in Nevada, for example, earlier this year, they signed a petition and gathered more
*  than 15,000 signatures to get him on the ballot as an independent.
*  And then the secretary of state, who is a Democrat, said, it looks like you might have
*  done this wrong.
*  And of course, the Kennedy campaign cried foul, they're threatening legal action, and
*  that is likely to play out in federal court sometime soon.
*  But clearly this is the kind of thing that the Biden campaign and the Democrats nationally
*  would encourage local Democrats to do on their behalf.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, even without the explicit pressure from the Democratic Party, this is exactly
*  what they're hoping will happen.
*  Is that Democratic secretaries of state and these elections officials will push back
*  against efforts to get on the ballot that are maybe not coloring within the lines
*  strictly by the letter of the law.
*  So it sounds like from the top of the Democratic Party all the way down to local
*  Democratic officials, everyone who can find a lever of power that would throw a wrench
*  in RFK Jr.'s ballot access is doing so.
*  And I'm curious how much of that feels like kind of the standard playbook that a major
*  party uses in a presidential race and how much stands out as unusually aggressive.
*  The Democratic Party would say they're just enforcing the rules and that local officials
*  are doing their job.
*  But of course, the Kennedy campaign sees this as a profoundly anti-democratic exercise
*  and example of like how the party is trying to stifle his efforts to get on the ballot
*  corruptly.
*  And so this would seem to explain, right, why the Kennedy campaign is resorting to
*  tactics like we saw in Michigan, where, as you just told us, they get on the ballot using
*  this obscure party with two members.
*  The Kennedy folks, in their minds, are waging kind of electoral guerrilla warfare.
*  To get around these roadblocks that the Democrats are putting up.
*  That's right.
*  OK, so that's the Democrats.
*  What are the Republicans and former President Trump doing about RFK Jr.'s efforts to
*  get on the ballot?
*  You had told us that Democrats are the more aggressive party in trying to combat
*  Kennedy's candidacy.
*  But how are the Republicans thinking about the role that he might play in this
*  presidential race?
*  So the Republican Party and Donald Trump have been on an interesting journey with
*  Kennedy since he became an independent candidate.
*  On the one hand, on paper, you can actually see how a candidate like Kennedy poses a
*  unique threat to Trump.
*  He's sort of an anti-establishment voice.
*  He says what's on his mind, for better or worse.
*  He's pro-gun rights.
*  He is anti-vaccine.
*  He speaks to a certain contrarian segment of the Republican base, actually.
*  Sounds a bit like Trump.
*  It sounds a bit like Trump.
*  And yet, over the past few months, the Republicans seem to have not been as concerned
*  as you might expect.
*  The Republican Party actually seemed to embrace Kennedy's candidacy for precisely the
*  same reasons that the Democrats are so worried about him.
*  They're looking at the same history of third party candidates and saying, great, it
*  will temper the votes for Joe Biden and pave the way for President Trump's reelection.
*  And so various arms of their Republican Party and Trump's campaign had devised various
*  ways to help prop Kennedy up and paint him as a liberal in an effort to draw voters
*  away from Biden.
*  So, for example, some people aligned with the Trump campaign had floated the idea of
*  using dark money groups to put up billboards in Michigan praising Kennedy's pro-choice
*  stance as sort of a way to say like, oh, here's another liberal alternative, Michigan
*  voters. Got it.
*  And elsewhere, people who are aligned with the Trump campaign have publicly offered to
*  help gather signatures for the third party and independent candidates.
*  And this is part of like a broad dark ops effort to prop up these candidates who both
*  Democrats and Republicans have sort of thought would be more of a threat to Democrats.
*  Right. So this is the philosophy that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
*  Thus, R.F.K.
*  Jr. as an enemy to Joe Biden should be a friend to the Trump campaign.
*  Exactly. But then, you know, as I said, this has been a journey.
*  And in the past few days, we've seen sort of a reversal and sort of maybe Trump seeing
*  Kennedy as a threat to his own candidacy.
*  So on Truth Social, his social media platform, the other day, he described Kennedy as a
*  Democrat plant who has been put in place to help Joe Biden win re-election.
*  He said voting for quote unquote Jr.
*  would be a wasted protest vote.
*  It was almost out of nowhere, the sort of broadside against Kennedy.
*  And do we know why Trump has concluded that the previous thinking about Kennedy as
*  potentially an ally in hurting Biden is no longer the right course?
*  We don't know why. I mean, we can surmise that there have been internal polls that
*  might have suggested that Kennedy can draw equally from Donald Trump.
*  But the Kennedy folks are proud of this because they say that they do draw from both
*  sides. And, you know, if you talk to Kennedy volunteers, some of them have voted for
*  Trump in the past.
*  Interesting. So I do think we're going to likely see a rhetorical shift and sort of
*  a changing posture towards Kennedy in particular, because now, evidently, Trump and
*  the Republicans see his candidacy as a threat to them as well.
*  It strikes me, Rebecca, that there's some real risk for both Biden and Trump in
*  going after R.F.K. Jr., whether that's through the legal tactics we've been talking
*  about on the Democratic side and so far the rhetorical approach that the Republicans
*  are taking, because Kennedy is casting himself as an alternative to the entrenched
*  duopoly, to quote him, of these two big party machines.
*  And so attacking him and specifically trying to keep him off the ballot might strongly
*  reinforce that image and potentially galvanize support for him.
*  Right.
*  When I speak to people inside the Kennedy campaign, they constantly marvel at two
*  things. One is that the Democratic Party repeatedly makes itself look profoundly
*  undemocratic by, in their minds, sort of corruptly blocking their access to the ballot.
*  And the other thing is that the Republican Party just seems to see them as a puppet.
*  Right. So these kinds of attacks from the Democrats and Republicans play right into
*  his narrative about how he is rising above the two party system.
*  And he can now turn to these efforts and say, look, they're trying to keep me off the
*  ballot in these states and they're attacking me as super liberal, but they're also
*  attacking me as super conservative.
*  And he's done exactly that. He sort of chuckles at them and says, this is why you
*  should come with me, because I care about the American people and these two parties
*  are too busy attacking me to do what they need to do, which is lead the country.
*  So I think that as he continues to mount this ballot access state by state, the
*  Republicans and the Democrats, especially as he sees more success, which I think will
*  happen, they have to make a decision.
*  Is it worth it for them financially or sort of in the big picture to make it so that
*  voters can't vote for him or to make a case for why they shouldn't vote for him?
*  Right. I think that's sort of the crux here.
*  Right. Is it like ballot access or is it about the issues?
*  Right. Do Republicans and Democrats let voters choose Kennedy or do they say you
*  have no choice?
*  Right. And does depriving you of the choice to vote for Kennedy make him stronger?
*  Rebecca, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The latest round of ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas held in Cairo hit
*  an impasse on Sunday that prompted the delegation from Hamas to leave the talks.
*  Meanwhile, how dire is the humanitarian crisis on the ground right now in Gaza?
*  What I can explain to you is that there is famine, full blown famine in the north and
*  it's moving its way south.
*  The leader of the United Nations World Food Program, Cindy McCain, said that parts of
*  Gaza are experiencing a famine that is spreading across the territory because of the
*  Israeli military operation occurring there.
*  Finally, Israel said that it would shut down the Israeli operations of Al Jazeera, the
*  Qatari-based TV network that is a major source of news in the Arab world and has
*  frequently highlighted civilian suffering in Gaza during the war.
*  Israel accused Al Jazeera of harming its national security and inciting violence
*  against its soldiers.
*  In response, Al Jazeera called the shutdown order a criminal act.
