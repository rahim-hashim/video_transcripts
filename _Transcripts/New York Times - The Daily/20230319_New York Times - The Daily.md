# The Sunday Read: ‘Spirited Away to Miyazaki Land’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_rFFyXB30)
*  I grew up going to what I think of as very American theme parks. Roller coasters everywhere,
*  bright lights, carnival games, overpriced food, entertainment literally in every direction you
*  look. I guess I always just think of it as this big festival of capitalism. And that felt very
*  natural to me, and I just assumed that every place in the world was like that. So when I
*  went to this new theme park in Japan, it really flipped all those expectations upside down.
*  Hi, my name is Sam Anderson, and I'm a staff writer for the New York Times magazine.
*  For this week's Sunday read, I'll be reading my article for the February 19, 2023 issue of
*  the magazine about a trip I took to a new Japanese theme park. It's called Ghibli Park. It's a long
*  awaited celebration of the legendary animation of Studio Ghibli, which is run by Hayao Miyazaki
*  and some others. I've been imagining this theme park for a long time as I've been watching these
*  films. And I have to say, I always expected it to be strange, but it was much stranger
*  than I ever could have imagined. So here's my article from the February 19, 2023 issue of the
*  New York Times magazine. As an American, I know what it feels like to arrive at a theme park.
*  The totalizing, consumerist embrace. The blunt force, world warping, escapist delight.
*  I have known theme parks with entrance gates like International Borders, and ticket prices
*  like mortgage payments, and parking lots the size of Cleveland. I have been to Disney World,
*  an alternate reality that basically occupies its own tax zone, with its own fire department,
*  and its own agriculture. A place where before you've even entered, you see a 100 foot tall
*  electrical pole along the freeway with Mickey Mouse ears. This is a theme park's job,
*  to swallow the universe, to replace our boring, aimless, frustrating world with a new one made
*  just for us. Imagine my confusion then, when I arrived at Ghibli Park,
*  Japan's long-awaited tribute to the legendary animation of Studio Ghibli.
*  Like filmgoers all over the world, I had been fantasizing about a visit to Ghibli Park
*  since the project was announced more than five years ago. I tracked the online rumors, inhaled
*  the concept drawings, scrutinized the maps. Ghibli's animation has always felt destined
*  to be turned into a theme park. Hayao Miyazaki, the studio's co-founder, is one of the all-time
*  great imaginary world builders, right up there with Lewis Carroll, Jim Henson, Ursula K. Le Guin,
*  Charles Schulz, Maurice Sendak, and composers of the Icelandic sagas.
*  Even Miyazaki's most fantastical creations—a castle with giant metal chicken legs,
*  a yellow bus with the body of a cat—feel somehow thick and plausible and real.
*  Miyazaki started Studio Ghibli in 1985 out of desperation, when he and his co-founders,
*  Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki, couldn't find a studio willing to put out their work.
*  The films were brilliant, but notoriously artsy, expensive, labor-intensive. Miyazaki is
*  maniacally detail-obsessed. He agonizes over his children's cartoons, as if he were Michelangelo
*  painting the Sistine Chapel. He will pour whole oceans of effort and time and money into the
*  smallest effects—the way a jumping fish twists as it leaps, individual faces in a crowd reacting
*  to an earthquake, the physics of tiles during a rooftop chase scene. Miyazaki insists that,
*  although few viewers will be conscious of all this work, every viewer will feel it. And we do.
*  Those tiny touches adding up across the length of a film anchor his fantasies in the actual world.
*  Ghibli is an Italian word, derived from Arabic, for a hot wind that blows across Libya. The plan
*  was for the company to blow like a hot wind through the stagnant world of animation. It succeeded.
*  For more than 35 years, Studio Ghibli has been the great eccentric juggernaut of anime,
*  cranking out classic after odd classic. Castle in the Sky in 1986. My Neighbor Totoro in 1988.
*  Kiki's Delivery Service in 1989. Only Yesterday, 1991. Princess Mononoke in 1997. Spirited Away
*  in 2001. In Japan, the release of a new Ghibli film is a national event. In the studio's most
*  popular characters are ubiquitous. Plump Totoro. Mysterious No-Face. The Grinning Cat Bus.
*  Googly-eyed Soot Sprites. As a kind of shorthand, Miyazaki is often called the Walt Disney of Japan.
*  I was dying to see, in person, how a Ghibli theme park might work.
*  How could these surreal worlds possibly be translated into reality?
*  What would it feel like to lose ourselves inside them?
*  In November, when Ghibli Park finally opened, I made sure to get myself there. And so,
*  after many years and much traveling, at long last, I found myself stepping into the wonders
*  of Ghibli Park. Or did I? Did I find myself stepping into the wonders of Ghibli Park?
*  My first impression was not awe or majesty or surrender or consumerist bliss. It was confusion.
*  For a surprisingly long time after I arrived, I could not tell whether or not I had arrived.
*  There was no security checkpoint, no ticket booths, no ambient Ghibli soundtrack,
*  no mountainous cat bus statue. Instead, I found myself stepping out of a very ordinary train
*  station into what seemed to be a large municipal park. A sea of pavement. Sports fields. Vending
*  machines. It looked like the kind of place you might go on a lazy weekend to see a pretty good
*  softball tournament. There were some buildings around, but it was hard to tell which of them
*  might or might not be Ghibli related. In the distance, the arc of a Ferris wheel broke the
*  horizon. But this, I would discover, had nothing to do with Ghibli Park. I wandered into and out of
*  a convenience store. I saw some children wearing Totoro hats and started to follow them.
*  It felt like some kind of bizarre treasure hunt. A theme park where the theme was searching for the
*  theme park. Which was, in a way, perfectly Studio Ghibli. No pleasure without a little challenge.
*  And so, I headed down the hill, trying to find my way in.
*  Like many non-Japanese viewers, I first encountered Studio Ghibli through the 2001 film Spirited Away.
*  It is Miyazaki's masterpiece. A popular and critical super triumph that won the Oscar for
*  Best Animated Feature and became, for two decades, the highest grossing film in Japanese history.
*  Critics all over the world simultaneously fell out of their armchairs to praise it in the most
*  ecstatic possible terms. Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times rated it six out of five stars,
*  justifying this mathematical impossibility—exception must be made for the exceptional,
*  he wrote—with a flood of rapturous beat poetry.
*  What is the film about? It is about 122 minutes and 12 billion years. It sums up all existence
*  and gives us a mythology good for every society—a meable, animal, or human—that ever lived.
*  And he offered the ultimate existentialist blurb, rush now while life lasts.
*  I, on the other hand, am not a film critic. I am an ordinary American. Someone raised on MTV
*  and SNL and CGI, which means that my entertainment metabolism has been carefully
*  tuned to digest the purest visual corn syrup. Sarcastic men with large guns.
*  Yearning princesses with grumpy fathers. Explosive explosions explosively exploding.
*  When I watched Spirited Away, at first I had no idea what I was looking at.
*  In the simplest terms, the film tells the coming-of-age story of a 10-year-old girl
*  named Chihiro. It takes place in a haunted theme park where, almost immediately,
*  Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs, and Chihiro is forced to sign away her name and
*  perform menial labor in a bathhouse for ghosts. Ghosts, spirits, monsters, gods—it's hard to
*  know exactly what to call them, and the film never explains. A full plot summary would be
*  impossible. The story moves at a strange, tumbling pace, with elements connecting and separating and
*  floating around, revolving and recombining as if in a dream. But plot isn't really the point.
*  The majestic thing about Spirited Away is the world itself. Miyazaki's creativity is
*  radically dense. Every little molecule of the film seems charged with invention.
*  The haunted bathhouse attracts a proliferation of very weird beings. Giant yellow ducklings,
*  a sentient slime blob, fanged monsters with antlers, a humanoid radish spirit who appears
*  to be wearing an upside-down red bowl for a hat. There is a trio of green, disembodied heads
*  with black mustaches and angry faces who bounce around and pile up on top of one another and
*  grunt disapprovingly at Chihiro. There are so many creatures stuffed into so many nooks and crannies
*  that it seems as if Miyazaki has been spending multiple eternities on multiple planets,
*  running parallel evolutionary timelines, just so he can sketch the most interesting results.
*  As a viewer, you have to surrender to the abundance. Crowdsurf into the hallucination.
*  Miyazaki knows that his work can be difficult, and he is at all times righteously defiant.
*  I must say that I hate Disney's works, he once declared. The barrier to both the entry and exit
*  and exit of Disney films is too low and too wide. To me, they show nothing but contempt
*  for the audience. At home, Miyazaki is a celebrity, recognizable to the point of parody.
*  Caterpillar eyebrows, heavy dark-rimmed glasses, sculpted white beard, cigarette.
*  In 2019, the TV network NHK, Japan's rough equivalent to the BBC, aired a four-part
*  documentary chronicling Miyazaki's creative process. It is a festival of grouchy agony,
*  full of insults—he's not an adult yet, he says of his then-39-year-old son Goro—and self-reproach.
*  I feel like a comb with missing teeth, he says. Miyazaki is the curmudgeon's curmudgeon.
*  Over the decades, he has dismissed everything from iPads—disgusting—to 1980s Japanese animation,
*  resembles the food served on jumbo jet airliners, to art created by artificial intelligence.
*  I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.
*  Many artists have high standards. Miyazaki's are in outer space.
*  Disney is famously a vast corporate content farm, with all artistic choices carefully examined
*  by an assembly line of executives, marketers, focus groups, etc. Whereas Miyazaki's vision
*  is absolutely his own. Despite its global success, Studio Ghibli has remained quirky
*  and unpredictable, a direct reflection of the personalities of its founders. To this day,
*  Miyazaki insists on meticulously hand-drawing his own storyboards.
*  When his sketches go to Ghibli's larger team for the technical work of animation,
*  he checks every image. And if he sees something he dislikes, he will erase it and draw right over it,
*  explaining the whole time why it was wrong. For as long as he possibly could, Miyazaki resisted
*  computer animation. He still refuses, on principle, to make sequels. He has long told parents that
*  children should not watch his films more than once a year. Whatever experiences we provide them,
*  Miyazaki has said, are in a sense, stealing time from them that otherwise might be spent in a world
*  where they go out and make their own discoveries, or have their own personal experiences.
*  Miyazaki is now 82. He has tried multiple times, without success, to pass the creative torch.
*  I trained successors, but I couldn't let go, he once said. I devoured them. I devoured their talent.
*  That was my destiny. I ate them all. Even his elder son, Goro, has tried his hand at directing,
*  with mixed results. Miyazaki has abruptly retired, and then just as suddenly,
*  unretired, by my count, four times. He is currently finishing work on a new film titled,
*  How Do You Live? It is now in production and should be out in Japan this summer.
*  All of which raises some huge questions for Studio Ghibli. Questions so deep,
*  they're practically theological. What will happen to the company when the great Miyazaki
*  is gone? Can such idiosyncratic imaginative worlds outlive the mind that made them?
*  Would a theme park help, as it did for Walt Disney, to answer both of those questions?
*  Spirited Away is now more than 20 years old. Since that first confused encounter,
*  I have watched it many, many times. I still find it strange and scary and disorienting,
*  but also uplifting. Despite his crankiness, Miyazaki has always defined his artistic mission
*  in inspirational terms. I want to send a message of cheer to all those wandering aimlessly through
*  life he has written. So, when the real world gets bad, when I feel depressed, stressed,
*  misanthropic, crushed by politics or deadlines, I often find myself stepping once more
*  into Chihiro's world. I find myself wanting to float around in Miyazaki's imagination,
*  as the spirits float in the herbal pools of the Spirited Away bathhouse.
*  I want to snuggle into the world of Ghibli like Totoro snuggling into a bed of ferns.
*  Do you recognize this? One of my Ghibli park guides asked me. I did. Of course I did.
*  We were staring at a big old-fashioned Japanese gate, red, with dark brown wood and a green tile
*  roof. It was a structure straight out of Spirited Away. Waiting on the other side,
*  framed perfectly in the doorway, was one of my favorite things in all of Miyazaki.
*  A squat stone statue, inscrutable and smiling. My guides were two friendly members of Ghibli's
*  PR team, Mai Sato and Seiko Wang. I met them up at the train station after I finished puttering
*  around the area lost. They confirmed that yes, I'd come to the right place. Unlike any theme park
*  I'd ever been to, Ghibli Park was located inside a larger park, Expo 2005 Aichi Commemorative Park.
*  And like a very polite house guest, it had tucked itself in without making much of a fuss.
*  Its signage was subtle and its attractions were spread around at great distances from one another.
*  The guides told me that our tour would take approximately four hours. As my body passed
*  through the Spirited Away gate, I felt a slight shimmering thrill. That smiling statue on the
*  other side was a spirit shrine, guardian of the other world. The first real sign in the film
*  that Chihiro's life is about to be transformed. As we approached, I wanted to stop and take a
*  selfie and text it to everyone I know. But other tourists were doing that and more people over to
*  the side were waiting politely for their turn. So the guides and I walked on. This is when we
*  entered the forest. If you want Miyazaki to love you, it might help to be a tree.
*  He has a well-documented reverence for nature. Rivers and mountains and oceans are practically
*  the heroes of many Ghibli films. Miyazaki's forests are so distinctive that certain mossy
*  shades of green automatically make me think of them. In fact, Miyazaki often compares storytelling
*  itself to a tree. It's not just about flashy ornamentation, he likes to say. It's about the
*  deep invisible roots that support the trunk that supports the branches, all of which in the end
*  allows you to hang the ornaments that everyone will admire.
*  Ghibli Park was designed, as the official website puts it, in close consultation with the surrounding
*  forest. My guides told me that, amazingly, not a single tree was cut down. Again, I thought of
*  Disney World, which was created at the expense of whole ecosystems, square miles denatured and
*  paved to make way for lucrative, user-friendly worlds of plastic and metal. Ghibli Park, by
*  contrast, is largely unchanged forest. Seeing its attractions involves walking endlessly through
*  wooded paths. Some of those paths are new or recently improved, but many seem old. The forest's
*  trees were thin and twisty. They stretched over our heads like sunlit hallways. They tangled off into
*  the distance. They just stood there, being trees. Staircases, wooden and stone, branched off up and
*  down hills. Without my guides, I would have had no idea where to go. As we walked, the American in me
*  kept wondering about lawsuits. Surely someone would someday trip on a route and fall down a staircase,
*  and wouldn't that person blame Ghibli Park? At one point, we saw a warning sign attached to a post
*  telling people to beware of snakes and hornets. It listed a phone number to call if you got into
*  trouble. Months before, in my first meeting with Studio Ghibli's PR team about a possible visit,
*  I was told that the studio would be happy to work with me, but had one serious concern. If the New
*  York Times published an article about Ghibli Park, they said, it might make more people want to come
*  visit. This struck them as a problem. Like many Ghibli products, Ghibli Park is impishly non-user
*  friendly. This is true for people in Japan and even more so for international visitors.
*  Consider, for instance, its location. Unlike Tokyo Disneyland or Universal Studios Japan
*  in Osaka, Ghibli Park is not located in a tourist hub. Instead, it sits on the outskirts of an
*  unglamorous city called Nagoya, in a region famous for being the home of Toyota, basically the Detroit
*  of Japan. And the park is not even in Nagoya proper. From my hotel in the center of the city,
*  it took me an hour and three different trains to reach Ghibli Park. The website suggests taking
*  the train because the park has no dedicated parking lot. The website also does its best to
*  lower expectations, declaring immediately, there are no big attractions or rides in Ghibli Park.
*  The surrounding grounds are public and free to walk around all day long.
*  There are only three paid areas in Ghibli Park, and by theme park standards, the admission fees
*  are laughably low, the equivalent of about $10 to $20 for each area. But tickets at that time
*  were nearly impossible to get. There was a lottery system, and they were sold out for months in
*  advance. Occasionally, my guides would lead me to a modest little statue. Do you recognize this,
*  they would ask? And it would be something from a Ghibli film. Sitting on a bench,
*  May's hat and ear of corn from my neighbor Totoro. Standing near a tree, a tanuki from
*  Pompoko. On a table, Sasuke's bucket from Ponyo. There are 15 of these objects, they told me,
*  scattered throughout the park. A little fan service scavenger hunt. I would pause,
*  identify the item, and take a photo. Other tourists would stop and do the same. And then
*  we would all keep walking through the trees. After a while, I told my guides, only half joking,
*  that Ghibli Park seemed like an extremely elaborate way to lure people out into the
*  middle of an obscure Japanese forest. Yes, they said, that is basically correct.
*  Studio Ghibli did not offer me an interview with Hayao Miyazaki. He was busy with his final film,
*  and he almost never agrees to do interviews anymore. Besides, they said, Ghibli Park was
*  not really his project. The man in charge was Goro, Hayao Miyazaki's son. In person, Goro Miyazaki is
*  almost the opposite of his father. Miyazaki the Elder is a spectacle, perpetually in motion,
*  smoking and agonizing and clutching his hair. He looks like a Miyazaki character. Goro, by contrast,
*  looks like an absolutely normal man. He is 56, clean shaven, slim. He sits still and speaks softly,
*  modestly, with none of his father's bombast. His eyes are like deep pools.
*  Goro and I met at Ghibli headquarters, a leafy compound designed by Hayao Miyazaki himself
*  that is spread over several blocks of a quiet Tokyo suburb. We sat in a meeting room featuring
*  shelves of animation books and statuettes of Ghibli characters. Goro arrived carrying multiple
*  large folders, his sketches and plans for Ghibli Park. The Miyazaki's father and son have what you
*  might call a fraught relationship. Both men have been surprisingly open about this. During Goro's
*  childhood, the great animator was mostly absent, cranking out masterpieces. The little boy got to
*  know his father like the rest of Japan by watching his films. I just wanted him to be there,
*  Goro says in the NHK documentary with great feeling. He feels alive only when he's making a film.
*  And then he adds, resigned, he can't change now. I owe that little boy an apology, Hayao Miyazaki says.
*  Goro, meanwhile, was raised by his mother, Akimi Miyazaki. She taught him to love the outdoors.
*  They were always going hiking, and they spent summers up in her father's mountain cabin.
*  In high school, Goro joined the Mountaineering Club. In college, he studied forestry. After
*  graduation, he worked in landscape architecture. In his 30s, Goro led the construction of a quirky
*  little Ghibli museum in suburban Tokyo designed by his father, which opened in 2001. This is
*  something father and son could share, a reverence for nature. And Goro brought this reverence to
*  his design for Ghibli Park. There was a time when we considered making our own version of Disneyland,
*  he told me. Here's the Totoro area. People can ride the cat bus. That's great. But what about
*  the environment around it? After all, the action of my neighbor Totoro is inseparable from its
*  natural setting. Thick trees, grass fields, rice paddies. Totoro drops acorns everywhere as a kind
*  of calling card. To love Totoro is to love not just a single creature, but a whole habitat.
*  It doesn't feel right to have that kind of idyllic landscape in a theme park, Goro continued.
*  You can't have a rice field that's green all year round.
*  What about plastic, I asked. A plastic rice field contradicts the whole idea of Totoro's world,
*  he said. In Tokyo, I went to see Toshio Suzuki, the yin to Miyazaki's yang, the most important
*  person in the company's history, aside from Miyazaki and Takahata. Although he has held many
*  titles, producer, president, most crucially Suzuki has functioned as a kind of Miyazaki whisperer,
*  a combination of friend, critic, right-hand man, creative consultant, collaborator,
*  and business partner. When Miyazaki strains a major deadline, or decides out of nowhere to retire,
*  or when he can't decide how to end a film, Suzuki is the one who figures out how to make it all okay,
*  to stretch budgets and schedules, to hire or lay off whole teams of people.
*  I met Suzuki at his office, the doorway of which features a Totoro welcome mat. We sat together at
*  a long table, speaking through an interpreter. While Miyazaki is famously grouchy, Suzuki is
*  open and affable. He has a deep, hearty, easy laugh. He loves to talk, so much so that he hosts
*  his own weekly radio show. Suzuki told me that the story of Ghibli Park began, almost by accident,
*  20 years ago, with a quirky, one-off project. It was Suzuki's idea. For years, he had been
*  fantasizing about building a real-world simulacrum of the cartoon house from My Neighbor Totoro.
*  This was partly nostalgia. Suzuki actually grew up in Nagoya, in a house like that,
*  an old-style Japanese country house with traditional woodworking.
*  Finally, the real world gave him a perfect excuse. He learned that in 2005, a big world expo would
*  be held in this municipal park on the edge of Nagoya. Its organizers were inviting companies
*  from around the world, including Ghibli, to create pavilions. And so Suzuki said, yes,
*  we will build this house. The expo organizers loved the idea. Maybe you could put a Totoro in
*  the house, they said, or some of those cute little soot sprites. No, Suzuki said. In our interview,
*  he actually yelled this right out loud in English. No! He was only interested in building the house.
*  No characters. Nothing fantastical. Just the house. To this day, Suzuki is not sure why he
*  was so adamant about that. He insists it was not some great principled stand. He just felt like
*  saying no. When it came time to name the place, he didn't name it after Totoro. He named it after
*  the film's two human children, Satsuki and May's house. To build the house, Suzuki enlisted Goro.
*  Goro may not have had his father's animation genius. No one really did. But he had other things.
*  A similar obsession with detail. An iron will. Goro knew construction. He had a good practical
*  head on his shoulders. He'd built the Ghibli museum. He would be able to solve any logistical
*  problems. And he had people skills that his father lacked. The one thing that's very different from
*  Goro to his father, what sets them apart, is how they use staff members, Suzuki told me.
*  Hayao Miyazaki is maybe not a great leader. But Goro is very good at making the team function.
*  He's very good at bringing the best out of each team member.
*  The whole Totoro house project was a lark. Would the public even be interested in visiting an
*  elaborate wooden replica of a house from a cartoon? Suzuki had no idea. But popularity
*  wasn't really the point. The impulse was deeper than that. Well, it turned out that the public
*  was interested. In 2005, when the World Expo opened, Satsuki and May's house was an instant
*  sensation. Such huge floods of Miyazaki fans poured in that everyone worried the house would be ruined.
*  Its artisanal woodworking was not designed for so much traffic. They imposed a limit, 800 visitors
*  a day. But the competition for those 800 spots was so fierce that eventually the Expo instituted a
*  lottery system. On an average day, 600,000 people applied. Everyone in Japan seemed to want to put
*  their physical bodies inside the world of Studio Ghibli. Suzuki is still amazed by this. It was
*  just a house. When the Expo ended, he said, Ghibli received calls from all over Japan,
*  from north to south, Hokkaido to Okinawa. Everyone wanted Satsuki and May's house to be moved to
*  their city. Suzuki even received a call from the city of Toyoda, which was interested in moving the
*  house inside the car company's headquarters. What on earth was this insatiable hunger, I asked
*  Suzuki. Why would so many people go to so much trouble to stand inside an ordinary house?
*  It's an excellent question, he said. In fact, that's exactly what the head of Toyoda asked him.
*  Toyoda hoped that if they could figure out the source of this public frenzy,
*  it might help them sell their next car. But Suzuki had no good explanation.
*  And in the end, he told everyone that Satsuki and May's house would stay in Nagoya.
*  Many years later, this odd building would become the anchor and the guiding spirit of Ghibli Park.
*  Goro Started Planning Ghibli Park in 2017
*  It was similar to Satsuki and May's house, but much bigger, much more complicated. It would require
*  all of his skills. His ability to lead teams of actual humans. His ability to haul his father's
*  imaginary structures, kicking and screaming, into reality.
*  Building that Totoro house, Goro told me, had been an incredible hassle.
*  Architecturally, he discovered, the cartoon structure made very little sense.
*  It was tricky to come up with a design that would be both recognizable to viewers of My
*  Neighbor Totoro, while also functioning as a real-world house. The traditional woodworking
*  required a highly select group of artisans. They were proud, opinionated, and stubborn.
*  They argued with Goro over all kinds of things. The blueprints, the height of the ceilings.
*  They didn't want to build a temporary structure, so Goro had to promise to protect it,
*  even after the expo ended. Studio Ghibli had planned to paint the house when it was finished,
*  to make it look plausibly old. But the artisans hated that idea, and insisted on aging it in
*  their own way. Burning and rubbing the wood, lacquering it with persimmon juice.
*  To make everything worse, the expo's roads were blocked by construction, so carpenters had to drag
*  supplies over a hill. Everything took longer than it was supposed to. When the expo auditors saw
*  the expenses, they thought there had to be some mistake. It's not possible to spend so much money
*  on a single house, they said. We could have built a beautiful modern house for a fraction of this
*  cost. Nevertheless, Goro persisted. He overcame all the obstacles. He built the imaginary house.
*  Unfortunately, however, that triumph did not last. Because somehow, Goro agreed to step out
*  of the real world and into the world of his father. He agreed to direct a Studio Ghibli film.
*  It did not go well. Goro's film Tales from Earthsea lacked the energy that defined his father's work.
*  The throbbing physicality, the restless joy, the moral ambiguity. It was, to be blunt, stiff
*  and humorless. The villain cackled. The hero was noble. At a screening, Miyazaki walked out
*  after only an hour. It felt like I'd been in there for three hours, he said despondently
*  before reluctantly heading back in. All of this was captured in the NHK documentary.
*  Still, almost unbelievably, Goro went back for more. He proposed directing a second film.
*  In the end, after some more father-son fireworks, this one from Up on Poppy Hill was,
*  Thank the Forest Spirit, much better than his first.
*  And then came this huge undertaking of Ghibli Park. A theme park, in a way, had higher stakes
*  for Goro Miyazaki than any single film. This would be a public, physical, visitable,
*  globally anticipated translation of his father's imaginative worlds. And Goro would be absolutely
*  in charge. Eventually, after our very long walk through the forest, my guides and I arrived
*  at Satsuke and Mei's house. As an attraction, it is hilariously minimalist. Almost more conceptual
*  art about a theme park attraction than a proper attraction in itself. It's as if a giant hand
*  reached into the film, plucked just this building out, and set it down in a clearing in this forest.
*  We stepped inside. The house was clean, small, and crowded. Visitors had removed their shoes,
*  as if they were visiting a real person's home. And everyone was just doing house things. Opening
*  drawers, opening closets, turning faucets on and off. The place had been arranged with perfect
*  realism, as if a Japanese family actually lived there. Totami mats covered the floor, dishes
*  filled the cupboards. I slid open a closet. Nice actual blankets, folded neatly, sat on the shelves.
*  The bathroom had a big round tub, just like the one in the film. Outside, the yard featured a working
*  water pump. Pull the handle, watch it flow. There was not a single image of Totoro, the most beloved
*  of all the Studio Ghibli characters, the company's equivalent of Mickey Mouse. Nor could I find any
*  soot sprites. I stepped outside. On one side of the house, down at the ground, people were lining
*  up to peek into a dark hole. In the film, this is the portal through which Totoro emerges.
*  I got in line. Surely there would be a Totoro here. A pair of eyes, at least. Finally, I thought.
*  Ghibli Park had made me work for it, but I had found a Totoro. I waited my turn. I bent down.
*  The hole was empty.
*  When I told Goro about this experience, he seemed pleased.
*  We wanted to do something authentic, he said. Once you try to bring Totoro into reality,
*  you can only do it with a doll or a robot or someone dressed as Totoro. It would just lose
*  authenticity. I felt that it was more important to have the building give the feeling that Totoro
*  might be there. When you sit in that tatami room or if you look under the stairs, you feel like
*  he might be hiding. The most theme park-like area of Ghibli Park, the place that you will see all
*  over Instagram, is called Ghibli's Grand Warehouse. From the outside, it absolutely lives up to that
*  name. It is a big giant warehouse. Hulking, boxy, utilitarian. It looks as if it might contain a
*  municipal swimming pool, which in fact it once did. An identical building right next door still
*  contains an ice rink. Now the building is stuffed with Ghibliana, a dense bonanza of references and
*  tableaus and scale model buildings. It is colorful chaos. There are fountains and staircases and
*  bright mosaics with Ghibli's signature creatures worked into the patterns. There is a children's
*  play area featuring Totoro and a giant cat bus. There is a grand old-fashioned theater that plays
*  charming short films never released in theaters. I saw one about a group of preschoolers who
*  imagined their way out onto the open sea where they lasso a smiling whale. The Grand Warehouse's
*  main draw was an exhibition called Wonderfully. Exhibition, Becoming Characters in Memorable
*  Ghibli Scenes. It is a series of life-sized tableaus from beloved Studio Ghibli films into
*  which visitors can insert themselves. You can run on top of a giant fish with Ponyo,
*  pose with a robot from Castle in the Sky, enter the cluttered clubhouse in from up on Poppy Hill,
*  or stand with the hunters from Princess Mononoke. Or, the most popular choice,
*  you can sit on the train next to No-Face. Let's pause here briefly to make sure we all
*  fully appreciate No-Face. The very best Miyazaki characters, the ones that hit on the deepest
*  spiritual levels, are the ones that do not speak. Totoro, the cat bus, Soot Sprites,
*  Kodama, the little rattle-headed forest spirits in Princess Mononoke. And the greatest of all these,
*  one of the great strange miracles in the history of cinema, is No-Face. No-Face
*  is a lonely ghost who appears out of thin air in the middle of Spirited Away. He is so simple and
*  deep, so eloquently silent, that it is hard to even describe him. Words themselves hesitate.
*  This, in fact, is partly what No-Face is about, the failure of language. He speaks in incoherent
*  monosyllables. Ehh, ehh, ehh. Tender little noises that nudge their way toward language,
*  but never quite get there. And yet his sounds are full of feeling, full of all that wants to be
*  expressed, but can't. No-Face, in other words, is quintessential Miyazaki. In a 2002 interview,
*  Roger Ebert told Miyazaki he loved the, quote, gratuitous motion in his films. The way sometimes
*  people will just sit for a moment, or sigh, or gaze at a running stream, or do something extra,
*  not to advance the story, but only to give the sense of time and place and who they are.
*  To which Miyazaki responded,
*  We have a word for that in Japanese. It's called ma, emptiness. It's there intentionally.
*  Miyazaki clapped his hands.
*  No-Face is a character so minor that he becomes extremely major. His body is a big black swoop.
*  His face is a white mask in which the eyes and mouth are just black holes. No-Face's body
*  is semi-transparent, so you can actually see the background right through him.
*  This was the one experience I absolutely wanted to have at Ghibli Park, the thing I had been
*  fantasizing about from thousands of miles away. To sit next to No-Face. I wanted to enter Miyazaki's
*  most iconic scene. No-Face sitting expressionless on a red velvet seat on an ethereal train near
*  the end of Spirited Away. I needed to sit there with him. To put my real 3D body next to his fake
*  3D body. I needed to feel that I was gliding over the water, lonely but not alone, on his sad,
*  hopeful journey. Unfortunately, this turned out not to be possible. Everyone else in Japan
*  seemed to have come to Ghibli Park to take this photo. The line seemed infinite. My guides
*  simply acknowledged that, given the time constraints of our tour, the wait would be too long.
*  They did not offer even for a second to let me cut the line, which I appreciated, because I almost
*  certainly would have done it, thereby violating the whole anti-greed ethos of Spirited Away.
*  As a consolation, my guides took my photo in a different tableau. This one with a very short
*  line. It was the climactic scene from Porco Rosso, Miyazaki's story of an Italian pig pilot.
*  This is not one of my favorite Ghibli films, but I would take what I could get.
*  In the tableau, a huge crowd cheers as Porco, his face battered and swollen, throws a punch.
*  I stepped into the fight, tilting my body to absorb Porco's punch, pretending to punch him back.
*  It felt completely ridiculous. The PR team took my photo. It looks as ridiculous as I felt.
*  I left the Grand Warehouse feeling, I have to say, mildly disappointed. I had not sat with no face,
*  nor had I enjoyed the concession stand that offers, as the website puts it,
*  "'local milk in a glass bottle with an original design.'" There was another infinite line.
*  Despite all its color, the Grand Warehouse felt static, plastic, a little anti-climactic,
*  unlike in Ghibli's films, nothing moved. Part of me, again the American part, had been expecting
*  to be shocked, entertained, thrown around. It was hard to imagine Hayao Miyazaki, the genius
*  world builder, the man obsessed with motion, building a place so oddly still. He would have
*  built a rollicking theme park. In fact, Toshio Suzuki told me, that had once been his plan.
*  Not many people knew this, Suzuki said, but a long time ago, Hayao Miyazaki went to Disneyland,
*  and he loved it. He kept it to himself, Suzuki said. He never said that at home,
*  that he had fun at Disneyland, but I know what happened. In fact, Miyazaki had so much fun
*  that he came back to Japan dreaming of building a theme park of his own. He sketched secret plans
*  of Ghibli-themed roller coasters. Suzuki saw them, but these plans never came to pass.
*  Goro wasn't interested. The Grand Warehouse, Goro told me, was motionless by design.
*  He felt that even the most advanced theme park effects, rides, virtual reality, could never
*  compare with the experience of watching Studio Ghibli's films. So he didn't even try. The absence
*  of attractions, the lack of motion in the Grand Warehouse, it was all perfectly intentional.
*  It's the visitors that create the motion, he said. The characters don't move, so the visitors have
*  to move themselves. People get very creative interacting with the scenes, whether you enjoy
*  it or not, and how you enjoy it is up to you, and I think that is more Ghibli-esque.
*  A couple of weeks before it opened, Miyazaki visited Ghibli Park.
*  Toshio Suzuki went with him. Goro gave them a tour.
*  The park, Miyazaki said, was something that I wouldn't have come up with myself.
*  He looked a little lonely, Suzuki told me, maybe thinking that his time was up.
*  My favorite experience of Ghibli Park, the most Ghibli Park experience of all, came at the very
*  end. It involved no lines, no merch, no Miyazaki characters, and yet somehow it felt steered or
*  framed or made possible by Miyazaki. Back at the train station after my tour, I said goodbye to my
*  guides. Then I turned and walked over the sea of concrete back down the hill, past the grand
*  warehouse, through the spirited away gate, and I followed the path back into the forest.
*  The forest was, after all, the whole point of this park, its inspiration,
*  the thing that father and son could always absolutely agree on.
*  I plunged into the trees and started wandering at random.
*  The forest was not, like so many of the forests in Miyazaki's films, ancient and primeval.
*  It was younger, more modest. World War II left Nagoya and its surroundings in ruins.
*  The city was destroyed by bombs. The trees were cut down. Much of the soil had been stripped
*  to make clay. This forest was planted in the years following the war as an intentional act
*  of recovery. Since then, these trees had been struggling to grow in that white, clay-heavy soil.
*  That's why they looked the way they did, lean, hungry, twisting. They had to work harder than
*  trees in other places. This is part of why Goro was determined not to cut down a tree.
*  He didn't want to cut down a single one. When a few trees got in the way of Ghibli Park's construction,
*  he had them carefully moved. I kept walking. I scaled steep wooden stairways.
*  Very few other people were out hiking, so most of the time it felt as if we were all alone,
*  me and the trees. I considered the Japanese term forest bathing, the notion that walking through
*  trees cleanses your soul. I walked on boardwalks that stretched up toward the canopy.
*  I thought about how this was a place I never would have visited in 100 lifetimes, this unfamous,
*  small forest in a municipal park on the outskirts of an industrial city in Japan. And how this was
*  exactly Goro's plan, to lure people here with the promise of Ghibli's imaginary world, and then to
*  give them this real one. This place was real, and I was real, and those two realities were overlapping.
*  Trees, trees, trees. It was entirely up to me where to go, what to look at, when to leave.
*  I stopped to watch a spider working in some upper branches, building a large web, twisting and
*  prancing, silhouetted against the blue sky. I passed clusters of fallen acorns on the ground,
*  the forest replenishing itself. And they made me think about Totoro, and thinking about Totoro
*  made me notice more acorns. And soon I stooped to collect some. I filled my pockets. I was happy.
*  And it struck me that this was exactly what I went into Miyazaki's films for,
*  in what Miyazaki's animation almost paradoxically did for me. It helped me to find reality,
*  to really see it, to experience it as real, ordinary and strange, boring and surprising.
*  Ghibli Park, in its simplicity, honored this spirit completely. Goro's vision of a theme park
*  was more radical than the grandest roller coaster could ever be.
*  As the sun started to set, I followed a steep path to the top of a hill. There was a little
*  clearing with wooden benches, an old informational sign from the World Expo. It looked like a place
*  no one had been in 10 years. I went inside a small wooden building that turned out to be a bathroom,
*  taped up on a utility closet with thick green tape was a single sheet of paper.
*  It seemed to be some kind of sign. I examined it. It showed a blurry photo of a stout monkey
*  standing on all fours. There was some Japanese text underneath, so I ran it through my phone's
*  translation app. The sign was a warning for hikers, but in that moment it read to me like
*  a poem or a whole life philosophy. Do not make eye contact with monkeys. Do not feed the monkeys
*  or expose them to food. After a while, we will move, not stimulating please.
*  Thank you.
