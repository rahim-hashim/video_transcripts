# The Crypto President
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg)
*  Hey, it's Michael. Before we start today's show, I have a request. For an upcoming episode, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=0.0s)]
*  we want to hear from you about this very uncertain moment in the economy. Specifically, we want [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=7.32s)]
*  your questions about it. So send us those questions about President Trump's tariffs, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  the global trade war, the wobbly stock market, and what all of it means for you. No question [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=19.94s)]
*  is too big or too small. Record a voice memo with the question, include your name, age, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=26.5s)]
*  and where you're from, and email it to thedailyatnytimes.com and make sure in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=32.78s)]
*  subject line to put the word economy. Okay, here's today's show. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=40.34s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. This is The Daily. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=45.22s)]
*  President Trump was once a loud skeptic of cryptocurrency, who called it a haven for drug [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=57.5s)]
*  dealers and scammers. But over the past few months, he's emerged as the industry's biggest cheerleader. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=63.54s)]
*  A New Times investigation shows just how much the president and his family have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=68.9s)]
*  profited from that transformation. Today, my colleague Eric Lipton on what happens when [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=73.3s)]
*  the country's top crypto policymaker is himself a crypto entrepreneur. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=78.82s)]
*  It's Thursday, May 1st. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=86.5s)]
*  So Eric, you have been extremely busy covering the business interests of the Trump family since [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=91.82s)]
*  the first Trump presidency. And back then, the focus really seemed like it was on Trump's real [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=105.3s)]
*  estate deals, like running a hotel in Washington, D.C., where people might try to stay to curry [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=111.86s)]
*  favor or trading on the Trump name in various ways while Trump was in office. But more recently, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=116.66s)]
*  you have been looking at conflicts in the second term. And so I want to start by talking about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=123.06s)]
*  what you have found, but also how what you have found compares to the conflicts of the first term. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=128.1s)]
*  The first term, it's almost quaint in comparison. The scale of the conflicts and the amount of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=134.98s)]
*  money in play is so much greater and the complexity of the conflicts are greater. It's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=140.74s)]
*  no longer an appearance of a conflict of interest. It is clearly a conflict of interest. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=145.86s)]
*  It is no longer theoretical, basically. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=150.9s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the Trump family in the second term is effectively unleashed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=152.9s)]
*  They're no longer hesitant about pursuing profits without restraint. And by far, the biggest and most [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=157.78s)]
*  problematic conflict that my colleagues, David, Yaffe, Bellamy, Ben protests and I have found as [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=165.54s)]
*  we've looked at this, it relates to the president's interest in cryptocurrency. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=171.06s)]
*  So we have talked on the show before about how Trump has really sort of changed direction [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=177.7s)]
*  on crypto. Originally, he actually seemed like kind of a skeptic about the industry. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  And obviously now, not only is he a booster, but he's actually in the business himself. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=186.42s)]
*  So can you just talk a little bit, how did we go from Trump being sort of skeptical and then [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=192.02s)]
*  coming around to crypto and then to actually getting involved? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  It's a pretty radical turnaround. I mean, this is the same guy who in 2019 was tweeting that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=203.22s)]
*  he's not a fan of cryptocurrency because it's involved in drug trade and other illegal activity. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=210.58s)]
*  And then by 2024, he's at a cryptocurrency conference and calling how he's going to make [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=216.5s)]
*  the United States the crypto capital of the world and is embracing crypto. And a few things happened [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=223.14s)]
*  in between that changed his tune. And that includes millions of dollars in campaign [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=229.22s)]
*  contributions coming in from the cryptocurrency industry, which was quite frustrated with the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=235.06s)]
*  Biden administration and its very intense regulatory posture relative to crypto. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=241.38000000000002s)]
*  And also just the sense that this crypto community, both of crypto enthusiasts who are [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=247.3s)]
*  buyers of crypto and the corporate world that is backing it, that that was a constituency [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  that he could pick up because it represents a slice of America, both donors and voters, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  that felt disaffected. And it might as well go grab them and bring them onto your side. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=263.7s)]
*  And he did that quite effectively. And another thing that was happening in the background was [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=267.94s)]
*  Don Jr., his oldest son and Eric, who are the key players in the family business operations, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=272.9s)]
*  went to the dad Trump and said, you know what, this is a business that we actually want to embrace [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=279.54s)]
*  for political reasons and also for potentially profit making reasons. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=284.74s)]
*  So they came up with two ideas. One was to launch something called the meme coin, which is like a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=288.42s)]
*  collectible. And the second was to launch a whole new business that they call World Liberty [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=294.26s)]
*  Financial, which is effectively a cryptocurrency bank. And those were the two business venture [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  ideas they came up with. And they began to pursue even before the election. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=304.5s)]
*  Okay, so we're going to get into what both of these things are. Let's start with the meme coin, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  because that's the one I'm I think a little bit more familiar with. I'm thinking of the Doge coin, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=314.02s)]
*  the picture of a dog on this coin that I think was sort of launched as a joke. But can you just [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  explain to me and everybody else like what exactly is a meme coin? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=323.46s)]
*  A meme coin is effectively it's sort of like a beanie baby or a baseball card. It's something [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  that is limited in numbers, and that people want as a collectible. And they can become quite valuable [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  really quickly, they can go up in value, because there's a certain amount of them, their commodity [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=339.62s)]
*  and people want them and they're going to willing to pay a lot, then they'll suddenly surge in value. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=344.17999999999995s)]
*  But the people who issue these meme coins, they say that well, they're not an investment vehicle. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=348.17999999999995s)]
*  They're a collectible. So you're welcome to buy them if you'd like. And so it's 944 p.m. on January [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=353.14s)]
*  17th. And hundreds of people are gathering for a crypto ball in advance of Trump's inauguration. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  And on that evening, Trump posts on true social that my new official mean coin is here. And it's [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=366.82s)]
*  time to celebrate and everyone should go buy it. And it has a picture of him on this card that you [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  get if you buy the meme coin with his fist in the air and it says fight, fight, fight. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=380.18s)]
*  And so when the president elect the United States announces on true social that you should go buy [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=385.22s)]
*  my collectible, in fact, hundreds of thousands of people around the world did. And it suddenly [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=390.42s)]
*  overnight became one of the most popular and most valuable meme coins in the world. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=397.94s)]
*  Do we know exactly like how they made money from these meme coins and how much money they made [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=404.42s)]
*  from them? The Trump family controls 80 percent of the meme coins that eventually will be issued by [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=409.94s)]
*  this platform. But they haven't sold any of them yet. So that's just pay for money. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=416.74s)]
*  Yes, it's theoretical money. We could see in the marketplace that they haven't sold it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=421.78s)]
*  But they also make money every time there's a purchase and a sale and there's a transaction. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=425.62s)]
*  There's a small cut that's taken by the issuer of the meme coin. And so we were able to determine [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=430.9s)]
*  with the help of some crypto analytical companies that there was more than 100 million dollars just [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=436.66s)]
*  as of March in transaction fees that were generated as a result of these of these transactions. So it [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=442.1s)]
*  was already generating, you know, tens of millions or 100 million dollars for President Trump, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=447.46000000000004s)]
*  members of his family and their business partners that launched this meme coin. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=454.1s)]
*  But there were some real losers because what happened with the Trump meme coin is that the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=458.82000000000005s)]
*  price spiked almost instantaneously from 17 cents to seventy five dollars. And everyone looked at [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=465.22s)]
*  that and think, wow, I better get in on this and buy it because it's going to go even higher. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  And just as it hit seventy five dollars, the crash began and it went down just as quickly as it went [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=476.98s)]
*  up. And there were hundreds of thousands of people who bet their own money on this Trump meme coin, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=484.02000000000004s)]
*  who then quickly became losers and were left with large losses on this speculative bet that they had [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=489.62s)]
*  made following the advice of President-elect Trump. And is any of that illegal? It's not illegal if you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  follow the fine print, which says buyer beware, this is a collectible. This is not an investment. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=503.22s)]
*  But that said, traditionally, if there had been a launch like this, an overnight, one of the most [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  valuable meme coins in the world, what I've been told is that this likely would have resulted in a [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=516.58s)]
*  review by staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission to see whether or not there was any [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=522.74s)]
*  potential violations of federal law. And that did not occur. And in fact, what happened was [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=527.7800000000001s)]
*  soon after Trump became president and he appointed an acting head at the SEC, there was a new policy [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=534.0200000000001s)]
*  that was issued that formally announced for the first time that meme coins will not be the subject [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=540.98s)]
*  of investigations or regulatory actions to punish issuers of meme coins. So Trump personally benefits [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=546.18s)]
*  from this thing that is an illegal gray area, this meme coin. Then he becomes president and then under [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=554.7399999999999s)]
*  him, the agency that might have investigated him in an earlier administration, perhaps a more [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=560.5s)]
*  aggressive administration puts out a statement that says nothing to see here. That's right. And now, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=566.18s)]
*  more recently, as the meme coin was bottoming out in value, President Trump and his financial [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=572.34s)]
*  backers announced that they're going to have a contest that says for the top 220 holders of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=581.38s)]
*  this cryptocurrency, that they're going to get an invite to have a private special dinner at the Trump [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=588.1800000000001s)]
*  Golf Club in suburban Washington with the president of the United States. Wow. And they create a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=594.9s)]
*  leaderboard with an online game where you can bid yourself up on the rankings to see where you are. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=600.9s)]
*  The more you buy, the higher your rankings. And they say that you have to have a certain ranking [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=606.8199999999999s)]
*  between now and the middle of May in order to be eligible for this dinner. And so, again, it's like [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=612.5s)]
*  they're directly selling access to the president of the United States if you buy his meme coin, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=618.42s)]
*  that's going to bring him and his family profits. And not only that, but they say for the top [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=623.14s)]
*  people at the top of the 220, we will give you a tour of the White House. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=627.86s)]
*  But wait, can I just say, Eric, that like, I think people might be thinking, okay, well, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=632.58s)]
*  big donors get access to political candidates to then become presidents all the time. But just to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=636.1s)]
*  put a point on this, those donors are, number one, donating for a specific issue or to get a specific [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=641.54s)]
*  candidate elected. It's not like they're writing checks to somebody's personal bank account. And [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=648.34s)]
*  here, people are paying what sounds like a ton of money to get what sounds like explicit access [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=653.38s)]
*  to the president of the United States. That's right. I mean, you know, this is [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=660.26s)]
*  not a campaign contribution. This is a payment that benefits financially the president and his [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=664.42s)]
*  family. And that's what makes it so unprecedented is, yeah, we live in a democracy where campaign [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=669.4599999999999s)]
*  contributions are legal. And if you make a lot of them, you get more access. But we don't live in [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=676.02s)]
*  a country where traditionally, if you pay the elected president of the United States money [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=681.22s)]
*  personally, then you can have dinner with him and you can enrich his family personally. And so [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=685.94s)]
*  that's the distinction here is that the president and his family are personally profiting from this. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=692.4200000000001s)]
*  But as we continue to look at this and learn more about the meme coin, what we realized is that this [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=698.4200000000001s)]
*  was just a small piece of the cryptocurrency efforts that the Trump family was undertaking. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=703.86s)]
*  And in fact, the scale of the self-enrichment was even greater with their second venture that they [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=709.62s)]
*  call World Liberty Financial. Which is what? Tell us about that company. World Liberty is effectively [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=715.46s)]
*  a cryptocurrency bank. This is the Trump family saying, we're going to become the JP Morgan Chase [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=720.98s)]
*  of the cryptocurrency world, and we're going to make a lot of money doing it. So at first, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=727.3s)]
*  this new business venture is kicked off shortly before the election. It's not taken very seriously. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=731.94s)]
*  It's being promoted by three of Trump's sons, Eric Trump, Don Jr., and Baron, who's now becoming [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=736.74s)]
*  a part of the family business ventures. And then they've got other outside partners that for the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=743.0600000000001s)]
*  most part, we'd never heard of. I mean, a guy named Zach Folkman, Chase Hero, who were these [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=748.1800000000001s)]
*  serial entrepreneurs that have had a series of business failures. They sold a colon cleanser. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=754.5s)]
*  One of them was selling, you know, kind of how to pick up hot girls advice. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=760.5s)]
*  It wasn't actually called that, was it? No, it really was called that. It was a website called [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=765.9399999999999s)]
*  DateHotterGirls.com. Wow. And then Zach Witkoff, who's the son of Trump's new Middle East envoy, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=770.18s)]
*  Steve Witkoff, who's a real estate lawyer and a friend of Trump's for years. And so it's the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=778.66s)]
*  Trump sons and these other players that we've not heard of before. What exactly does World Liberty [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=783.54s)]
*  Financial do? They lay out some of these ambitions and something they call the gold paper, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=789.46s)]
*  which on the title page has this large portrait of Donald Trump with gold paint splashed across it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=795.38s)]
*  Trump's face is on every single page of this document that details their ambitions. And, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=803.38s)]
*  you know, they start off by just introducing this token that certain types of investors can buy [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=808.82s)]
*  in October of 2024. And just to be clear, Eric, that token, that's separate from the Trump meme [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=813.86s)]
*  coin we've been talking about, right? That's right. It's very different from the meme coin. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=818.98s)]
*  This is a token that gives buyers a say in the governance of this new financial institution. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=823.7s)]
*  And it can't be bought and sold very rapidly. It has all kinds of rules around it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=831.62s)]
*  But the Trump family from the start was going to own billions of these tokens more than anyone else. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=836.66s)]
*  Got it. OK, so what happens when they release this token into the market? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=842.1800000000001s)]
*  It's actually quite a flop and they way underperform their target of having $300 million in sales. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=846.02s)]
*  They only attract a fraction of that total. But Trump then wins the election. And from the night [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=852.26s)]
*  of the election, the money starts to pour in where suddenly there are people that want to try to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=858.9799999999999s)]
*  influence Trump. There are people who see him as a winner and someone that's likely going to have a [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=866.3399999999999s)]
*  successful cryptocurrency venture. And it goes from having a hard time raising money [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=870.66s)]
*  to raising $550 million in token sales. Wow. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=875.4599999999999s)]
*  So that's a startling number. And as reporters at the New York Times, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=880.5s)]
*  it opens up a bunch of questions for us. Who are these people? Why are they buying the token? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  And what types of conflicts of interest is this going to create when President Trump is back in [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=891.62s)]
*  office and appointing the regulators who are going to oversee his own business? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=896.3399999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=900.66s)]
*  So, Eric, before the break, you told us that you had some questions about who some of the investors [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=919.86s)]
*  were in World Liberty Financial and this new token that it had issued. What did you find when you [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=924.98s)]
*  started looking into that question? So one thing about cryptocurrency is that [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=929.7s)]
*  these transactions occur on something called the blockchain, which is essentially a public ledger [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=934.5s)]
*  of all transactions. And so anytime someone was buying the World Liberty token, their wallet, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=940.98s)]
*  which is a long number, was publicly available to see. So we could see 85,000 different wallets, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=947.1400000000001s)]
*  ultimately, that bought $550 million worth of this token. But all you see is a really long number [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=954.1s)]
*  and you don't know who's behind that wallet. And so as a team of reporters at the Times, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=960.98s)]
*  we were like, we need to figure out who some of these buyers are. So the first thing we did was [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=965.78s)]
*  we went to a company called Nansen, which is a cryptocurrency analytics company. And we said to [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=970.4200000000001s)]
*  the folks at Nansen, can you do an analysis of all of these 85,000 wallets? And can you tell us who [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=975.3000000000001s)]
*  some of them are? And they came back to us with a spreadsheet of a bunch of possible buyers of World [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=980.98s)]
*  Liberty Financial tokens. And they were from all over the world. They were from Gibraltar, from [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=987.22s)]
*  Israel, from Asia, Europe, and the United States, but they were more foreign than domestic. And a [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=992.4200000000001s)]
*  lot of them operating out of countries that you pick if you want to not have a lot of financial [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=998.98s)]
*  transparency, in fact. And so we decided we had to actually reach every single one of those companies [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1004.58s)]
*  and individuals to confirm that they actually were a buyer because maybe there was a mistake [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1010.18s)]
*  in the data analysis. It was a very laborious process because a lot of them did not want to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1013.9399999999999s)]
*  be found. And when you found some of these people, did they tell you why they had bought this token? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, in fact, I mean, one of the things I also did was I went to some cryptocurrency conferences, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1025.1399999999999s)]
*  including one that happened to be in Washington, D.C. And I had the list with me and I'm walking [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1029.3799999999999s)]
*  around and there's this guy right in front of me from Tenzor Capital that was on the list. And [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1033.7s)]
*  it's like, wow, that's convenient. And so I asked him, here, I've got you on my list. I was wondering, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1038.34s)]
*  why did you decide to buy the Trump token? And what he said was that he was confident that Trump [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1044.1s)]
*  was going to make a lot of money on this. And if Trump was going to make a lot of money that he [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1049.3799999999999s)]
*  wanted to make money, too. So that's one group of investors. But there's another that we found. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1053.86s)]
*  And these are people who are enthusiastic about Trump's plans for crypto, because Trump, by this [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1059.4599999999998s)]
*  point, has announced that he's going to significantly curtail the regulatory reach of the government [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1064.9s)]
*  as it comes to crypto. And these investors wanted to send a signal to President Trump [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1070.5s)]
*  that we support this effort. Then we found that there's people who bought the token, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1075.38s)]
*  who previously been investigated themselves. So these are people who've been charged with breaking [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1080.1000000000001s)]
*  federal laws that are buying the Trump token and celebrating the fact that he's going to basically [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1086.74s)]
*  restrict the powers of the federal regulators that had gone after them previously. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1091.86s)]
*  Can you give me an example of one of these people that they'd run afoul of regulators before and [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1096.58s)]
*  were sort of excited? I mean, the best example is Justin Sun, who has a company called Tron. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1101.06s)]
*  His name sounds sort of familiar. Yeah, Justin Sun became a phenomenon when he's the guy that bought [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1107.3s)]
*  at an art auction a banana that had been taped to the wall for millions of dollars and then proceeded [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1113.1399999999999s)]
*  to eat the banana as a stunt. I remember this guy. Yep. The six million dollar banana. Yes. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1119.14s)]
*  He likes being in the limelight. In 2023, he was accused of violating United States securities law, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1124.5s)]
*  and he was in the midst of a very intense battle to avoid being sanctioned by the United States [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1131.94s)]
*  government. Then Trump is reelected to a second term. And that's when Justin Sun decides to commit [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1137.7s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars to World Liberty Financial. He's purchased $75 million of the token. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1143.94s)]
*  And ultimately, after Trump is elected and appoints new leadership at the Securities [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1149.94s)]
*  and Exchange Commission, the United States government and Justin Sun's lawyers agree to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1155.54s)]
*  put the case on hold. It hasn't yet been dropped, but essentially the investigation has been frozen. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1161.46s)]
*  Sounds like Justin Sun effectively bought himself leniency from the SEC. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1168.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the sequence of events, that's how it unfolds. Justin Sun is accused of [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1173.94s)]
*  wrongdoing. Justin Sun puts up tens of millions of dollars into a Trump family business venture, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1179.6200000000001s)]
*  and then the investigation stops. Now, World Liberty Financial says that there have been no [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1184.5s)]
*  quid pro quos, no deals made here that if you buy in, we'll get you actions from the federal [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1189.22s)]
*  government. But sequentially, that's what happened. So this company is creating new [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1194.9s)]
*  appearances of conflicts of interest. But I'm trying to understand what does World Liberty [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1200.02s)]
*  Financial actually do with the money that they raised from the tokens that you're describing? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1204.5800000000002s)]
*  One of the first things that World Liberty Financial does is with this $550 million that [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1209.5400000000002s)]
*  have come into their coffers through people buying their token is they take some of that money and [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1214.5s)]
*  they start buying other cryptocurrencies, tens of millions of dollars. They buy some Bitcoin, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1219.38s)]
*  they buy another cryptocurrency called Ether. They're creating their own mini reserve of [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1224.34s)]
*  foreign currency reserves. Like JP Morgan buying up a lot of euros. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1230.4199999999998s)]
*  That's right. But here's the problem. Shortly after they begin to build this [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1234.4199999999998s)]
*  inventory of all these other cryptocurrencies, President Trump announces that he wants to create [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1238.82s)]
*  a federal crypto reserve and that one of the cryptocurrencies that it's going to include is [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1244.02s)]
*  Ether. And the family company has already bought tens of millions of dollars of Ether. And the [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1249.3s)]
*  moment that President Trump announces that Ether is going to be in that reserve, suddenly the price [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1254.58s)]
*  of Ether surges. And effectively, he's writing himself a check because he has a personal [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1259.86s)]
*  financial interest in it. Right. Basically, the president sent a message about his administration's [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1266.18s)]
*  policies, in this case, Ether, that led pretty directly to his family's company making a bunch [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1271.22s)]
*  of money, at least on paper. That's right. And the Trump family has said that it did not sell [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1277.86s)]
*  any of its Ether, but it has moved some of it to a different platform where we can't see whether or [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1283.3s)]
*  not it's buying and selling. So we don't really know for sure. And this is just the beginning of [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1289.62s)]
*  the conflicts of interest that have emerged as a result of the continuing operations of World [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1294.74s)]
*  Liberty Financial. Now that President Trump is in office, there's something else that's called [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1299.62s)]
*  a stablecoin that they are just now issuing that's created a whole new field of conflicts. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1304.5s)]
*  Oh, good. Another coin to understand. What is a stablecoin? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1310.8200000000002s)]
*  Yes, I'm sorry. A stablecoin is a type of a crypto token that does not fluctuate in value. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1314.1000000000001s)]
*  So what they want people to do is to come to them with any kind of a crypto and you deposit it at [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1321.78s)]
*  World Liberty Financial, bring your Bitcoin, and you can transfer that Bitcoin into a certain [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1328.1000000000001s)]
*  number of stablecoins that will have a dollar value every day, no matter what is happening in [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1334.02s)]
*  the cryptocurrency markets. A dollar value that is always the same. So if I have 50 stablecoins [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1338.58s)]
*  today, they will be worth $50 today, tomorrow, presumably six months from now. That's what the [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1343.3799999999999s)]
*  promise is, yes. I mean, it sounds like cash. That's what this sounds like. Yeah, it's an [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1348.82s)]
*  alternative form of cash, which is sort of like you might wonder, well, why are they doing this [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1353.3s)]
*  if we already have cash? Right. But this is a way that the cryptocurrency industry says we're going [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1357.62s)]
*  to create a less volatile token that you can use to transact with because if all these kinds of [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1361.86s)]
*  cryptos are constantly changing in price, you can't really use it to buy and sell things. So this is [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1368.74s)]
*  the crypto industry's answer as to how they can create a relatively stable currency. It's called [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1373.3799999999999s)]
*  the stablecoin and World Liberty Financial is now in the stablecoin industry. Okay, so I understand [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1379.3799999999999s)]
*  what a stablecoin is based on that explanation, but why does World Liberty Financial want to be [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1384.26s)]
*  in the stablecoin business? It turns out that stablecoins are one of the most profitable chunks [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1388.74s)]
*  of the whole world of cryptocurrency because they could take that digital money that you've [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1394.82s)]
*  brought them and they can earn a really big return on it and they could potentially make [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1401.54s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars a year by effectively earning money off of your money. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1406.9s)]
*  And so now World Liberty Financial as of this week is issuing stablecoins and selling them [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1413.46s)]
*  and it's actually already asserts that it has a billion dollars worth of stablecoin deposits. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1419.94s)]
*  And so it's suddenly overnight become one of the largest stablecoin issuers in the world. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1425.14s)]
*  And does any of that intersect with any policymaking that Trump is working on right now? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1430.0200000000002s)]
*  Yes, in fact, this is in fact one of the most startling conflicts of interest that we have seen [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1435.46s)]
*  so far. Congress is considering legislation that would regulate stablecoins and Trump is trying to [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1440.02s)]
*  press Congress to enact the legislation that would be beneficial to World Liberty Financial. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1446.26s)]
*  And just explain quickly, Eric, why would passing legislation help this part of the industry? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1452.02s)]
*  That legislation will be a federal endorsement of stablecoins. It'll basically legitimize it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1457.94s)]
*  It will be a federal recognition and endorsement of the stablecoin industry. And suddenly what [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1463.3799999999999s)]
*  you're going to see is that stablecoins are going to become part of the whole financial marketplace [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1468.9s)]
*  and they're going to start to become even rivals to banks. It's going to significantly increase [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1473.22s)]
*  the scale of this industry and the Trump family is positioned to profit enormously from that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1478.02s)]
*  And the president is prepared to sign that legislation that will then bring himself [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1482.98s)]
*  and his family enormous profits. Okay, so just to recap, because there's a lot here to get your [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1488.1000000000001s)]
*  arms around, we have a president who is using his office to boost coins that his family owns. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1494.34s)]
*  His administration is halting lawsuits against people who have invested in his crypto venture. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1500.34s)]
*  He's announced policies that have raised the prices of crypto that his company owns. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1505.9399999999998s)]
*  And the president is pushing for legislation that would seem to benefit his company. Do I have all [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1510.4199999999998s)]
*  that right? That's right. What did the Trumps say about these concerns about their conflicts of [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1516.98s)]
*  interest? The White House says to us that President Trump has no conflicts of interest [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1521.94s)]
*  because he turned over his financial assets to his sons and that his sons are running the business. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1526.98s)]
*  That's not entirely true. What President Trump did in 2017 when he was first elected was that he [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1534.26s)]
*  transferred all of his assets to the control of his sons. But President Trump himself is still [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1541.3s)]
*  the financial beneficiary. So he still has a direct financial interest in all this, including [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1548.18s)]
*  in World Liberty Financial and the meme coin. But President Trump says there is no conflict [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1553.14s)]
*  of interest because he no longer runs the companies. Eric, I'm just imagining somebody who [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1557.78s)]
*  could be listening to the show today and thinking, okay, I don't like that he's using his position [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1564.02s)]
*  to make money in the ways that you've explained. But I'm not a crypto investor. I don't care about [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1569.54s)]
*  crypto. This doesn't affect me. So why should I care about this side of the president's business? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1574.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. You know, most people aren't invested in crypto. But really, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1579.62s)]
*  there's a lot of reasons here that this is a cause of concern. I mean, first of all, we're just used [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1584.42s)]
*  to having a nation where the commander in chief is pursuing the interests of the public and does [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1589.54s)]
*  not have personal financial interests that are potentially affecting the choices that he's making [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1595.94s)]
*  and that may be, you know, influencing federal policy in ways that are more self-interested than [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1600.98s)]
*  in the public's interest. Beyond that, while crypto is still a pretty isolated part of the US [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1606.58s)]
*  and global economy, the goal of World Liberty is to merge the crypto sector and the traditional [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1614.74s)]
*  banking sector. And the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have both expressed concern about the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1621.38s)]
*  volatility of cryptocurrency and how if there were to suddenly be a huge downturn in crypto, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1627.62s)]
*  if these two sectors are intertwined, it could cause a systemic risk to the US economy and even [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1634.1799999999998s)]
*  the global economy. That's a concern that we'll see how that plays out in the next several years. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1640.34s)]
*  Well, Eric, thank you so much. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1645.3s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1652.5s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1663.7s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, the US and Ukraine announced a deal [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1664.5s)]
*  that would give the US proceeds from the Ukraine's rare earth minerals in exchange for a security [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1676.34s)]
*  commitment from the United States. The announcement follows months of tense negotiations and comes as [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1680.98s)]
*  the United States is trying to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. And the US economy has [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1686.66s)]
*  stopped growing and has actually shrunk, according to GDP data released this week. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1694.02s)]
*  Other data suggests that the economy is still growing, albeit slowly. But the new numbers, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1698.98s)]
*  economists say, reflect the impact of President Trump's tariff policies, which have roiled markets [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1703.78s)]
*  and created uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The president acknowledged the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1708.74s)]
*  economic turmoil in a social media post, but said tariffs are not to blame and that they would help [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1713.06s)]
*  the economy in the long run. Be patient, he wrote, with three exclamation points. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1718.18s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Will Reid, Claire Tennis-Getter, and Nina Feldman. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjB4DKkgRHg&t=1727.78s)]
