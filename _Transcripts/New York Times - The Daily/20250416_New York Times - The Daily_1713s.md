Video Description: For years, President Trump has mocked the Obama administration for the nuclear agreement that it reached with Iran — a plan he disliked so much that he revoked it.


Now, as he embarks on talks with Iran to reach a nuclear agreement of his own, the question is whether his administration can achieve a better deal.


David E. Sanger, who covers the White House and national security, takes us inside the negotiations.


Guest: David E. Sanger (https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-e-sanger) , the White House and National Security Correspondent for The New York Times.


Background reading: 

  •  President Trump wants a nuclear deal with Iran, but it must be better than President Barack Obama’s (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html) .
  •  Mr. Trump gives conflicting signals and mixed messages (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-negotations.html)  on Iran nuclear talks.

# Trump Trashed the Iran Nuclear Deal. Will His Be Any Better?
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  For years, President Trump has mocked the Obama administration for the nuclear deal [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=11.88s)]
*  that it reached with Iran. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=17.56s)]
*  This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=19.84s)]
*  A plan he disliked so much that he revoked it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=25.36s)]
*  Now, as Trump embarks on talks with Iran to reach a nuclear deal of his own, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=29.92s)]
*  We had a meeting with them on Saturday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=36.2s)]
*  We have another meeting scheduled next Saturday. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  the question is whether he can achieve anything that's actually better. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Got a problem with Iran? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=47.16s)]
*  But I'll solve that problem. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=49.08s)]
*  That's almost an easy one. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=50.84s)]
*  Today, my colleague, David Sanger, takes us inside the negotiations. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=52.84s)]
*  It's Wednesday, April 16th. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=65.16s)]
*  David, always a pleasure. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=74.68s)]
*  Great to be back with you, Michael. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=77.64s)]
*  Appreciate you making time for us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=79.72s)]
*  I think for a lot of people, the concept of President Trump suddenly wanting to negotiate [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=81.16s)]
*  a nuclear deal with Iran is genuinely surprising because it was just a few years ago during [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  his first term as president that he tore up the last nuclear deal that the US and Iran [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  had reached very painstakingly and since then has made a point of portraying Iran as basically [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=98.44s)]
*  evil. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=104.84s)]
*  And yet here we are. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=106.4s)]
*  There are actual talks happening between Iran and the United States right now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=107.52s)]
*  You know, Michael, it's nothing short of mind blowing that this is coming out of Donald [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=113.88s)]
*  Trump and his team, especially when you consider the fact that in 2024 during the campaign, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=118.36s)]
*  if you believe the Biden administration's Justice Department, the Iranians had actually [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=126.52s)]
*  hired some contract killers to try to assassinate Trump. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=131.44s)]
*  To say that there is no love between these two sides is a historic understatement. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=136.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=140.96s)]
*  So what's happening now is in some ways completely unexpected because of course during the first [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=142.0s)]
*  term, Trump not only tore up the old agreement, but it was pretty clear from the Iran hawks [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=149.56s)]
*  he surrounded himself with like Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, that what they really [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=157.24s)]
*  wanted to do was crush the Iranian regime, force it into huge changes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=163.04s)]
*  Yet now the strategic circumstances are quite different and Trump's approach is different. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, give us the context we need to understand both why Trump tore up the original nuclear [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=176.88s)]
*  deal and why he would now want to essentially redo it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=184.1s)]
*  So no country has put more effort into building a nuclear weapon for a longer period of time [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=190.24s)]
*  than the Iranians have. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=199.68s)]
*  When you think about it, it's taken them well more than two decades, far longer than it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=201.58s)]
*  took the Israelis, the Indians, the Pakistanis to go build a bomb. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=207.28s)]
*  And that in part has been because they've been of two minds about it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=214.68s)]
*  On the one hand, they want a weapon. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=219.34s)]
*  Israel has nuclear weapons. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=221.98000000000002s)]
*  And so they felt that they should have them. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=223.78s)]
*  But also because they believed that as one of the Middle East's biggest, oldest powers, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=226.4s)]
*  they should be a senior member of the nuclear club. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=235.78s)]
*  But at the same time, they've been nervous about it because they know that as soon as [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=240.3s)]
*  they get too close to a weapon, the chances that the Israelis attack, maybe with American [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=244.34s)]
*  support, is very high. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=250.22s)]
*  So in 2003, for example, after the United States had invaded Afghanistan and then Iraq, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  the Iranians deeply feared they may be next. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=261.06s)]
*  And their political leadership sent out a message to the scientists running the nuclear [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=264.26s)]
*  weapons program that says, hey, maybe this isn't such a great idea. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=269.96s)]
*  Let's take a pause on this whole thing. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=274.26s)]
*  And so they continued to produce nuclear fuel, uranium. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=277.26s)]
*  But they did so relatively slowly. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=283.7s)]
*  And in 2013, President Obama started a secret series of talks. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=287.98s)]
*  And that turned into a negotiation that two years later turned out to be a way to cap [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  Right, just kind of stall it out, freeze it in place. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=303.06s)]
*  Freeze it in place and ship 97% of the fuel that they had already produced out to Russia. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=306.32000000000005s)]
*  And this was an agreement that had some flaws in it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=313.70000000000005s)]
*  Over time, the Iranians under the agreement were allowed to begin to figure out how to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=317.82000000000005s)]
*  make uranium more efficiently. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=324.3s)]
*  And basically, by 2030, they would have no restraints at all. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=326.94000000000005s)]
*  But Obama thought this was actually a pretty good bet. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=331.78s)]
*  After all, Ayatollah Khamenei was old. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  He was believed to be suffering from cancer. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=338.9s)]
*  And this would buy some time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=342.78s)]
*  And in return, years of sanctions approved by the United Nations and enforced by the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  US and Europe would get lifted. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=350.94s)]
*  So for them, there was a lot of inducement to reach the deal. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=353.73999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=357.94s)]
*  This, of course, is the deal that Donald Trump comes along as president, looks at and says, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=358.94s)]
*  this is terrible. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  Actually, he did it as candidate. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  It was one of his earliest positions in 2016 that this deal was a giveaway. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=368.1s)]
*  It was negotiated by idiots and never should have been agreed to. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=376.78s)]
*  In fact, at one point, Maggie Haberman and I were interviewing him in 2016 in, I think, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=382.72s)]
*  one of his first foreign policy interviews. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=388.52000000000004s)]
*  And he said, you know, I would have gotten up from the table and walked away on parts [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=391.88s)]
*  of that agreement. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=397.48s)]
*  And so I remember pulling out a copy of the agreement. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=399.32s)]
*  And the Obama agreement was not short. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=403.36s)]
*  It was like 150 detailed pages. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  And I said, what part of this would you have walked away from? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=408.36s)]
*  Well, of course, he fumbled around for a bit. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=412.32s)]
*  But eventually, when I said, well, is it long enough? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=415.46s)]
*  He said, no, no, no, it doesn't last long enough. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=418.26s)]
*  And you know, it doesn't actually dismantle anything. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=420.46s)]
*  So those were his complaints. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=424.0s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is, when he came in as president, his own aide said to him, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=426.53999999999996s)]
*  hey, this thing is working. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  They're not producing enough fuel to make a single weapon. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=433.26s)]
*  So we understand that you hate it, but maybe you shouldn't tear it up. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=437.0s)]
*  But of course, he finds it objectionable enough that he does tear it up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=441.29999999999995s)]
*  So with all that history in mind, knowing that the original deal was imperfect but was [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=445.22s)]
*  fundamentally working, and how much contempt there is between both sides of this, why suddenly [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=452.66s)]
*  in April of 2025, all these years later, does Trump want to do it all over again? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=459.66s)]
*  Well, you know, Michael, since he left office in January of 2021, a lot has changed for [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=465.62s)]
*  the United States, for Iran, for the state of its nuclear program, even for the Israelis, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  who of course have long been trying to slow this down and threatening to destroy Iran's [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=481.66s)]
*  facilities. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=487.18s)]
*  Well, let's start with the U.S. and what basically has changed in Trump's view of this situation. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=488.18s)]
*  Well, the main thing that's changed in Donald Trump's perception of it is that he's been [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=494.34000000000003s)]
*  given a lot of intelligence reports that suggest that Iran is wildly closer to a weapon than [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=501.02000000000004s)]
*  it was when he left office. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=508.34000000000003s)]
*  Huh, how much closer? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=510.5s)]
*  Way closer. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=512.58s)]
*  So to make a nuclear weapon, you need, most importantly, the fuel for it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=517.1800000000001s)]
*  You need uranium or plutonium. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=524.1s)]
*  The Iranians have been working on enriching uranium at various sites, some of them deep [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=527.26s)]
*  underground. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=533.1800000000001s)]
*  And usually you make uranium at a low enrichment level that enables you to produce nuclear [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=535.34s)]
*  power in a power plant. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=543.5s)]
*  But what the Iranians have done is enrich to just short of bomb grade. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=546.7s)]
*  They've gone up to what the scientists call 60% enrichment. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=552.7s)]
*  And that's a very short leap, just days or weeks, to the 90% you need to make a bomb. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=557.74s)]
*  So in other words, they can go into the kitchen, and here I'm being a little facetious, and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=565.1s)]
*  pretty quickly whip up the amount of enriched uranium to get a nuclear bomb. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=569.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=576.94s)]
*  Now, the fuel alone does not make a weapon. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=577.94s)]
*  You then have to fabricate it, turn it into a metal, fit it into a warhead, design a triggering [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=581.8s)]
*  system and so forth. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=589.56s)]
*  And one of the concerns that Trump got in the intelligence that the Biden administration [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=592.12s)]
*  left for him was that the Iranians were racing ahead to a faster, cruder way to build a weapon. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  Maybe they could make one in just months. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=608.64s)]
*  And you know, I think Trump recognized if they did that, it's not just the Middle East [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=616.16s)]
*  that changes. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=620.68s)]
*  The world changes, right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=622.06s)]
*  Because all of a sudden, this regime, which still says it is looking for death to America [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=623.76s)]
*  and an end to the Zionists and Israel. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=630.18s)]
*  And that's why a series of American presidents, back to Bill Clinton and George Bush, have [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=633.04s)]
*  said one can never let Iran have a bomb. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=639.12s)]
*  Is it fair to say that Iran only got this far because Trump tore up the last nuclear [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=643.26s)]
*  deal? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump wouldn't say that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=651.0799999999999s)]
*  He'd blame it on Joe Biden. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=653.12s)]
*  But I would certainly say, having followed this thing for a couple of decades, that Trump's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=654.74s)]
*  decision to walk out of the agreement in 2018 eventually gave the Iranians the opening to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=661.02s)]
*  go race ahead. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=670.94s)]
*  They said, look, if you're not going to abide by the rules in this agreement, we certainly [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=672.86s)]
*  aren't. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=677.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=678.14s)]
*  So we're in a situation now where they're far closer to a weapon than they were when [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=679.14s)]
*  the U.S. negotiated this agreement in 2015. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=684.26s)]
*  So that explains why the U.S. perspective and level of anxiety about this has changed. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=688.94s)]
*  What incentive, David, would Iran have to negotiate a new deal after, as you just said, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=694.5400000000001s)]
*  making all this progress towards its long-held goal of having a nuclear bomb? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=699.82s)]
*  Well, the simplest answer to that, Michael, is the Iranians suddenly have never been more [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=705.7800000000001s)]
*  exposed. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=713.2600000000001s)]
*  After the October 7th, 2023 terror attack on Israel, the Israelis systematically destroyed [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=715.16s)]
*  Hamas and then last fall Hezbollah, the two terror groups that were funded and basically [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=724.12s)]
*  proxies of the Iranians. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=732.48s)]
*  Right, kind of the shield that Iran had in the entire neighborhood around it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=740.48s)]
*  And then the Assad government in Syria fell. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=741.64s)]
*  And Assad was the closest single ally that the Iranians had. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=745.64s)]
*  And then one more thing changed, and this was probably the biggest of all. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=752.12s)]
*  You'll remember that last year there were these series of direct missile exchanges between [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=757.0s)]
*  Iran and Israel. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=762.72s)]
*  That had never happened before. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=763.72s)]
*  But two things happened in this. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=766.4s)]
*  The first is the Iranian missiles, which we thought were pretty fierce and hard to defend [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=768.54s)]
*  against, did not pierce the anti-missile defenses that Israel and the United States had carefully [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=775.14s)]
*  assembled around the region. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=782.66s)]
*  Almost nothing got through. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=784.98s)]
*  And then in late October of last year, the Israelis retaliated. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=787.18s)]
*  They very carefully did not attack the Iranian nuclear facilities, but instead they took [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=793.98s)]
*  out all of the Iranian air defenses that were around the nuclear facilities and around Tehran. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=800.96s)]
*  Got it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=809.26s)]
*  So here were the Iranians without their proxies, without their missile defenses, totally exposed. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=810.36s)]
*  So if you're Iran, you're thinking to yourself, we, because Trump tore up the last nuclear [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=818.56s)]
*  deal, are getting really close to a nuclear bomb, which might trigger Israel or, I guess [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=823.78s)]
*  the United States, to come after our nuclear facilities, attack them, try to destroy them. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  And because of what you just said, they've never been less capable of defending against [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=837.5999999999999s)]
*  that attack or capable of mounting retaliation. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=841.8s)]
*  Because like you just said, if they go attack Israel, we kind of know it will mostly be [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=845.4000000000001s)]
*  a dud. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=849.8000000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=851.08s)]
*  So when you add all of this together, President Trump decided, let's give this one try at [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=852.82s)]
*  a non-Obama, very Trumpian agreement. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=861.72s)]
*  And he sat in the Oval Office editing a letter to Ayatollah Khamenei that basically said, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=866.5s)]
*  I'm going to send my representatives. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=874.28s)]
*  You guys have just a couple of months to do this. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=877.72s)]
*  I'm not going to let it drag on. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=880.4s)]
*  But let's try one thing before, as the president said, I am forced to do the obvious. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=883.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=890.28s)]
*  Obvious meaning a military attack. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=891.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=892.92s)]
*  And this work, Steve Witkoff, Trump's old friend and favorite negotiator, goes from talking [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=894.72s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin in Moscow to flying to Oman, meeting the Iranian foreign minister. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=901.56s)]
*  And this Saturday, they are going to begin the first serious discussions on a new Iran [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=908.3599999999999s)]
*  deal. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=914.5999999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=919.5999999999999s)]
*  So, David, now that these negotiations are actually happening, what exactly do both sides [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=920.64s)]
*  want out of them? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  And what would represent a good deal to both of them, the US and to Iran? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=936.46s)]
*  And how far apart are those two visions? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=942.0400000000001s)]
*  So of course, there's no unanimity inside any of these groups, inside Iran and inside [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=944.88s)]
*  the United States. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=951.32s)]
*  But given that, what the Iranians want is something as close to the 2015 agreement with [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=952.32s)]
*  Obama as they can get, while recognizing that Donald Trump isn't going to take anything [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=957.6600000000001s)]
*  that looks exactly like something Barack Obama negotiated. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=964.24s)]
*  They would like to hold on to their facilities the way they did in the Obama era. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=969.38s)]
*  They are willing to back off on their big enrichment of near bomb grade fuel. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=974.74s)]
*  But they want to retain their capability. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=983.54s)]
*  Because frankly, as they have said, they don't trust the United States and they don't trust [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=986.72s)]
*  Donald Trump because he walked away from the last agreement the US signed. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=991.98s)]
*  So they want to give some space between them and Obama, but without giving up the capability [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=998.42s)]
*  of racing forward if everything turns south. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1007.42s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to guess that this is not what President Trump wants. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1009.9399999999999s)]
*  Well we don't know exactly yet what President Trump wants. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1013.86s)]
*  There is a lot of strategic incoherence inside the Trump administration. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1018.14s)]
*  What have they said so far? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1022.5799999999999s)]
*  Well they started off by saying what they want is full dismantlement of the Iranian [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1025.1s)]
*  nuclear infrastructure. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1032.4199999999998s)]
*  Nothing less than full dismantlement. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1034.62s)]
*  What does that mean though? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1036.1799999999998s)]
*  So what the United States would like to do is blow up the facilities, take all the fuel [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1037.3s)]
*  that they've got in the country and ship it out again and basically leave the Iranians [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1043.4199999999998s)]
*  with nothing that they could rebuild quickly. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1050.78s)]
*  So what the US wants is not just a setback to Iran's nuclear program, but its destruction. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1055.2s)]
*  Is that plausible? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1060.22s)]
*  It would seem that Iran would have very little reason to agree to that. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1061.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1066.76s)]
*  They're not interested in giving up everything. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1067.76s)]
*  And they made it clear as the negotiation started, if you're asking for us to give up [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1069.48s)]
*  the whole program, then might as well stop this negotiation now. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1075.26s)]
*  Okay, well given how far apart the two sides are, Iran wants basically the original 2015 [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1079.98s)]
*  deal that freezes its nuclear program. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1087.02s)]
*  The US says we want a public demolition of your entire infrastructure. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1088.9399999999998s)]
*  What do we know so far about the actual negotiations and how on earth they might somehow meet in [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1094.0s)]
*  the middle? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1100.46s)]
*  So Michael, it's been really fascinating because Steve Witkoff, who really had no experience [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1101.6599999999999s)]
*  in dealing with nuclear issues before, announced on Fox News the other day that actually he's [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1109.3s)]
*  just interested in capping the program and making sure that we could verify that the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1118.06s)]
*  Iranians were not producing uranium at 60% purity, but instead at a much lower number, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1124.02s)]
*  what you'd use for power plants. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1131.3799999999999s)]
*  David, that sounds a lot, a lot like the deal Obama reached. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1132.94s)]
*  If it sounds a lot like the old Obama agreement, it's because it's a lot like the old Obama [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1138.46s)]
*  agreement. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1145.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1146.14s)]
*  But you know, the demands keep changing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1147.14s)]
*  So on Tuesday, Witkoff backed off of his comments about merely capping the nuclear program, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1148.98s)]
*  and he repeated the call for eliminating the entire nuclear program. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1156.18s)]
*  So we don't know yet what the exact terms will be. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1160.1000000000001s)]
*  But I'm sure that there will be features that let Trump claim he got a lot more than Obama [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1164.22s)]
*  did, that his deal is really different. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1170.38s)]
*  But in reality, he may be renegotiating the exact deal he tore up seven, correct my math, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1174.58s)]
*  years ago and that allowed Iran to leap forward as much as it has toward a bomb. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1183.38s)]
*  That's certainly right. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1189.54s)]
*  So he's going to have to prove that it's longer and stronger. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1190.74s)]
*  Remember the original deal was going to expire in 2030. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1194.42s)]
*  Well, that seemed a long way away when they were doing this in 2015, but it's only five [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1197.82s)]
*  years from now. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1203.1s)]
*  It's not very long. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1204.1s)]
*  So it would certainly have to have a much longer timeline. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1205.1s)]
*  And then there's something harder because, I mean, you can measure how much nuclear fuel [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1208.82s)]
*  they have, but Witkoff also said that they needed to verify that they weren't working [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1212.66s)]
*  on what he called nuclear triggers, the technology to make a weapon. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1219.5s)]
*  And that's really hard to go do because you can hide that work in a million different [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1224.54s)]
*  places and you can do a lot of it virtually on computers. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1229.74s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, you can buy nuclear triggers from a willing seller. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1234.34s)]
*  Who are among the Iranians' best new friends in recent times? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1240.62s)]
*  The North Koreans. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1244.34s)]
*  And they've mastered this technology. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1245.54s)]
*  David, assuming that Trump can accept a deal that ultimately looks a lot like the deal [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1247.78s)]
*  he has railed against for years and years and years, let's talk about Iran for just [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1252.3s)]
*  another moment. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1257.74s)]
*  What would Iran get out of a deal that freezes all of its nuclear program, not destroy it, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1258.74s)]
*  but just freezes it that would make it worse its while? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1264.9399999999998s)]
*  What they would get, Michael, is relief from these crushing economic sanctions that have [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1269.1399999999999s)]
*  limited the amount of oil that Iran can ship around the world, that has made it impossible [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1274.82s)]
*  to go invest in Iran, that has left their air fleet without spare parts, that has made [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1281.26s)]
*  it difficult to get even medical help, and that has stopped their connections to the [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1290.26s)]
*  world's banking system. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1295.78s)]
*  So they would want all of these kind of sanctions, which Trump reimposed in 2018 when he pulled [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1297.66s)]
*  out of the deal, they would want all of those lifted. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1304.58s)]
*  So, David, at this point, recognizing that these talks are in very early stages, what [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1308.94s)]
*  are the chances in your mind that a deal gets reached? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1312.82s)]
*  I think the chance is pretty good. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1317.02s)]
*  But the history of Iranian nuclear negotiations is that people walk right up to sealing a [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1320.62s)]
*  deal, and then in the end, it's the decision of one man, Ayatollah Khamenei, who previously [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1328.74s)]
*  forbid even direct discussions with the United States, but now is issuing cautious sounding [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1336.74s)]
*  statements saying, well, let's basically play this out and see what they're willing to offer. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1343.98s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1349.3s)]
*  But if there is no deal, based on everything you've said here, what would happen is that [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1350.3s)]
*  the United States and Israel would eventually need to undertake some sort of military operation [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1355.06s)]
*  to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1360.3s)]
*  And Iran is pretty powerless to stop it or to meaningfully retaliate against it. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1364.18s)]
*  And so is that scenario all that problematic for the U.S. and Israel? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1369.46s)]
*  Well, you know, Donald Trump is a big fan of coercive diplomacy. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1376.82s)]
*  So what's he done in recent weeks as they have gotten ready to have this discussion? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1383.18s)]
*  He's taken the American fleet of B-2 bombers and he's put them on an American base that [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1388.3400000000001s)]
*  is within reach of Iran. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1395.22s)]
*  And the Iranians know just what that plane means because it's the only plane capable [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1398.94s)]
*  lifting this enormous bunker busting bomb the U.S. developed just for Iranian and North [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1406.14s)]
*  Korean facilities. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1414.46s)]
*  And the message to the Iranians is if you don't strike this deal, this thing's going [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1416.66s)]
*  right through the deep underground facilities you have built. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1421.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1427.0600000000002s)]
*  Iran is back into a corner. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1428.0600000000002s)]
*  One way or another, it's going to have to give up its nuclear program at the stage it's [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1429.64s)]
*  in right now. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1434.26s)]
*  That is the message the U.S. is sending. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1435.74s)]
*  But I'm sure that there are some factions within Iran that says this is a bluff. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1439.1s)]
*  Donald Trump doesn't want to get sucked into another war in the Middle East. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1447.3s)]
*  That's a very big bet. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1452.06s)]
*  You're suggesting that Iran might take to kind of play chicken with Donald Trump and [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1453.06s)]
*  those B-2 bombers and the very real possibility that we might attack it. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1457.58s)]
*  Well, you know, Michael, for the Iranians, this is really a you bet your country moment. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1462.82s)]
*  If they say no deal, we can't put up with the American demands, then they still have [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1469.1399999999999s)]
*  the sanctions on them. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1476.3799999999999s)]
*  They are vulnerable to the Israelis going to President Trump and saying, see, we told [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1478.72s)]
*  you they weren't serious. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1486.98s)]
*  So the only solution here is a military one. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1488.86s)]
*  On the other hand, if they do cap the program, then of course, their entire position in the [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1492.22s)]
*  region as a power to be reckoned with is really harmed. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1499.7s)]
*  So the Iranians are up for a really tough choice here. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1508.94s)]
*  And their big question is, can they find a face saving way to avoid military conflict? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1514.82s)]
*  Can they manage an unpredictable President Trump and a diminished set of defenses? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1524.54s)]
*  Well, David, thank you very much. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1537.1399999999999s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1539.62s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1541.1399999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1544.82s)]
*  Here's what else you need to another day. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1565.1399999999999s)]
*  On Tuesday, President Trump escalated his standoff with Harvard University by threatening [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1568.9399999999998s)]
*  to remove its tax exempt status after the school refused to comply with his demands [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1574.38s)]
*  for policy changes. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1580.5s)]
*  Such a decision over time could cost Harvard billions of dollars. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1582.5400000000002s)]
*  It's unclear exactly how Trump could carry out the threat. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1587.7800000000002s)]
*  Under federal law, a president is prohibited from directly ordering the IRS to conduct [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1592.1000000000001s)]
*  the kind of investigation that might result in Harvard losing its tax exempt status. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1597.9s)]
*  And... [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1604.42s)]
*  Fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1605.6200000000001s)]
*  It's kind of breathtaking if it happened that soon. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1615.98s)]
*  In his first speech since leaving office, former President Joe Biden criticized the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1618.74s)]
*  Trump White House for its drastic cuts to the government bureaucracy, focusing in particular [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1624.02s)]
*  on how many workers it has forced out of the Social Security Administration. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1630.18s)]
*  That, Biden said, now threatens to break the program's sacred promise to the tens of millions [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1635.86s)]
*  of Americans who rely on Social Security. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1642.66s)]
*  In the 90 years since Franklin Roosevelt created the Social Security system, people have always [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1645.34s)]
*  gotten their Social Security checks. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1650.98s)]
*  They've gotten them during wartime, during recessions, during a pandemic. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1653.34s)]
*  No matter what, they got them. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1659.22s)]
*  But now, for the first time ever, that might change. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1661.74s)]
*  It would be a calamity for millions of families, millions of people. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1667.34s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Rachelle Banja and Mary Wilson. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEF-Ulny-B0&t=1677.54s)]
