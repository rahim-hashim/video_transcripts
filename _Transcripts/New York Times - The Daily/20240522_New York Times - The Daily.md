# Bidenâ€™s Open War On Hidden Fees
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqUSKdS5rDk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, President Biden has declared war on hidden fees that cost American consumers tens
*  of billions of dollars a year.
*  But as my colleague Jim Tankersley explains, it's doubling as a war against something
*  else that Biden is finding much harder to defeat.
*  It's Wednesday, May 22nd.
*  Jim, over the past few weeks, the Biden administration has decided to take on airline fees about
*  as dreaded an enemy as you can imagine.
*  And I want you to just describe what the president has done.
*  Oh, Michael, I don't know if you do a lot of flying.
*  But when you do fly on an airline, it turns out there are a lot of additional charges
*  beyond just the price of the ticket.
*  Now, this depends on on which airline you fly.
*  But a lot of airlines now, they ask you to select a seat and they might charge you for
*  your selection or for any selection.
*  Right.
*  Do they ever they charge you to have the person you travel with sit next to you and the baby
*  you're traveling with sit next to that person?
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  If you want to check a bag on some airlines, that's a fee.
*  If you want to carry on on some other airlines or with certain tickets, that's a fee.
*  And so what we have are several airlines that have adopted sort of a business model where
*  you charge low ticket prices upfront, but then you add fees throughout the process.
*  And by the end, your ticket could double.
*  Right.
*  And just to name a couple of names, why not Spirit Frontier?
*  That's how they operate.
*  Sure.
*  And then even the bigger guys like American and United have started charging some more
*  of these fees, too.
*  So fees are sort of on the rise across the airline industry.
*  OK.
*  Joe Biden.
*  Right.
*  So the Biden administration, led by the transportation department, swoops in, finalizes some rules
*  that say, first off, you can't hide these fees until the end of the transaction.
*  You got to disclose them right away up front.
*  What the whole thing is going to cost.
*  And second off, there's some fees you can't charge at all, particularly you can't charge
*  parents to sit next to their kids.
*  So the way the administration envisions it, when you go to your favorite travel site,
*  now you would see like an itemized list of all the fees.
*  Like here's what it could actually cost and what it could actually add up to.
*  And you'll see it right away when you're comparing what it costs between certain airlines.
*  So you have a better sense of what would the final price be at the end compared to the
*  final price I'm seeing now.
*  OK.
*  It's difficult, Jim, for me to imagine anyone not welcoming this kind of a rule.
*  I mean, it's the equivalent of free ice cream on Friday in the office.
*  Nobody is going to like this rule.
*  Right.
*  I mean, and that would seem to be the point.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a big reason why Biden and his administration are doing this.
*  They are leaning into helping consumers with something that really annoys them.
*  And that's part of a bigger push.
*  Biden has made a real concerted effort across the last few years to target what his administration
*  calls junk fees, which are just particular fees and hidden costs that dog you in all
*  sorts of parts of your life as a consumer and that just annoy people.
*  This is just a pattern of Biden saying, I'm going to tell corporate America you can't
*  hide these fees or in some cases you can't charge the fees that you've been charging.
*  But for Biden in the last few months, this push on junk fees has taken on a much larger
*  importance than just pleasing the crowds.
*  What do you mean?
*  It has become one of his go to ways of trying to show Americans that he's working to solve
*  what everybody says is their biggest economic problem right now, which is high prices.
*  In other words, inflation.
*  But of course, fees for an airline ticket and scene aren't exactly inflation.
*  No, this is not tackling the big drivers of inflation.
*  The prices that people are upset about, which have risen very fast under Joe Biden compared
*  to previous presidents, are things like groceries and housing and restaurant meals and cars,
*  trucks, the things you buy in a lot, basic necessities of day to day life.
*  Ticket fees and airline fees are a very, very small part of that.
*  But this is an area he can affect.
*  And so much else on inflation is not really under Biden's direct control, at least not in the short
*  term. And so tackling junk fees for the president has become a way to show Americans, hey, I'm
*  trying on an issue that he really can't do much about right now, but that is really dragging on
*  his presidency.
*  Got it.
*  You're saying that Joe Biden's crusade against fees is kind of a inflationary proxy battle.
*  If he can tackle fees and make people feel like he's in their corner when it comes to these
*  hidden costs in their life that are so annoying and painful, then he's going to create a halo
*  effect in which inflation, this broader problem that he has less ability to conquer, will feel
*  perhaps less painful.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I mean, there is a larger strategy by the Biden administration to address what they call corporate
*  greed when it comes to prices.
*  But junk fees are the president's most concrete and kind of go to way of connecting with voters
*  on the issue.
*  It's like Biden and his brain trust built this nice little policy canoe early in his
*  administration.
*  You know, something that's like fun and gets you around a small waterway.
*  But now they're taking it to sea because people need to see that he's out there on the water
*  trying to get things done in the much bigger problem of inflation.
*  Right.
*  Why don't you walk us through what this crusade has looked like from the start?
*  If the airline fees are feeling like an end point and perhaps the marquee project of this effort,
*  where does it start and what kind of ground has it covered?
*  So Biden's push on junk fees starts in the summer of 2021.
*  And he issues this huge executive order sprawling about competition, all the ways he wants to
*  bring competition back to the U.S.
*  economy and embedded in there is the first route of a real action on junk fees, like
*  airline fees.
*  And driving that is this really deeply held theory among a lot of the president's economic
*  advisors that corporate America has gotten too much power when it comes to how it interacts
*  with consumers.
*  So this starts as an effort to improve the economy in ways that Biden's advisors really
*  think will be very helpful at the individual level and beyond.
*  Now, at the same time, two things happen.
*  One, inflation starts to really blow up that summer.
*  And two, polling starts to show that people really like the idea of going after corporate
*  America on hidden fees.
*  And so by 2022, in the midterm elections, when the president is being hammered by Republicans
*  on inflation, he turns around and starts talking on the campaign trail about going after corporate
*  America for junk fees.
*  This is the first signs of him sort of saying, OK, prices are high.
*  I'm fighting back.
*  I'm fighting big corporate America.
*  So politics is clearly and firmly at play here.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  OK.
*  And what kind of action does this start to translate into?
*  Well, it's Washington.
*  So these things take time.
*  But branches of the federal government start to propose and then eventually finalize rules
*  going after a whole host of hidden fees across various industries.
*  So, for example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau takes aim at overdraft fees for people
*  who have bank deposits.
*  If you bounce a check or try to make a payment and it's beyond what you have in your bank
*  account, the bank can charge you a fee.
*  Typically, right now for large banks, it's about $35 every time someone
*  overdraws their account.
*  So the Bureau proposes a rule that basically caps the amount that banks can charge for
*  an overdraft fee.
*  And the administration sees this as a way to help low income people with bank accounts
*  not get trapped in that cycle of overdrafts.
*  Got it.
*  OK, so that's bank fees.
*  What else?
*  Well, then there's also credit card late fees.
*  Right now, that first fee for the first time you miss a payment can be more than $30.
*  And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said that's too much.
*  And it issued a rule that capped those first time fees at $8.
*  And then, of course, there are concert ticket fees, which people might hate just as much
*  as they hate airline fees.
*  Right.
*  We've all been there.
*  You go to see a show and book tickets or see a baseball game and you go to check out in
*  your cart and there are several fees just tacked on the end that you don't even know
*  what they are.
*  And the administration knows this makes people mad.
*  Biden says he's going to go after it.
*  And he ends up procuring a summit with Ticketmaster and Live Nation at the White House
*  where they announced that they're going to disclose those fees upfront right away at
*  the start.
*  So in this case, the government didn't need to issue any kind of new rule.
*  It just needed to invoke the power of public shaming.
*  Well, there's just real pressure coming from Biden and from his administration on this.
*  And so there's a voluntary action by some big players here in the industry to go along
*  with it.
*  Got it.
*  So when you put all this together from going after overdraft fees, credit card late fees,
*  ticket fees, and of course, the airline fees, this starts to add up to something pretty
*  meaningful sounding.
*  Yeah, it starts to add up to what you could call like a platform.
*  Right.
*  This is this is a series of things that Biden can now package together and say, look, I
*  am fighting for you, the consumer against big evil corporations that want to hide fees
*  and rip you off.
*  And as Biden starts pointing toward his reelection bid and entering this year, looking ahead
*  to November, a big economic speed bump happens for him.
*  Inflation had been coming down, but at the start of this year, it kind of goes sideways.
*  It's not coming down in the way that it had been or that the White House wants it to be.
*  And so Biden needs a new narrative.
*  He needs a new way to sort of commiserate with Americans about the damage of high prices
*  while also showing he's doing something to help.
*  Right.
*  And as you've said, he has his crackdown on fees.
*  He's got this canoe.
*  It's just sitting there in the water.
*  And so they decide to trick it out and take it back out again.
*  Good evening.
*  If I were smart, I'd go home now.
*  You could see the importance of junk fees to Biden's overall message about fighting
*  corporations and trying to bring down inflation in this year's State of the Union address.
*  Look, I'm also getting rid of junk fees.
*  Hidden fees.
*  When he gives the issue six paragraphs of space, several applause lines.
*  My administration announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8.
*  Talks about going after credit card companies, talks about going after late fees.
*  I'm not stopping there.
*  And promises that he's going to do more.
*  My administration has proposed rules to make cable, travel, utilities, and online ticket sellers
*  tell you the total price upfront.
*  He's going to go after utilities and he's going to go after cables fees.
*  And, you know, the battle to fight big corporate America on the issue of fees that annoy voters
*  is just begun.
*  It matters.
*  It matters.
*  Right.
*  Joe Biden, fee slayer.
*  Exactly.
*  But then something happens that is on its face a little bit of a policy setback for Biden,
*  but politically looks like a gift, which is these big corporations he's targeting in the
*  junk fee fight, they decide to fight back.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Jim, how are these industries trying to fight back against Biden's crusade against
*  fees and how is it benefiting Biden?
*  Well, the fighting back part is easy.
*  They are suing Biden and his administration in federal court.
*  They are trying to get judges to stop the implementation of these regulations.
*  So take, for example, the credit card companies, the banks, they are suing saying,
*  hey, this is politics.
*  This is not what the law allows.
*  And the federal government just does not have the authority to intervene and set these low
*  limits on how much we can charge in a private transaction for people with a credit card.
*  So it's a very traditional business argument against government regulation.
*  And just recently, a judge in Texas agreed with them and paused the regulation while
*  the lawsuit proceeds.
*  And the airlines are making a similar argument.
*  They're suing Biden as well.
*  They're trying to stop this fee disclosure rule.
*  And they're saying, again, this is way beyond the authority of the transportation department.
*  It cannot intervene in our private marketplace like this.
*  It doesn't have the authority.
*  They're also saying that this regulation will confuse consumers by giving them too
*  much information.
*  If you see all of these fees listed in the beginning, it could be confusing.
*  You might not really know what's going on.
*  That's their argument.
*  Okay.
*  Just to be clear, they're arguing that more information on fees and more transparent
*  information on fees might confuse airline consumers more than when those fees were hit.
*  Yeah, they're saying, look, we tell you what those fees are before you buy the ticket.
*  You get asked to pay for the seat as part of the ticket selection process.
*  And so they're saying it'd be confusing to people to give them all that information right
*  up front as opposed to throughout the process.
*  Intriguing.
*  And by the way, you can see in these complaints some of the reasons why Biden's aides think
*  this is a good political fight for them to have.
*  You know, when you have big companies saying, we think it will confuse our consumers to
*  give them more information up front, that's the sort of thing that the president's team
*  says, aha, we have a good villain here.
*  We have people who seem like they are trying to hide something from consumers and we can
*  be on the side of defending them.
*  Right.
*  The villains in this story are acting a little bit villainous, which makes the argument for
*  Biden.
*  That is the way the Biden people see it.
*  Right.
*  The Biden people see this as with these lawsuits and with their arguments that the big corporations
*  are showing themselves to consumers to be exactly the sort of people consumers want
*  the president to stand up to.
*  And so that is sort of the political situation where the president sees advantage right now.
*  I'm curious, though, if these industries, credit card industry, airline industry, have
*  a strong legal case here.
*  I know that you're not a lawyer, but are they in any way right that the administration has
*  overstepped the law or tested the bounds of the law by going after these fees?
*  Well, I would defer to my court reporter colleagues on the exact merits of the lawsuit.
*  But I will say that, yes, the Biden administration is pushing what we previously had seen as the
*  boundaries of where the federal government would intervene on these measures.
*  I mean, there's a reason why Biden is able to do a quote junk fee crackdown, and it's
*  because there hasn't been a big crackdown before.
*  So that's always going to be an area where you're going to get a lot of litigation.
*  And it's certainly an area when I talk to business groups where they are really frustrated.
*  They feel like the president has gone well beyond the law and established norms.
*  And they see this as really overreaching regulation that costs companies a lot of money,
*  both to defend in court and to comply with.
*  So I don't think it's any surprise whatsoever that we have a legal fight here, given the
*  sort of freshness of this fight picked by this president.
*  Got it.
*  OK, so pretty clearly, Biden is not out on a political limb, but he may be out on a legal
*  one.
*  The strategy may not work.
*  And I want to turn to what the risks of this strategy may be for Biden.
*  It would seem that the biggest risk is that it doesn't work.
*  And therefore, Biden has made a lot of promises in very prominent places like state of the
*  union speeches that he can't keep.
*  Courts end up blocking these plans.
*  And since this is, as you said from the beginning of our conversation, a kind of proxy battle
*  for inflation, Biden doesn't end up making much progress in changing how voters feel
*  about their economic situation.
*  And that would be a real problem for him.
*  Yes, it would.
*  Now, I actually don't think it's a huge risk to Biden if courts block these moves,
*  politically speaking.
*  Obviously, it will be frustrating for his policy team.
*  But the bigger risk for Biden here, to go back to our canoe analogy, is that he's going
*  to load up the canoe, voters are going to like the canoe, and then it's going to get
*  out in the sea and they're going to realize, wait, this is this is not the craft that you
*  take to cross the ocean.
*  Right.
*  The risk here flows from the fact that cracking down on junk fees is not an actual strategy
*  to bring down the inflation rate.
*  It will help on the margins, maybe, of some things that Americans pay, some costs that
*  Americans pay.
*  But it's not going to bring your rent down.
*  It's not going to make groceries cheaper in the store.
*  It's not going to soothe several years of frustration over high prices.
*  And to be fair, the Federal Reserve is the one who really is in charge of bringing inflation
*  down.
*  Not Joe Biden.
*  But the risk is that he's taking some ownership of the issue and saying, this is my strategy.
*  And voters go, wait, that's it?
*  That's that's the whole strategy.
*  We're crossing the ocean in this canoe.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  The risk you're saying is that this strategy is exposed for what it kind of is, which is
*  a side squabble rather than the real battle against inflation.
*  Yes.
*  And the president is really struggling to convince Americans that he feels their pain
*  on inflation.
*  The polls show Americans are very upset about high prices and they blame Biden for it.
*  So this may be the best thing he's got to try to go out and sell the idea that, hey,
*  I'm doing something that you like standing up to companies that you don't like in order
*  to fight the high prices that you are really upset about, even though you and I both know
*  that that's not enough on its own to solve your rent, solve your groceries, solve everything
*  else.
*  Right.
*  As Donald Rumsfeld might say, you go with the canoe that you've got.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, Jim, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you very much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In the hush money trial of Donald Trump, the defense rested its case on Tuesday without
*  calling the former president to the stand.
*  The possibility of Trump testifying was always an open question, but in the end, his lawyers
*  decided that it was not worth the risk.
*  Closing arguments in the case, the first criminal trial of a president will begin on Tuesday.
*  After that, the jury will begin their deliberations.
