# How a Skeptical Critic Came to Love Hallmark Christmas Movies
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=7.84s)]
*  Today, the story of how a big city culture critic, Amanda Hess, found love where she [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=12.0s)]
*  least expected it, in the monotony of Hallmark's Christmas movies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=22.92s)]
*  It's Tuesday, December 24th. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=38.56s)]
*  Amanda, thank you for coming into the studio. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=43.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=50.44s)]
*  This is your first time on the show. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=52.4s)]
*  This is the thing we get to do at the end of the year. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=53.76s)]
*  We get to bring on everybody who's never been on the show, but who we secretly have wanted [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=55.4s)]
*  to be on the show. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=59.48s)]
*  This is my Christmas wish come true. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=60.48s)]
*  You write about culture for The Times, you're a critic, and you're here today to talk about [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=64.56s)]
*  a subject that, I'll be honest, I don't think I or many of us on the show ever imagined [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=71.56s)]
*  might be an episode of The Daily. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=78.16s)]
*  You are going to be providing an exploration, a meditation, whatever you want to call it, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=81.96s)]
*  a kind of study of the made-for-TV Christmas movie, which you contend has not quite gotten [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=86.44s)]
*  the critical attention that it deserves. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  And specifically, you're going to be talking to us here about that most familiar brand [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  of made-for-TV Christmas movie, the Hallmark Channel Christmas movie. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  That is our subject today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=108.6s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=111.8s)]
*  I wasn't always this way. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=116.24s)]
*  I think I was always interested in Hallmark Christmas movies on a meta level, but I was [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  not interested in sitting down and watching them for an hour and a half. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=126.0s)]
*  Or talking about them on The Daily. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=129.48s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=130.48s)]
*  But that changed this year. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=131.68s)]
*  And now I still think they're bad, but I really like watching them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=134.6s)]
*  Well, before we get to how you became this person who watches these movies, I want you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=140.88s)]
*  to describe, especially for the unacquainted, this entire universe of made-for-TV movies. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=149.16s)]
*  Just give us a little bit of background about it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=156.88s)]
*  Well, like you said, we're really talking about a category that was pioneered by the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=158.96s)]
*  Hallmark Channel and is still dominated by that channel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  Hallmark produces dozens of these made-for-TV Christmas movies every year. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=168.4s)]
*  In 2024, they released 32 of them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=173.68s)]
*  And one can imagine that they're not putting a huge amount of production into these movies. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=178.44s)]
*  They kind of seem like they each have the budget for one snow flurry movie. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=186.12s)]
*  One fake snowstorm horror film. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=193.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  What are the names of some of these movies, just so we know what we're talking about here? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=197.92s)]
*  Let me pull up a list of them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=202.88s)]
*  Lucky Christmas, The Case for Christmas, A Christmas Wedding Tale, that one's about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  dogs, A Christmas Wish, Holiday Engagement, The Christmas Patches, Christmas Magic, Christmas [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  Song, Matchmaker Santa, It's Christmas, Carol. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=214.32s)]
*  It's Christmas, comma, Carol. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=221.16s)]
*  There's not a lot of variation in this titling. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=222.72s)]
*  No, these movies are very similar to each other. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=225.96s)]
*  So I want to now dive into this journey that you have been on with these movies. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  What had been your relationship to them up until quite recently? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=236.08s)]
*  When I first became aware of them, I thought they were very stupid. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=241.84s)]
*  They seemed anti-feminist to me and really, really sentimental. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=246.12s)]
*  Have you watched a lot of them? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=251.76s)]
*  I had seen maybe a combined five minutes of these movies, but it was enough to understand [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=254.72s)]
*  what was happening. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=260.64s)]
*  And the women always seemed to exist only to fall in love. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=262.12s)]
*  Like they would throw away their entire lives, like as soon as they were touched by the magic [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=266.2s)]
*  of Christmas. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=269.76s)]
*  But then, as the narrator of a movie might say, one fateful day, things change for you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=271.0s)]
*  So tell us that story. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=278.04s)]
*  So a couple of months ago, I learned that someone I know who's an actor in New York [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=280.68s)]
*  appeared in a Hallmark Christmas movie. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  And the next time I saw him, I was interrogating him about it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  I was like, did you wear a scarf? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=292.2s)]
*  Did you wear a flannel shirt? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=293.88s)]
*  How many costume changes did you have? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=295.32s)]
*  What colors were you wearing? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=297.16s)]
*  Did they use the same set for every Christmas movie and just turn it over? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  And as I was asking him this, he said, do you like Hallmark Christmas movies? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=303.72s)]
*  And I said, no, even though clearly I was very interested in them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=308.72s)]
*  And so I decided that this year maybe I would actually watch a few of them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=314.68s)]
*  And it turned out that by the time I sat down to do that, I was in this place in November [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  where someone very close to me had a health scare and they ended up being completely fine. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=326.42s)]
*  But there was like a week where I was waiting for test results to come back. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  The worst week ever. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=338.72s)]
*  Yeah, I was so frozen as a person. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=340.48s)]
*  And I really needed to find something to watch that was really uncomplicated and easy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=346.48s)]
*  And I found that there was nothing easier than watching these Christmas movies. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=354.4s)]
*  And I came out of the experience really starting to like them. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=358.88s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=363.2s)]
*  Well, just explain that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=364.4s)]
*  I mean, unpack for us why these movies were such a balm for you in this vulnerable moment. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=365.92s)]
*  Well, so they do have this very recognizable formula and there are some variations. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  But in the classic one, there's a big city woman who's in her 30s, which in these movies [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=382.32s)]
*  is like she's getting a little long in the tooth. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=387.68s)]
*  Like, you know, she needs to find love fast. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=390.0s)]
*  But she has her career that she loves. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=393.04s)]
*  Marianne, why do you think it is you and I are the top female lawyers in the city? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=395.68s)]
*  Because we never give up. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=400.8s)]
*  I thought you were going to say because we're very powerful independent women [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=403.2s)]
*  who don't rely on anyone to do our dirty work. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=406.48s)]
*  Even though she's a little miserable in it deep down. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=408.88s)]
*  We're looking for unique individuals whose lifestyles are flexible and can keep up with the demand. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=411.52s)]
*  That sounds like me in every way. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=416.08s)]
*  Great. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=418.16s)]
*  So what I really need to know is how available are you? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=418.64s)]
*  I'm very, very available. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=422.32s)]
*  Even during the holidays? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=424.16s)]
*  What about family, partner, household pets? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=426.08s)]
*  Are they OK with this? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=428.8s)]
*  I'm kind of a one woman band. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=430.72s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=432.48s)]
*  Then I have a flight for you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=433.12s)]
*  For some bizarre reason, she needs to go back to her hometown. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=434.56s)]
*  I don't think anybody's going to be getting through this until it dissipates. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  Suggest you find a place to land before you're out over the ocean. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=442.24s)]
*  Like she's a pilot and she's forced to do an emergency landing on Christmas Island. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=445.2s)]
*  Attention, this is your captain, Kate Gabriel. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=450.88s)]
*  Due to severe weather conditions over the Atlantic, we are making a temporary stop in Nova Scotia. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=453.76s)]
*  Canada? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=459.84s)]
*  So much for our easy flight to Europe. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  Or she is forced to go to Scotland for Christmas because her mother [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=463.52s)]
*  has unexpectedly inherited a castle there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=467.36s)]
*  30,000. This place is 30,000 acres. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=470.88s)]
*  Did you know your family has 30 bathrooms? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  Why does anyone need 30 bathrooms? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=476.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=478.0s)]
*  You know, whatever it is. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=478.56s)]
*  Hey, it's me. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=480.0s)]
*  So believe it or not, I am driving down Main Street. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=481.36s)]
*  Yep, I'm home. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  Unless we have so much to catch up on. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  She goes to this small town and they all look eerily similar. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=487.6s)]
*  There's this quaint town square. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you know, most people come here for the lighthouse, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=494.48s)]
*  but I think this street is pretty special. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  That's always very festively decorated for Christmas. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=501.68s)]
*  And that is how Grandin Falls got her nickname. Christmas Town. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=506.64s)]
*  And there's just like a random, like really hot guy who she runs into, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=511.2s)]

*  Just watch your step there. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=520.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=521.68s)]
*  He might be a handsome woodworker. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=522.72s)]
*  It's not very far. I'm just gonna walk. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=524.88s)]
*  You didn't let me walk with you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=526.24s)]
*  I just have to put some tools away and lock up. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=527.92s)]
*  Or an unassuming groundskeeper. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=530.64s)]
*  Who leads a ladder just standing around? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=536.56s)]
*  Oh. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=537.92s)]
*  And once they go in his house, even though he's like a 36 to 42 year old single man, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=538.48s)]
*  it's always aggressively decorated for Christmas. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=545.52s)]
*  Here we are. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=551.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=554.64s)]
*  Nick, this is beautiful. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=556.48s)]
*  It's supposed to have taken you days. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  And as they embark on some kind of Christmas task together, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=560.24s)]
*  whether it's solving the mystery of a missing ornament that will unlock a [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=567.5200000000001s)]
*  genealogical mystery for this woman's family. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=573.44s)]
*  This is grandma's tradition. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=577.0400000000001s)]
*  It's an incredible gift she's given me. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  Or they need to turn around a struggling music venue so that her parents can save it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=581.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, I need you to declare one of these holiday IPAs as perfect. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=586.72s)]
*  Otherwise, it might just be game over for Mobile Joe's. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=591.44s)]
*  Not bad, huh? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=594.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, now that I know the stakes, let's do this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=596.48s)]
*  They fall in love. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=600.24s)]
*  But there's some impediment to their love. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=601.84s)]
*  Usually it has something to do with the woman having to go back to the big city. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  Andy, I'm leaving for Seattle in the morning. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=608.64s)]
*  I called your mom and I'm staying with her tonight. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=611.52s)]
*  I think it's for the best. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=613.84s)]
*  She has to make a big decision as to whether she's going to return to her old life in her career, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=615.44s)]
*  or she's going to start her new life, which is based in this new relationship. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=619.84s)]
*  She goes to the airport, she gets in the car, and then... [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=624.8s)]
*  Grandma, turn the car around. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=628.0s)]
*  You know, she asks the driver to turn the car around. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  I can figure out how to run my own practice. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=632.0799999999999s)]
*  I can figure out how to make this work. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  And often the small town man presents her with a seasonally appropriate necklace. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=635.04s)]
*  Traditionally, you're not supposed to open Christmas presents till midnight. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=641.52s)]
*  Then I've never been much for tradition. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=646.16s)]
*  Oh, Charles. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=650.24s)]
*  May I? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=652.56s)]
*  And there's usually a scene where he puts the necklace on, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=653.78s)]
*  and maybe he'll adjust it on her collarbone or something. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=657.4599999999999s)]
*  And then they fall in love. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=662.42s)]
*  This, of course, is a moment of physicality and a blossoming love. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=663.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the closest... [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=670.7399999999999s)]
*  It's a release. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=671.8599999999999s)]
*  It's the closest that they're going to come to having sex in this movie. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=672.5s)]
*  And she stays in Hallmark land forever, presumably. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=676.9s)]
*  They kiss and then the movie's over, so we don't really know what happens after that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=681.46s)]
*  Merry Christmas, Annie. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=685.14s)]
*  Merry Christmas, Will. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=686.82s)]
*  I mean, these are pretty cliched plot lines. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=700.5s)]
*  So what was it about this formula that you just described that serves you so well? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=703.86s)]
*  Back in November, when you start watching this. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=711.62s)]
*  There's something really satisfying about them hitting every single one of the beats [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=714.98s)]
*  every single time over and over again for hundreds and hundreds of movies. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=719.94s)]
*  There's very little variation, and it's kind of like completing a paint-by-numbers craft. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=726.5s)]
*  I started to get really invested in predicting when the next [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=735.7s)]
*  predictable plot point was going to happen. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=740.58s)]
*  And I think at this point, if I watched a Hallmark Christmas movie [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=742.58s)]
*  and they went back to the man's house and it was not decorated for Christmas, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=745.86s)]
*  I would be pissed. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=750.1s)]
*  And I would be like, this woman needs to get out of there because he's a psycho. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=751.78s)]
*  She needs to leave right now. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=755.62s)]
*  And so I think I just became so versed in the cliches of the world that I [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=757.62s)]
*  began to find them comforting. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=762.18s)]
*  I didn't want anything dramatic to happen. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=765.38s)]
*  I didn't want anything surprising to happen or stressful. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=767.78s)]
*  I was already feeling enough of that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=772.7399999999999s)]
*  And so you didn't want much to be demanded of you. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=774.18s)]
*  Yeah, I wanted everything to be firmly predictable. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=777.3s)]
*  And it was. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=782.42s)]
*  I'm thinking back to what you said at the beginning of this conversation, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=783.9399999999999s)]
*  which is that when you were not as familiar with these films and when you were not in [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=786.26s)]
*  an acute phase of being very open to them because of this medical situation happening around you, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=791.38s)]
*  you found them to be anti-feminist. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=797.62s)]
*  And if I'm reading the room correctly, you thought you were a little bit better [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=799.86s)]
*  than these movies. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=804.26s)]
*  And yet you go through this phase where you're very open to them. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=805.86s)]
*  They are this solution to something and you've warmed to them a lot. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=809.7s)]
*  So what does that tell us not just about these movies and their formula, but about you? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=813.86s)]
*  What did you learn about yourself? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=819.62s)]
*  I think I've been beaten down enough by life at this point to be more open to sentimental things. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=823.7800000000001s)]
*  I think when I first learned about these movies maybe 15 years ago, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=832.2600000000001s)]
*  my career was my identity. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=835.7s)]
*  I was not unlike one of these hallmark heroines. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=837.94s)]
*  And so now- [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=841.1400000000001s)]
*  Big city girl. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=842.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=843.3000000000001s)]
*  Now, I can see the appeal of moving to Christmastown, USA and giving it all up. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=844.74s)]
*  But also I realized once I actually watched the movies that typically it's not that the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=851.46s)]
*  woman just quits her job in order to do nothing and to be barefoot and pregnant with her new [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=857.06s)]
*  woodworking husband's baby. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=864.98s)]
*  She is quitting her big city job for this idealized form of work that's inherently [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=867.86s)]
*  creative and meaningful. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=875.54s)]
*  She's running a candy cane shop or she's taking over a small town diner. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=878.74s)]
*  And so she's still working, but she has a job that- [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=884.98s)]
*  Is more connected to a place. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=889.9399999999999s)]
*  A kind of job that maybe is less and less likely to exist. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=892.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=896.02s)]
*  And she's finding a different kind of fulfillment than the big city media kind of world. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=896.9s)]
*  Just to name an example. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=902.66s)]
*  So I guess in your affection for these movies you learn that you have changed and in the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=904.42s)]
*  ways that you have changed you identify more with these larger questions and perhaps even critiques [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=911.6999999999999s)]
*  of modern ambition and quote unquote success. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=919.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I definitely know now more than I did before that like work is not going to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=923.9399999999999s)]
*  love you back. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=930.98s)]
*  I don't think that means that necessarily a small town air traffic controller is going to love you [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=932.42s)]
*  back or a small town groundskeeper is going to love you back, but I'm more open to watching a [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=940.02s)]
*  movie where that is the case. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=944.74s)]
*  I mean it's also true that like when I first became aware of these movies the actor seemed [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=948.5799999999999s)]
*  really old, but now I am old and so they're usually a little bit younger than me now. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=953.78s)]
*  And so I've definitely just aged into the category. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=959.94s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=977.3000000000001s)]
*  What does the critic in you make of this journey that you have been on from skeptic and maybe even [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=982.98s)]
*  slightly disdainful skeptic to maybe not even all that grudging a fan? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=993.7s)]
*  Well I think of my journey as somewhat of a romantic comedy plot where in a rom-com [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1000.66s)]
*  one party ups his game and one party lowers her defenses until they meet on level ground and they [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1007.8599999999999s)]
*  can have a relationship and that's what's happened here. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1015.54s)]
*  That's you and the Hallmark holiday movie? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  I've definitely gotten softer as a person and more open to what they're selling, but they have also [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1021.38s)]
*  gotten a little bit more cynical and a little more arch and they're selling themselves more [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1026.34s)]
*  aggressively to people like me. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1031.1399999999999s)]
*  Just explain that. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1032.58s)]
*  How have they gotten a little bit more arched? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1033.3s)]
*  Because from everything you're saying the formula is faithful and not arch. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1035.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1041.38s)]
*  So the formula remains the same, but there are new entrants to the category that are putting [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1042.18s)]
*  little twists on it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1047.38s)]
*  The big one is Netflix. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1048.3400000000001s)]
*  So Netflix is now a Christmas movie generator of its own and its movies tend to be marketed [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1049.8600000000001s)]
*  a little bit more as comedies. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1059.5400000000002s)]
*  So there's still romances, but there's a little bit more of an emphasis on the comedy. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1061.78s)]
*  Remember that muscular snowman from the Snow Sculpture Festival? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1067.46s)]
*  And so in Hot Frosty for example. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1070.98s)]
*  Which has been emblazoned across my Netflix homepage. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1073.7s)]
*  Yes, it's hard to avoid. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1076.66s)]
*  So he says he doesn't remember anything before last night. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1078.26s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1081.54s)]
*  I was a snowman. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1082.82s)]
*  That's definitely not good. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1084.34s)]
*  It's a movie about a snowman who becomes a real person. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1086.98s)]
*  How could you possibly trust me? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1091.78s)]
*  Because you put the scarf on me. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1093.94s)]
*  And falls in love with Lucy Schabert. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1095.94s)]
*  So there's the remote, the power on and off. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1098.1s)]
*  There's a moment where Hot Frosty is learning everything about the human world by watching [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1100.74s)]
*  television. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1106.34s)]
*  And one of the things he watches is a previous Netflix Christmas movie. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1111.06s)]
*  And so there is some acknowledgement of the idea that this is a category that even if people [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1116.3400000000001s)]
*  love to watch these movies, they may still like to poke a little bit of fun at them. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1124.18s)]
*  Right, it's winking at itself. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1128.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1129.3s)]
*  Netflix has also made their Christmas movies a little bit more risque. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1129.94s)]
*  I got you some clothes, but you're gonna have to try them on. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1133.7s)]
*  Oh, no, not right now. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1136.5s)]
*  Got it. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1138.1s)]
*  So there's usually a shirtless man who's romping around the Christmas wonderland. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1139.3s)]
*  And for some bizarre reason. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1146.1s)]
*  It's gonna be a Christmas spectacular full of hot up and coming men. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1148.82s)]
*  There's a movie called The Merry Gentlemen, which is basically Magic Mike meets Christmas. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1156.1799999999998s)]
*  There's just, there's gotta be a way to get people excited about this place again. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1160.6599999999999s)]
*  Did you think male strippers are the answer? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1164.58s)]
*  A bunch of local men need to put on an erotic male review in order to save a local bar. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1167.14s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1175.7800000000002s)]
*  A little spice on the old Hallmark formula. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1177.5400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1181.14s)]
*  Oh my God, you're naked. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1181.64s)]
*  Okay, first of all, my shirt was dry. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1183.22s)]
*  You can imagine that the cable Hallmark channel audience is probably a little different than the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1186.26s)]
*  Netflix streaming audience. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1193.38s)]
*  And it does seem like Netflix's Christmas offerings are meeting its audience where they're at a little [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1194.98s)]
*  bit more. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1201.3000000000002s)]
*  So there are more like sexual situations, even if there's not like a sex scene. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1202.2600000000002s)]
*  There are more jokes. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1208.2600000000002s)]
*  There are more actors that you might recognize from sitcoms. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1209.7800000000002s)]
*  So it really does seem like Netflix is specifically seeding its movies with millennial bait. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1214.3400000000001s)]
*  Especially because the actor who now is most associated with Netflix holiday movies is Lindsay [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1223.8600000000001s)]
*  Lohan. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1231.22s)]
*  And she, I think more than anyone else has been kind of the avatar of millennial girlhood and then [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1233.0600000000002s)]
*  teenhood and now middle age, unfortunately, is where we are at. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1240.2600000000002s)]
*  So Amanda, when you finished this exercise of immersing yourself in the world of these [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1247.22s)]
*  holiday movies this fall and now into this winter, you ended up writing about it in an essay [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1253.7800000000002s)]
*  that ran in the Times entitled How I Aged into the Bad Christmas Movie. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1260.8200000000002s)]
*  What was the response to that essay? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1267.0600000000002s)]
*  I got a stronger response to that essay than any other piece I've ever written. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1271.0600000000002s)]
*  Ever? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1276.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1277.22s)]
*  And when I wrote the story, because I am making a bit of fun at these movies, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1278.2s)]
*  I was curious whether fans of them would be upset with me. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1284.2s)]
*  And it turns out that a lot of people are watching these movies in the same mode that I'm [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1288.04s)]
*  watching them. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1293.4s)]
*  Which is to say, as a formulaic escape, as a predictable way of navigating a challenging [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1294.28s)]
*  time. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1302.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1302.92s)]
*  Is there one of these emails that stands out to you? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1304.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to find it. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1308.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1310.6000000000001s)]
*  Dear Amanda, I watched my first Hallmark Bad Christmas Movie that super cold Sunday the [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1311.24s)]
*  other week. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1316.44s)]
*  While I meant to do some things around the house as I was not venturing outside, I saw [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1317.24s)]
*  our fat kitty on the couch looking for a belly rub, sat down, and turned on the television. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1321.16s)]
*  Randomly scrolling through the channels, I came across the start of a Christmas movie [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1326.44s)]
*  on the Hallmark Channel. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1330.04s)]
*  My mom was always a fan and watched them religiously. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1331.56s)]
*  She passed last year at 90, and for whatever reason, I felt compelled to watch. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1335.08s)]
*  Boy was it bad. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1340.68s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1343.56s)]
*  And watched another right after it and cried. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1344.84s)]
*  Thank you for the article. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1348.6s)]
*  Spot on for me. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1349.72s)]
*  Best to you, Amanda. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1351.08s)]
*  You rock. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1352.44s)]
*  Judy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1353.6399999999999s)]
*  She's describing this as a kind of inheritance. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1354.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a new kind of tradition. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1357.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1360.92s)]
*  I want another. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1361.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1362.28s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1363.74s)]
*  Here's another that I really liked. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1365.18s)]
*  Hi, Amanda. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1367.34s)]
*  I've never written to a journalist before. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1368.46s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1370.3799999999999s)]
*  Or written in the comments section, but I was compelled to do so by your article. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1370.94s)]
*  Boy, do I feel old this holiday season. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1375.02s)]
*  LOL. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1377.34s)]
*  I had the exact same reaction you did about a week ago. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1378.3s)]
*  I'm currently undergoing IVF and had my embryo transfer Tuesday. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1381.5s)]
*  And as part of my lay low routine, I watched every single good bad Christmas movie on [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1386.06s)]
*  Netflix. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1390.3s)]
*  By hot frosty, I was like, wow, what happened to me? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1391.26s)]
*  When did I reach this low? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1395.74s)]
*  How can they keep a straight face? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1397.42s)]
*  Why can't I look away? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1398.86s)]
*  I am their target demographic. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1400.86s)]
*  Thanks, XX Alejandra. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1403.74s)]
*  That is literally the mirror image of what happened to you. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1406.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1410.78s)]
*  Whenever I write anything, I think I'm like, I'm so odd. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1411.66s)]
*  No one could ever relate to me. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1414.94s)]
*  There's something wrong with me. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1418.14s)]
*  And I found out in this case that that's definitely not true. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1419.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1423.18s)]
*  You're more universal than you maybe give yourself credit for. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1424.14s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1426.78s)]
*  In listening to you read those emails and assuming that there's dozens more like them [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1428.0600000000002s)]
*  in your inbox, it occurs to me that the phenomenon you're experiencing here is not that complicated. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1432.5400000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1439.98s)]
*  And maybe in the beginning, you overcomplicated the whole thing with your view of these movies. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1440.38s)]
*  And you should have never doubted their value. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1447.66s)]
*  I mean, we do at the New York Times tend to fetishize complexity, right? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1450.8600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1456.94s)]
*  In arts and in culture. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1457.44s)]
*  But complex doesn't always make for a comforting ritual because life is pretty complicated [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1460.06s)]
*  as it is. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1466.46s)]
*  So maybe the movies don't have to be. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1467.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1469.18s)]
*  I think at the beginning, I was thinking the existence of these movies fascinates me. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1469.66s)]
*  But they're so bad and I would never watch them. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1477.1000000000001s)]
*  And I should have just been more comfortable stopping at these movies fascinate me. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1479.5s)]
*  There were many years that I could have been enjoying these hundreds of movies that I chose not to. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1485.5800000000002s)]
*  So what is the future here between you and this brand of movie? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1490.46s)]
*  Is this like a forever thing? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1495.18s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1498.7s)]
*  I sound so depressed when I say that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1501.74s)]
*  I mean, I think, you know, it's like none of these movies will become my classic Christmas movie that I watch every year. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1503.9s)]
*  But I will watch a movie that is nearly identical when it comes out next year. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1511.5s)]
*  I'll watch 12 of them. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1517.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, to put this very simply, they've got you. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1518.94s)]
*  They got me. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1523.1000000000001s)]
*  You didn't want to be gotten, but you got. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1525.02s)]
*  No, they won me over. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1526.78s)]
*  And I'm in love. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1527.98s)]
*  Well, Amanda, thank you very much for being here. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1533.66s)]
*  As it happens, this is the last episode that we are going to be running of The Daily before Christmas Day. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1541.8200000000002s)]
*  So Merry Christmas to you. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1550.14s)]
*  Merry Christmas to you. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1552.38s)]
*  And thank you for coming. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1554.0600000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1555.5s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1564.6200000000001s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1570.0600000000002s)]
*  On Monday, President Biden commuted the sentences of nearly all prisoners on federal death row, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1573.02s)]
*  meaning that they will instead serve life sentences without parole. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1579.1000000000001s)]
*  The decision prevents President-elect Trump from ordering the prisoners executions as he has promised to do. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1583.5s)]
*  Biden campaigned on ending the federal death penalty and ordered that such executions be [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1590.78s)]
*  stopped during his presidency. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1596.3799999999999s)]
*  Still, he did not commute the sentences of three notorious death row prisoners who were convicted [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1598.7s)]
*  of hate-motivated mass murder and terrorism, including the Boston Marathon bomber. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1604.9399999999998s)]
*  And a highly anticipated report by the House Ethics Committee found that [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1613.8999999999999s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman from Florida, regularly paid for sex, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1618.7s)]
*  had sexual relations with an underage girl, and used illegal drugs. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1624.6200000000001s)]
*  Gaetz, who resigned from Congress last month, was Trump's pick to run the Department of Justice [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1629.9s)]
*  before he withdrew over accusations that were largely confirmed by the House Ethics Report. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1635.42s)]
*  Gaetz, for his part, denies any wrongdoing. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1641.02s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Alex Stern, and Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1648.94s)]
*  It was edited by Rachel Quester, with help from Lexi Diao. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1654.7s)]
*  Contains original music by Alisha Baitut and Diane Wong, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1659.42s)]
*  Our theme music is by Jim Runberg and Ben Landsferk of Wonderly. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1667.02s)]
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Bobauro. See you tomorrow. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWWoMFAh7sQ&t=1678.7s)]
