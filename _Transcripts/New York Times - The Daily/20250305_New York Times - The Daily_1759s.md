# Partisan Taunts and Defiant Protests: Trump’s First Speech to Congress
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobargo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=4.48s)]
*  In his first address to Congress on Tuesday night, President Trump took a highly partisan [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=11.84s)]
*  victory lap as Democratic lawmakers openly protested against him. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=17.76s)]
*  Today, my colleague Maggie Haberman walks us through the speech and the reactions to it in the room. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=25.36s)]
*  It's Wednesday, March 5th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=47.28s)]
*  So Maggie, are you ready to begin? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=55.92s)]
*  I am, Michael. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=57.92s)]
*  Okay. Well, thank you for joining us at 1140 p.m. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=59.04s)]
*  1141, and thank you for having me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=65.04s)]
*  Thank you for correcting my time stamping. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=67.68s)]
*  It don't only feel appropriate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=71.12s)]
*  So Maggie, describe the scene for us on the House floor as all of this gets underway on Tuesday night. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=73.68s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=82.72s)]
*  So Michael, about 15 minutes after 9 p.m., the announcement goes out that the President [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=88.64s)]
*  of the United States is going to be walking in. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=95.12s)]
*  Already, this is a different setting than we are used to for this kind of a speech, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=97.12s)]
*  because normally there is an escort committee. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  It's a bipartisan escort committee. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=105.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=107.28s)]
*  And Democrats help walk in the Republican president. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=107.6s)]
*  Republican members help walk in a Democratic president. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  This year, Democrats decided not to be part of that committee. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=114.0s)]
*  So right away, this was a new moment. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=116.96s)]
*  And newly partisan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=120.8s)]
*  And newly partisan. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  And there were other signs of Democratic protest. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  He's being applauded by Republicans who are trying to touch him as he's walking down the aisle. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  Most Democrats are refusing to stand, if any did. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=135.04s)]
*  I knew Sandy who did. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=137.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=138.56s)]
*  And usually both parties stand just out of respect for the office. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  For the most part, yes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  And it foretold a very, very intensely partisan night that was about to come. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=143.84s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=157.12s)]
*  It's a great honor. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  Speaker Johnson. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=162.0s)]
*  Trump reaches the lectern, and then he starts to speak. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=163.44000000000003s)]
*  Members of the United States Congress, thank you very much. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  And to my fellow citizens, America is back. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=172.8s)]
*  And there's huge cheers from Republicans. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  And Trump relives his election victory. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=189.44s)]
*  The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=192.0s)]
*  We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=200.8s)]
*  He claims falsely that his popular vote win was by a large margin. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=208.64s)]
*  It was not. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=215.28s)]
*  There was nothing historic about it other than that it happened. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=216.08s)]
*  But he seemed to be doing that deliberately, as he has in the past, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=219.76s)]
*  to suggest in this room before the entire country in this live televised address that he has a mandate. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=223.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  And he does have a mandate. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=230.64s)]
*  He just doesn't have the mandate that he keeps saying he does. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=231.76s)]
*  But so at that moment, as he's declaring this, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Al Green, who has been firmly against Trump for a very long time, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=239.2s)]
*  stands up and he starts to heckle the president. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=247.84s)]
*  And heckling is not as unusual as it once was for this kind of important speech. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=256.08s)]
*  But Green seemed to go further than your average heckler. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=263.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=268.56s)]
*  This was Green continuing to stand, literally waving his cane, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  brandishing it almost as if it was a sword, essentially, and refusing to sit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=274.72s)]
*  Members are directed to uphold and maintain the quorum in the House [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=284.8s)]
*  and to cease any further disruptions. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=289.04s)]
*  That's your warning. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  Despite repeated calls for him to do so by the House Speaker. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=293.12s)]
*  I should add, Maggie, I was watching this on television as well. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=296.72s)]
*  I noticed at this moment, not only that the Speaker is very frustrated, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=300.56s)]
*  JD Vance stands up and signals with his thumb that it's time to eject Congressman Green. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=304.64000000000004s)]
*  It was an astonishing moment. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=312.32s)]
*  And what Green was doing was astonishing too. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this was just a sustained protest in a chamber where decorum is valued. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=315.76s)]
*  But both JD Vance and House Speaker Mike Johnson, both of whom, because of their roles, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  were seated behind the President and standing at various points, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=328.24s)]
*  were trying to get the Sergeant-at-Arms attention to have that person come [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=331.44s)]
*  and eject a sitting member of Congress, which is an uncomfortable moment. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=336.32s)]
*  Take your seat. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=340.24s)]
*  Finding that members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=344.48s)]
*  the Chair now directs the Sergeant-at-Arms to restore order. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Which is exactly what ends up happening. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=355.04s)]
*  That is exactly what ends up happening. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=357.44s)]
*  And it gave Donald Trump a moment that he clearly wanted. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=359.12s)]
*  This is my fifth such speech to Congress. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=363.44s)]
*  And once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=370.24s)]
*  or to make them stand or smile or applaud. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=375.44s)]
*  Nothing I can do. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=378.64s)]
*  Trump was trying to set up this notion that whatever he does, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=379.76s)]
*  Democrats are going to oppose it, and therefore Democrats are unreasonable and bad actors. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=385.2s)]
*  And again, this is his perspective. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=391.28s)]
*  I'm just saying what he is trying to set up and that they are not going to endorse him no matter what. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=401.44s)]
*  After this set of back and forths between the President and unhappy Democrats, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=402.08s)]
*  we finally get to the meat of this speech. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=407.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=412.24s)]
*  So from that moment, Trump begins to describe the version of America that he defeated in 2024 [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=412.64s)]
*  in his telling and the one that he's sweeping away. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=420.4s)]
*  And it is one that, to use a word he uses often, is woke. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=423.36s)]
*  And what are the examples of this woke version of America that he's sweeping away? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=432.64s)]
*  It's a pretty familiar list, Michael, for anyone who has listened to a Trump campaign speech. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  It's culture war issues. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=441.52s)]
*  And I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  that there are only two genders, male and female. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=448.08s)]
*  It's men who have transitioned to be women playing in women's sports. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=452.79999999999995s)]
*  That's a big one that he focuses on. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=459.2s)]
*  He focuses specifically on a young woman in the audience, Peyton McNabb. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=466.32s)]
*  Three years ago, Peyton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=472.08s)]
*  Who was hit in the head with a spiked volleyball that was spiked by [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  a transgender woman on the opposing team. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=484.08s)]
*  He smashed the ball so hard in Peyton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=486.96s)]
*  partially paralyzing her right side. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=493.2s)]
*  Who apparently suffered a head injury because of it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=496.08s)]
*  Peyton is here tonight in the gallery and Peyton, from now on, schools will kick [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=498.96s)]
*  the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=504.08s)]
*  And then he pivots. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=510.4s)]
*  As you know, we inherited from the last administration [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=511.76s)]
*  an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=515.36s)]
*  Very abruptly to the government that he inherited. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=519.68s)]
*  And to that end, I have created the brand new department of government efficiency. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=524.88s)]
*  And he starts going through a list of programs and it's long, that he says are programs that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  Doge, Musk's effort, has identified as spending that Trump considers wasteful. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=544.88s)]
*  In many cases, it's foreign aid. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=552.16s)]
*  It's promoting efforts in Africa. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=558.56s)]
*  $8 million to promote LGBTQI plus in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  He sort of mocks the name of a country there. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=573.1999999999999s)]
*  He mispronounces another country. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=575.28s)]
*  He goes through this lengthy list and... [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=577.52s)]
*  $20 million for the Arab Sesame Street. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=580.56s)]
*  It's very hard to know how accurate this list is because a lot of what has been [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=584.16s)]
*  put out there by Doge as their cost cutting measures, some is accurate, some is not. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=593.28s)]
*  Asia is doing very well with learning. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=599.28s)]
*  He does all of this to laughter by JD Vance behind him, by Mike Johnson behind him, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=602.16s)]
*  by House members sitting on the Republican side of the aisle. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=608.48s)]
*  Under the Trump administration, all of these scams, and they're far worse, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=612.64s)]
*  but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=616.72s)]
*  They're so bad. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. He's very pointedly mocking the federal government in a pretty unfamiliar way for this [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  setting. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  Correct. And not just the federal government, but the federal bureaucracy, which is composed of [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=628.96s)]
*  workers. And in some cases, there are his supporters among people working in this government. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=635.04s)]
*  And he controls it and is going to have to figure out how to get people to respond to what he wants [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  without sounding disdainful of them. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=649.12s)]
*  And then it felt like he was turning the page from what he inherited and dislikes and wants [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  to sweep away, as you just put it, to this new vision for government that he's creating. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=659.6s)]
*  That's right. And the neon sign blinking for that new government is tariffs. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=665.84s)]
*  If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=673.36s)]
*  you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=677.6800000000001s)]
*  He imposed major tariffs on goods from Mexico and goods from Canada. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=681.84s)]
*  Right. These are tariffs he announced just hours before this speech. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=688.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Less than 24 hours before the speech started. And he makes clear that he's not [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=692.4799999999999s)]
*  only doing those tariffs, but that come the beginning of April. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=698.8s)]
*  The system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  there's going to be tariffs essentially around the globe in the form of reciprocal tariffs. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in. And whatever they tariff us, other countries, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=712.96s)]
*  we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  Which may inevitably increase costs for U.S. consumers. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=729.6s)]
*  That's right. And he goes specifically to talking about the agriculture community. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=733.12s)]
*  Our new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=737.84s)]
*  He describes himself as loving America's farmers. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  Who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=747.12s)]
*  with you. But that group of people are really concerned about the tariffs that are coming. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=754.32s)]
*  And Trump does acknowledge that there might be, quote, a little bit of an adjustment period. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  It may be a little bit of an adjustment period. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=765.44s)]
*  As these tariffs go into place. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=768.0s)]
*  He's acknowledging these tariffs are going to hurt American farmers. That's not his normal [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  mode to admit that tariffs might make someone miserable. But he's doing so because he knows [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=778.48s)]
*  this group of Americans voted for him in large numbers. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes. And he, Michael, I think truly believes that it will be short term. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  Our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers have a lot of fun. I love [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=793.6s)]
*  you too. He is a huge believer in tariffs. He doesn't just see it as a tool. He sees it as a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=800.48s)]
*  money making device for the country. And he believes, correctly or not, that the markets [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=805.44s)]
*  will correct and that things will ultimately be okay. But if we truly care about protecting [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=811.28s)]
*  Americans children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=816.48s)]
*  And from there, he goes on to the other major item in this new government that he's creating. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=822.7199999999999s)]
*  And that is border security and cracking down on undocumented immigrants. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=829.12s)]
*  Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=833.92s)]
*  He talks specifically about. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=840.4s)]
*  We quickly achieve the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=842.88s)]
*  Border crossings. He says it's now the lowest in US history. It's not clear that that's true, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=850.08s)]
*  but it certainly is the lowest in about 25 years. Right. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  And he's clearly very proud of that and goes from that really to blaming Biden and Democrats [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=859.44s)]
*  for the situation that he says he inherited. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=866.48s)]
*  Because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=869.2s)]
*  they are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  And he talks about how Biden and Democratic lawmakers had talked about a new border bill. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=881.76s)]
*  And that is true. They did talk about it and they didn't get one done. And he says that it turns out. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=888.0s)]
*  The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=892.16s)]
*  We must have legislation to secure the border. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=897.92s)]
*  But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=901.04s)]
*  New legislation wasn't needed. We just needed a new president. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=907.12s)]
*  Right. He's saying I am the reason border crossings went down. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=916.4799999999999s)]
*  We didn't need anything to go through Congress. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=920.88s)]
*  And the reason that felt significant is that one of the questions, I think, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=924.64s)]
*  I'm going to suspect you agree, that hovered over this speech before it even started was [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=930.4s)]
*  how this group of lawmakers was going to relate to a president who since taking office has [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  consistently circumvented them. Right. He has been shutting down agencies that Congress funds. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=940.0s)]
*  He's been freezing federal spending that Congress has appropriated. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=946.16s)]
*  And what struck me about this particular moment is you have the president saying to members of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=951.04s)]
*  Congress, I didn't even need you or want you to get anything done on the border. I did it on my own. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=955.6s)]
*  And they're cheering. So in a sense, they're cheering their own powerlessness. And that was striking. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=961.52s)]
*  That's true. And Trump has done so much by executive action. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=969.36s)]
*  And that has meant just doing and runs around Congress, including taking actions that [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=974.0s)]
*  he is required legally to notify Congress about. And he's not doing it. And instead of objecting, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  you are just seeing these House members cheering him on. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=985.4399999999999s)]
*  We really don't get these living, breathing moments where you're not just reminded that [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=992.8s)]
*  the members of the House and Senate in the Republican Party are neutered, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1002.56s)]
*  but they are endorsing the fact that they are neutered. Right. And are basically bowing to Trump. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1007.44s)]
*  Even as he takes away their power. Even as he takes away their power. Correct. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1014.32s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1027.68s)]
*  Mike, eventually Trump turns from talking about domestic accomplishments to his vision for foreign [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1037.36s)]
*  policy, which is, as we've talked about with you on the show in the past, this unusual combination [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1047.52s)]
*  of America first and America the imperialist. Correct. To further enhance our national security, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal. And we've already started. He talked again [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1062.8s)]
*  about how he wants to take over the Panama Canal. And I also have a message tonight for the incredible [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1069.4399999999998s)]
*  people of Greenland. And then he turned to Greenland, which he has been talking about wanting to acquire [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1075.4399999999998s)]
*  in some fashion for a while. We strongly support your right to determine your own future. And when [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1082.72s)]
*  he first started talking about Greenland, he actually sounded less bellicose and firm than [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1090.32s)]
*  he has in the past. And if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. We need [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1099.12s)]
*  Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're. He talked [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1104.8s)]
*  about wanting them to join the U.S. as if it was a choice, whereas in the past it's generally been, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1110.48s)]
*  I'm going to get you. Right. Perhaps even by military force. Right. But then he got to that [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1115.6799999999998s)]
*  point eventually anyway in the speech. And after going from sort of an invitation, it went to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1120.8s)]
*  something much more declarative. And I think we're going to get it one way or the other. We're going [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1127.6s)]
*  to get it. And from there, he pivots to what was essentially the biggest subject of the past week [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1133.36s)]
*  as it relates to him, which is Russia and Ukraine. That's right. And I'm also working [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1143.36s)]
*  tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. He starts out by saying he's working tirelessly [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1149.52s)]
*  to end this fight. And he looks over at the Democrats sitting in their section in the [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  House chamber. He clearly believed that he was going to get some cheers for saying that he wanted [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1162.32s)]
*  to end the war. Did not. Did not. And then eyeballs the Democrats. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1166.16s)]
*  Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah. Yeah. You would say Pocahontas says [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1174.5600000000002s)]
*  yes. And then singles out Elizabeth Warren, who he consistently mocks as Pocahontas because she [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1180.48s)]
*  previously had claimed that she had Native American heritage. And he goes from that, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1191.28s)]
*  sort of making fun of the Democrats to being fairly conciliatory about President Zelensky [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1196.8799999999999s)]
*  of Ukraine. Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1204.56s)]
*  He says he got a letter from Zelensky. I'm not actually clear that he got a letter or that he [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1211.2s)]
*  got a tweet, but either way, he's reading from a piece of paper. And nobody wants peace more than [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1217.04s)]
*  the Ukrainians, he said. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1223.44s)]
*  to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1230.96s)]
*  maintain its sovereignty and independence. It says that Ukraine is ready to come to the [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1238.3999999999999s)]
*  negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. And it's notable because [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1243.76s)]
*  Trump had this extraordinary, unprecedented- Blowout. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1250.64s)]
*  Beatdown of Zelensky by Trump and JD Vance in the Oval Office on Friday, and then halting the aid [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1256.48s)]
*  on Monday- Right, to Ukraine from the US. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1265.6s)]
*  Correct. And then getting a little bit of a concession from Zelensky on Tuesday. And that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1268.32s)]
*  seemed to be enough for Trump to say, okay, we can go back to the table. And Trump clearly wants people [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1275.9199999999998s)]
*  to believe that when he makes a threat, he means it. So he turned off the aid and the point seems [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1284.96s)]
*  to have been received by Zelensky and we'll see where it goes. So what Trump does in this section [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1290.96s)]
*  of the speech you're saying is he's saying to both Zelensky and the world, see my stick-based [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1295.84s)]
*  approach, my hammer Zelensky approach worked. And so now I will resume negotiations with him. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1303.1999999999998s)]
*  Correct. And he's doing it in a way where he can show that he is starting again, but that it was [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1312.56s)]
*  Zelensky who bowed. And that is always very important to Trump. Okay. So talk about how the [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1319.28s)]
*  speech eventually comes to an end. So toward the end- A history teacher named Mark Fogel [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1326.56s)]
*  was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony. Rough stuff. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1335.12s)]
*  Trump starts talking about Mark Fogel, who was a Pennsylvania school teacher who had been imprisoned [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1342.16s)]
*  in Russia for a few years. But last summer I promised his 95 year old mother, Malfeen, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1347.52s)]
*  that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1354.56s)]
*  And they are here tonight. Trump's advisors helped secure his release. But Trump makes this pretty [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1362.72s)]
*  abrupt transition from talking about Mark Fogel- As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1372.72s)]
*  in a small rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1379.3600000000001s)]
*  To talking about himself. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1384.64s)]
*  Because he describes how he was talking to Fogel's mother at his rally, Trump's rally, in July of 2024 [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1390.3200000000002s)]
*  in Butler, Pennsylvania. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1398.48s)]
*  stage. And the moments after they were talking- Gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1405.68s)]
*  unloaded eight bullets- Trump faced the bullet of a would-be assassin. Right. I was saved by God to [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  make America great again. I believe that. And Trump proceeds to describe himself as saved by [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1420.72s)]
*  God. And this is a statement he made at various points during the campaign. But it reflects a [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1428.88s)]
*  belief that both he and his advisors have, which is that there is something divine about his victory. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1435.28s)]
*  There's something divine about the fact that he was saved and that he is being swept back into office [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1443.44s)]
*  to save the country. Which is a very different thing to say as a candidate than to say in a joint [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1449.12s)]
*  address to Congress. Because suddenly you have the president saying, I believe I was put here by God [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1456.0s)]
*  to save the country before members of Congress. Correct. And you have a sitting president saying, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  essentially everything that he said on the campaign trail, repeatedly, despite having won. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1471.12s)]
*  My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future because the golden age of America has only [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1478.32s)]
*  just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you. And God [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  bless America. So Maggie, when this speech was over, I'm curious what you were thinking. This is [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  not your first Trump joint address to Congress. It's probably your fifth? Yes. And certainly the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1500.1599999999999s)]
*  longest. So after I was thinking about how long it was, it was the longest. I was thinking about [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1507.2s)]
*  how struck I was at how little forward looking there was in this speech. There were a few things, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1513.3600000000001s)]
*  but mostly it was a celebration of Trump and it was a celebration of his last 40 some odd days in [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1520.64s)]
*  office. And it was a celebration of all the things that he campaigned on in 2024. But what that [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1526.24s)]
*  translates to for the rest of a presidency, let alone the rest of this year, was not answered in [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1532.56s)]
*  this speech. Well, Maggie, thank you very much. Michael, thank you. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1538.8799999999999s)]
*  On Tuesday night, in the Democratic response to Trump's speech, Senator Alyssa Slotkin of Michigan [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1562.56s)]
*  directly addressed demoralized members of her party. Don't tune out. It's easy to be exhausted, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1574.1599999999999s)]
*  but America needs you now more than ever. And suggested that under Trump, democracy itself [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1581.6799999999998s)]
*  is now at risk. I've seen democracies flicker out. I've seen what life is like when a government [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1588.96s)]
*  is rigged. You can't open a business without paying off a corrupt official. You can't criticize the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1594.72s)]
*  guys in charge without getting a knock at the door in the middle of the night. So as much as we need [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1600.08s)]
*  to make our government more responsive to our lives today, don't for one moment fool yourself [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1605.68s)]
*  that democracy isn't precious and worth saving. We'll be right back. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1611.12s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. The Times reports that as part of President Trump's [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1633.6799999999998s)]
*  sweeping campaign of cost cutting, the Internal Revenue Service is preparing to eliminate as much [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1639.84s)]
*  as 50 percent of its staff. Experts say that such a major reduction in staffing could jeopardize [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1646.56s)]
*  the ability of the IRS to complete its basic mission of collecting taxes. And a Supreme Court [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1654.24s)]
*  ruling on Tuesday further restricted the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1663.4399999999998s)]
*  pollution. The question before the court in the case was whether under the Clean Water Act, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1669.52s)]
*  the EPA could penalize the city of San Francisco for violating policies on the release of wastewater [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1675.92s)]
*  into the Pacific Ocean. City officials argued that the EPA rules were so vague that it was impossible [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1683.44s)]
*  to know when the city had violated them. A claim that the Supreme Court justices endorsed as they [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1691.44s)]
*  struck down the EPA's rules. Today's episode was produced by Mujzadi, Asa Chathurvedi, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1698.48s)]
*  Michael Simon Johnson, and Eric Krupke. It was edited by Rachel Cuester, contains original music [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhobPDrlTxU&t=1710.56s)]
