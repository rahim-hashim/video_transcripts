# Israel and Hamasâ€™s Fragile Cease-Fire
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNyyMarY-k8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Taverdisi, and this is The Daily.
*  The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, now in its fifth day, has been historic in
*  scope and success.
*  At its heart are hostages.
*  As of Monday night, 50 Israeli hostages have been released under its terms, as have 150
*  Palestinian prisoners, with more releases expected on Tuesday.
*  Today, my colleague Isabel Kirschner, on the grassroots movement that managed to pause
*  the war, and what it will mean for the rest of the conflict.
*  It's Tuesday, November 28th.
*  So Isabel, it's Monday around 9 p.m. for you.
*  You've had a busy few days in Israel, and that is precisely why we want to talk to you today.
*  So for the first time since October 7th, we have had, for the most part, a halt in hostilities.
*  No airstrikes in Gaza, no rockets into Israel, and there's been this remarkable release
*  of Israeli hostages, and of course, of Palestinian prisoners.
*  So tell us what's been happening.
*  Well, since October 7th, this country has been at war, and then suddenly, on Friday
*  morning at 7 a.m., the guns went silent.
*  And this was a result of a deal that had been reached between Israel and Hamas, with mediation
*  from outside.
*  And the outlines of that deal was that Israel would cease fire for four days.
*  During that time, Israel would allow an increased amount of aid and fuel to go into the Gaza
*  Strip, and at the same time, Hamas had committed to release 50 of the Israeli hostages being
*  held in Gaza in exchange for an Israeli release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees from
*  Israeli jails.
*  And traditionally, when you look back to former conflicts between Israel and the armed groups
*  in Gaza, there have been ceasefires before, and they would break down often within hours.
*  This time, remarkably, the ceasefire has held, and that's because at the heart of it is
*  this issue of the release of hostages.
*  So what is it about the hostages that makes this so historic?
*  Bring me into that deal.
*  Well, first of all, for Israel, this was an unprecedented event to have 240 people taken
*  captive into Gaza.
*  At first, the initial impulse was to fight back, to retaliate, and the Israeli government
*  and military immediately set the war goal as being eradicating Hamas' rule and destroying
*  its military capabilities.
*  That was the focus from October the 7th.
*  And to a large extent, it felt like the hostage issue in all the shock and the fog of war
*  was almost taking a secondary role, like a backseat.
*  But the families of the hostages, they, of course, had their own number one priority,
*  which was to bring their loved ones back home.
*  We saw the beginnings within a week of a grassroots domestic movement led by the families of hostages
*  and one father in particular who stands out, Avichai Brodach, as someone who really kicked
*  this off.
*  So, Isabel, tell me about Mr. Brodach and this grassroots movement that he helped start.
*  So, Avichai Brodach, he's a farmer and a student of nursing from a kibbutz, a communal village
*  near the Gaza border called Kfar Aza.
*  On the morning of October the 7th, he saw that the neighbor's child, a three-year-old,
*  Avigal Edan, was running around on the lawn covered in blood after her father had been
*  shot dead.
*  He ran out and brought her into their home and handed her to his wife and he then went
*  out to get a weapon and start to defend the kibbutz.
*  When he came back home, he found that his family, along with the neighbor's child,
*  Avigal, had all gone and he didn't know what had happened.
*  It transpired after a couple of days that they were indeed confirmed as having been
*  kidnapped to Gaza.
*  Wow, so his whole family had been kidnapped, including the little girl that he saved.
*  That's right, his wife Hagar and their three children are Fri, Yuval, and Uriah, who are
*  aged 10, 8 and 4, and the neighbor's little daughter, Avigal Edan.
*  Okay, so what does he do?
*  So he was feeling that the hostages were not first and foremost in the government's mind,
*  that the country was very focused on the fighting in Gaza and revenge, and he was frustrated.
*  A week after his family was taken, he just went himself overnight, took a plastic chair,
*  sat himself down with the family dog outside the military and government headquarters in
*  Tel Aviv with a cardboard sign that he'd written, which had a very simple message on
*  it, My family is in Gaza.
*  By the morning, hundreds of supporters who heard about him began to join him.
*  Bring them home!
*  And I think that was really the beginning of the grassroots campaign that we saw grow
*  into a huge force in the country.
*  I demand from the right-wing Yahu to give us an answer!
*  Posters of the kidnapped people began appearing all over the country.
*  There's a square in Tel Aviv in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Opera, and
*  that became the hub of activity of the hostages' families.
*  So you began to see installations there, like the long table set for a Sabbath meal with
*  240 empty chairs.
*  And then we saw the families forming delegations to travel abroad and meet with world leaders.
*  Where is the world?
*  Why is no one crying out for these people to be allowed access to the Red Cross?
*  Why is no one demanding just proof of life?
*  My family, my babies, my wife, they need to get out now.
*  You need to use all your power in order to do so.
*  You can speak in front of the European Parliament and go to Geneva and meet with the International
*  Committee of the Red Cross.
*  Another relative of a family that had been taken to Gaza, Yuval Haran, he spearheaded
*  what became a long march which set out from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
*  Bring them home now!
*  Red Coulomb, watch out!
*  Government, do your job!
*  And by the time they marched into Jerusalem and to the Prime Minister's offices, there
*  were thousands of people filling the streets.
*  So really kind of a little movement that grows into this moral drumbeat for the country
*  and one that was really impossible to ignore.
*  Absolutely.
*  And I think they captured the hearts of many, many, many Israelis.
*  I mean, we saw a shift.
*  We saw the hostage issue moving from being what at first felt like a secondary issue
*  to the front stage where the government and the military were then describing it as a
*  dual goal that this campaign was equally about getting Hamas out of power and bringing the
*  hostages home.
*  Okay, so that's the domestic pressure on Netanyahu to do something about the hostages.
*  But of course, that's just one side of the equation here, right?
*  The other side is, of course, the ceasefire.
*  So what was the talk domestically about engaging in a ceasefire?
*  What were Israelis saying?
*  Well, there hadn't been much talk actually about a ceasefire.
*  The majority of Israelis were very unified about the need for this war to be fought,
*  that this Hamas assault could not go unanswered.
*  There was only small, small pockets of people calling for a ceasefire.
*  A ceasefire does come with risks for the military and the government because any pause in the
*  fighting, you're giving time to Hamas to regroup kind of a breather for the other side.
*  So there was some debate about whether the ceasefire was a good idea or not.
*  But I think by then, the public pressure to do anything possible to bring at least some
*  of the hostages back alive was the main goal.
*  There was, of course, another big force at play, which was the United States.
*  We know from our colleagues in Washington that there was significant pressure being
*  put on Israel by the Biden administration on the question of civilian deaths and the
*  humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza.
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken in early November said, quote, there is more that can
*  and should be done to minimize harm to Palestinian civilians.
*  So I guess I'm wondering, what role did the US play here exactly in terms of negotiating
*  an actual ceasefire between Israel and Hamas?
*  I think it played a critical role.
*  The Biden administration had every interest in some kind of pause.
*  Washington wanted increased aid and fuel to go into Gaza to try and mitigate and ease
*  the humanitarian crisis there.
*  And yes, was becoming increasingly uncomfortable about the spiraling death toll of Palestinians
*  in Gaza, particularly the huge civilian death toll there of women and children.
*  And at the same time, the administration also had another interest in getting hostages out
*  because there are nearly a dozen hostages who are dual US Israeli citizens.
*  And so there were various interests at play here.
*  And one Israeli former Mossad official who had been responsible in the past for negotiating
*  the return of Israeli MIAs and hostages and is now, in his words, working behind the scenes.
*  He told me that once he saw the involvement of the Americans in reaching this deal, that's
*  when he knew it was serious.
*  Interesting. I mean, there is not to be too political and cynical in terms of the Americans,
*  but of course, the question of domestic politics in the US for Biden.
*  You know, parts of the Democratic Party are calling for a ceasefire.
*  Some members of Congress, too, were headed into an election season.
*  You know, these are important indicators that I have to imagine the Israelis have been
*  keenly aware of, you know, that the US may not have endless patience for Israel's war.
*  Of course, and Israel can only continue to act at the pace it was acting as long as it has some
*  international legitimacy left for its campaign.
*  And it was clear that that was beginning to weft in.
*  So what we saw was the Qataris and the Egyptians acting as mediators between Israel and Hamas
*  and the Americans in the background as a very, very strong pressure force to have this deal
*  move ahead. And all of this culminated at 7am on Friday morning when the ceasefire came into effect.
*  And then by the evening, you saw the whole country here gripped by these scenes being aired and
*  broadcast on TV of the first group of these hostages being handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza
*  and eventually making their way back into Israel.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Isabel, we left off in this very dramatic moment.
*  A ceasefire finally begins on Friday morning and hostages and prisoners are about to be released.
*  So what happens?
*  Well, the terms of the deal, as they were announced, was that Israel would get 50 hostages back.
*  The priority or the criteria would be that women and children would be released from captivity.
*  And there was also a principle that children who'd been kidnapped with mothers would come out
*  together with their mothers.
*  And on the side of Hamas, the demand was for three prisoners or detainees to be released from
*  Israeli custody in return for each hostage.
*  So that would be 150 prisoners and detainees.
*  And again, the criteria would be women and minors, teenagers who had been in Israeli detention.
*  And Isabel, were these people who had actually committed crimes on the Palestinian side?
*  Well, they were all accused of, some had been convicted of.
*  You know, many were teenagers who were detained for throwing stones or people who'd been
*  detained or tried for association with armed groups.
*  Many had not been charged or tried or convicted, but they all were accused of something.
*  And why are there three times as many Palestinians being released?
*  Like, how did that math work?
*  We've seen in the past very lopsided prisoner exchanges between Israel and Hamas and other
*  Palestinian groups.
*  So, for example, when Hamas captured an Israeli soldier in 2006, Gilad Shalit, and took him
*  into Gaza and kept him captive there for five years.
*  In the end, Israel got him back in exchange for more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners,
*  half of whom had been convicted of deadly terror acts.
*  So in a way, Israel is used to paying more than one for one.
*  And this is what the side settled for.
*  So tell us about the releases themselves.
*  How does a hostage physically get out of Gaza?
*  What we've been seeing since Friday is this nightly drama where a list is drawn up and
*  agreed upon by Israel and Hamas.
*  And the list is kept under wraps until it's confirmed that these people actually are being
*  freed.
*  And what happens is the Hamas armed men hand them over in southern Gaza.
*  You've got these armed fighters, masked, wearing fatigues, handing over these women and
*  children to Red Cross representatives.
*  The Israeli army released a video showing the moment a bus carrying hostages released by
*  Hamas crossed back into Israeli territory.
*  They put into Red Cross ambulances or vans and driven across the border into Israel from
*  Egypt, where they received initial checkups to see if anybody needed emergency care.
*  There were a couple of cases of hostages who were helicoptered actually straight to the
*  closest hospital to the Gaza Strip.
*  One had a leg injury and needed surgery.
*  And the other was an older woman, Elma Avraham, of 84 years old, who actually was in critical
*  condition because she had not been given her heart medication that she needs to to
*  survive.
*  Are there any other stories, Isabel, that stand out to you in terms of the hostages who
*  were released?
*  Well, absolutely.
*  There's the girl, Hila, and she's 11 or 12 years old, but she appeared without her mother.
*  And this was against the guidelines that had been agreed upon that mothers and children
*  should not be separated.
*  There's been speculation why her mother, Raya, did not come out of Gaza with her.
*  It was said at one point that Hamas didn't know where she was.
*  Hamas doesn't have all the hostages in its hands.
*  Other armed groups have some of them that they couldn't locate her.
*  But since she's been back in Israel, her relatives who've met with her have said that
*  actually she was being held with her mother.
*  And so, you know, we've not had any official explanation.
*  And we saw Avichai Brodach's family come back.
*  And the pictures just emerged today of his reunion with his wife and his children.
*  And his wife and children came back with Avigail Yidan, the neighbor's daughter.
*  The little girl.
*  The little girl who'd been alone, who'd lost both her parents on October the 7th and
*  had turned four in captivity on Friday.
*  So she has captured the hearts of many people here and she's been reunited here with
*  her grandmother and she has two older siblings who survived October the 7th.
*  And what have the reunions been like?
*  Well, very emotional from what we've seen.
*  You know, it's not just pure joy because many of these hostages who've been coming
*  back to Israel have either left people behind in Gaza.
*  So there are mothers with children who have left behind their husbands and the
*  children's father in Gaza.
*  There are elderly women who've left their husbands behind in Gaza and many who've
*  come out to find that some of their family members were killed on October the 7th.
*  And they didn't know that and only learned that as they got back here.
*  And what about the Palestinian prisoners being released?
*  How did those releases play out?
*  So my colleague, Christina Goldbaum, who's been covering the release of the Palestinian
*  prisoners and detainees has been describing very vividly the scenes every night in Ramallah,
*  where crowds have gathered outside the detention center where the prisoners and
*  detainees are released from.
*  And great joy on that side.
*  But again, mixed with a kind of sadness and concern because of the high death toll in Gaza.
*  Many of the detainees who've been coming out are young teens.
*  For example, Christina's written about Tariq Daoud, who's 17.
*  So he was accused of throwing stones at Israeli soldiers who were on a military raid in
*  his neighborhood, as well as possession of weapons or explosive devices.
*  But he wasn't tried yet and he'd been detained for a year.
*  So his father described to my colleagues how he was glued to his television screen for
*  days, waiting to see if his son Tariq would appear on one of the lists.
*  And finally, his name did come up on Saturday afternoon.
*  So his father drove to meet him in Ramallah and took him back to Kalkilia.
*  And by the time they got there, it was dawn and dozens of relatives and friends were
*  there to greet him.
*  And they ended up driving around the neighborhood in a 15 car motorcade.
*  Do we have a sense of how much longer this ceasefire is going to last?
*  Like, what's going to happen?
*  Well, the original deal was for four days, which would end today.
*  But Israel from the beginning had proposed that if Hamas could come up with another
*  10 hostages per day, Israel would be willing to extend the ceasefire or the pause by
*  another day. And that would be up to a total of 100 hostages.
*  So that would be another five days of 10 hostages per day.
*  And at first, we didn't hear anything.
*  They didn't publicly respond to that proposition.
*  But suddenly last night, the Hamas leadership announced that they were interested in
*  seeking an extension and very quickly by today, the sides have agreed to extend for
*  another two days at least and see another 20 hostages come back.
*  And that would mean another 60 Palestinian prisoners and detainees released.
*  And I think what we're going to see is Hamas trying to pull this string as long as it
*  can and, you know, try and keep the ceasefire going as long as it can.
*  Now we're already hearing the beginnings of reports that Hamas is now willing to begin
*  to negotiate the release of captive soldiers.
*  But it's difficult to see how, as long as Hamas is dangling this proposition of more
*  hostages coming out, it's difficult to see Netanyahu say, no, that's enough.
*  We're going back to the war.
*  So we'll have to see how it plays out.
*  I think from the perspective of many Israelis, there's an urgency to getting as many
*  hostages out and that the war can wait.
*  Isabel, stepping back here, it seems like we're at this point that in some ways,
*  Israel's government and military was worried about, you know, the point where the
*  ceasefire starts to feel kind of inevitable and longer lasting.
*  So what does this mean for Israel and its mission of eliminating Hamas?
*  Well, we saw Netanyahu yesterday actually visiting the troops in Gaza for the first
*  time, taking advantage of the pause.
*  And he pledged to the citizens of Israel and to the soldiers that we will be going
*  back to the war.
*  Israel would continue until victory, and that meant eliminating Hamas ruling Gaza.
*  Now, what that means, people are still not sure or clear about.
*  How do you wipe out Hamas?
*  Are you going to get rid of every single last Hamas fighter with a Kalachnikov?
*  It's a goal that many people see as a little ambiguous and fuzzy anyway.
*  Nobody's sure how this is going to end and what comes next.
*  But for the time being, the government and the military are saying that they are
*  absolutely determined at the end of this ceasefire to pick up where they left off.
*  Isabel, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  Late on Monday, Israel's Army radio, citing the prime minister's office, reported that
*  the government had received a list of hostages held by Hamas who are expected to be
*  released on Tuesday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, a 48-year-old man was charged with three counts of attempted murder in the
*  weekend shooting in Burlington, Vermont, of three young men of Palestinian descent.
*  The men, college students and friends since childhood, had been staying at the home of an
*  uncle and had gone out for a walk on Saturday night when the suspect, identified by
*  police as Jason Eaton, approached them, pulled out a handgun and started shooting,
*  striking them in the spine, the chest and the back.
*  Local officials called the shooting one of the most shocking events in Burlington's
*  history. Relatives of the men, two of whom were wearing Palestinian kafias, a traditional
*  headdress at the time of the shooting, said they feared that the men had been targeted for
*  being Arab-American.
