# The Year of Taylor Swift
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYtxBRSoJbM)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  2023 was many different things to many different people. For our guest, Times Magazine writer
*  Taffy Brodesser-Akner, it was the year of Taylor Swift.
*  This Friday, December 15th.
*  So I have to say this is the episode I've been looking forward to the most of the whole
*  year.
*  What?
*  Which probably says something about the gestation of a daily episode that it's taken us this
*  long to make.
*  And the news this year.
*  And the news this year.
*  to you Taffy about Taylor Swift for months and months and months.
*  And I think it's appropriate that this ends up being one of the last episodes we do in
*  2023.
*  I am so happy to be here talking to you about it.
*  Yeah.
*  And here, just going to get this out of the way.
*  Not objective about Taylor Swift.
*  Neither am I.
*  I'm a fan.
*  I'm a Swiftie.
*  We have to disclose these things.
*  We have to.
*  It's part of the rules.
*  Yeah.
*  The ethics guidelines.
*  I don't pretend to be open minded.
*  I'm bought in.
*  And within the context of, I suppose, fandom, we're going to apply a critical lens.
*  Yes, of course.
*  That's what we do.
*  That's what we do.
*  We're going to be journalists.
*  Sure.
*  So I want to understand, in your mind, why Taylor is not someone to just be a fan of,
*  to become entranced by during a commute, workout, cleaning session, and here I'm being my graphical,
*  but somebody worthy of a journalistic inquiry of the kind that you carried out a little
*  bit earlier this year.
*  My pitch for the story was that we are neglecting our audience if we don't cover this thing
*  that is so big that clearly became what is obviously the cultural event of my lifetime.
*  I remember the way my parents used to talk about Woodstock, which they didn't go to,
*  but they talked about it.
*  And I knew about it.
*  And as the summer went on, it was all around me in a way that I don't think anything has
*  ever been all around me.
*  And I began to see first that it was going to be Woodstock, and then it was going to
*  be bigger than Woodstock.
*  Then it was going to be something like everything else about her that we don't have words to
*  compare to.
*  And that is what Taylor Swift is.
*  Okay, let's put some numbers and some context around this very big year.
*  Just give us the cliff notes of what makes this the year of Taylor Swift.
*  So good morning, America.
*  It's Taylor.
*  I wanted to tell you something that I've been so excited about for a really long time.
*  Taylor Swift announces her new tour.
*  The tour is called the Eras Tour, and it's a journey through all of my musical eras of
*  my career.
*  People try to get tickets.
*  They can't get tickets.
*  I started to get tickets to the Taylor Swift concert.
*  I know every single album.
*  I know every song.
*  I can sing you every song.
*  They're paying thousands and thousands of dollars.
*  You're hearing about $18,000 tickets.
*  And then the tour starts.
*  The tour starts in Arizona.
*  And at first, it's just a concert.
*  And then suddenly, I don't want to say out of nowhere, because it's not out of nowhere.
*  She is everywhere.
*  The only thing that exists in any of my feeds, even in certain parts of the newspaper, on
*  television, in conversation, is Taylor Swift.
*  And the tour itself becomes a phenomenon.
*  It becomes its own news cycle.
*  Taylor Swift fans may have taken her hit song, Shake It Off, too literally.
*  And she sings Shake It Off.
*  All the shaking is with Seattle's show this past weekend.
*  It actually caused the equivalent of a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.
*  That's a new record.
*  There is an earthquake in Seattle that registers on seismographs near the stadium.
*  Right.
*  The U.S. tour could generate $4.6 billion in consumer spending.
*  That boost that has leaders worldwide requesting their own eras tour dates.
*  World leaders are asking her to come and bring her tour to give their economy a boost.
*  At some point, it made a billion dollars.
*  The most we believe of any musician ever.
*  We don't know when this tour is going to end.
*  Michael, we don't know if this tour is going to end.
*  And then she announces.
*  Taylor Swift just announced her eras tour is headed to the big screen.
*  Oh.
*  That she's going to release a movie of the concert while she's on tour.
*  And she releases this movie.
*  It is a bananas hit.
*  Right.
*  I saw it on opening day.
*  I mean, I had a Taylor Swift birthday party.
*  I turned 48.
*  I invited 35 people.
*  And on the day I published the story, we published seven other stories about Taylor Swift because
*  that's what we do now.
*  We are the Taylor Swift time.
*  Are you ready for it?
*  We're ready for it.
*  The 2023 Time Person of the Year is Taylor Swift.
*  And then she was named recently Time's Person of the Year.
*  Right.
*  But we picked a choice, someone who represents joy, someone who's taken her own story and
*  made it big enough for everyone.
*  And like everything else about her when I saw it was her, I saw, of course it was.
*  Who else would it have been?
*  So that brings me to why we are here, you and I.
*  Sure.
*  Not simply to marvel and revel in the bigness of Taylor Swift over the past year, but to
*  really get at the heart of it, to decode it, to make sense of it.
*  And you took on the Taylor Swift phenomenon in a pretty major way this past year for a
*  cover story of the New York Times Magazine.
*  So what did you think had been kind of left unsaid and ultimately where did you land?
*  The thing I wasn't seeing was the thing I came to understand as I was watching the concert
*  play out on social media.
*  I had not yet read the definitive account of why she matters on this level, why these
*  numbers, why everyone of every age, why when you see a grown woman there with a teenage
*  child, you don't know if the teenage child is drinking the grown woman or vice versa.
*  She has these songs that sound like amazing pop songs.
*  She is a songwriting savant.
*  But at some point, if you surround yourself with the music enough, you start to understand
*  what she is doing, which is she is telling the story of girlhood into womanhood.
*  In her songs, I see it.
*  I see her in real time cataloging the experiences of what it means to grow up.
*  It's not always apparent from first listen, second listen, tenth listen, because a lot
*  of her songs, to the untrained eye, kind of all seem like a love song.
*  Like love songs.
*  They're only love songs, if you're not careful.
*  Yes, they seem like only love songs.
*  What a great trick that you could write about business betrayal and friendship betrayal
*  in a love song.
*  But then when you land on what is unique about a woman, a girl, a female experience, it's
*  that we tend to, and I know I am speaking in a highly subjective way, we tend to take
*  all of that to heart in the same way.
*  Times that I've been betrayed in business hurt as much as the times I've been cheated
*  on by boyfriends.
*  It all lives in the same place.
*  And finally, I don't know why it took so long for somebody to understand that we needed
*  songs about these things.
*  These are the full range of a woman's experience, of any person's experience.
*  And she channeled it.
*  Okay, so let's, using that framework, approach Taylor Swift and her meaning to you, me, and
*  everybody else through these songs.
*  Let's decode so that we can better understand what you're really talking about here.
*  Where do you think we should start?
*  Let's start at the beginning.
*  And I'll tell you that she was this very young, ambitious child.
*  She wanted to be a singer.
*  She lived in Pennsylvania, and soon they moved to Nashville.
*  And one day, she sang the national anthem at a basketball game in Pennsylvania.
*  And she was so proud of that.
*  And she went home and she called up her friends and she asked them, do you want to go to the
*  mall with me tomorrow?
*  And they said, no, we're busy.
*  Each of them, they were all busy.
*  And her mother said, I'll take you to the mall.
*  Her beloved mother, Andrea, took her to the mall.
*  And guess who was there, Michael?
*  You know who was there.
*  All those friends, and they were together.
*  And she...
*  The cruelest imaginable cut to a young person.
*  This was a wound.
*  She just started bleeding there in the mall.
*  Her mother turns her around and said, we're going to a better mall.
*  They go to the King of Prussia mall.
*  And she writes about that incident in a song called The Best Day.
*  The song is about what happened, but it lives in the space of not the mall and not the other
*  mall, but the car ride where she's sitting next to her mother and having the sort of
*  experiences you could only really have next to your mother.
*  She has all of these horrible emotions about what just happened.
*  But by the time she's writing it, she also has this gratitude, so much so that she will
*  call this, eventually call the song, The Best Day.
*  I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school, but I know I'm laughing on the
*  car ride home with you.
*  Pop songs always exist in this glamorous space where the subject of the song has to somehow
*  boost the performer's image as well.
*  And this is not...
*  Yeah, this is not self-aggrandizing.
*  This is the opposite of self-aggrandizing.
*  What is...
*  De-aggrandizing.
*  The antonym for self-aggrandizing is going to the mall with your mom.
*  That's the phrase.
*  And window shopping afterwards so much that you can finally forget the names of the friends
*  who were so cruel to you.
*  Right.
*  Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay, but I know I had the best day with
*  you today.
*  So from early on, from the very beginning, what Taylor Swift is up to is processing the
*  very personal pain of girlhood through her music.
*  It's very biographical.
*  And what you're saying is really distinct about it is that it makes no attempt to glamorize
*  or pretend that these were wonderful times.
*  It's a real admission of just kind of the awfulness of being alive.
*  And it's not taking anybody's word for what a song should be about.
*  It is saying, this is my unique experience.
*  I wonder if anyone else has had this experience.
*  And it turns out everyone has.
*  Everyone has gone to the mall and seen their friends hanging out.
*  In America, everyone has gone to the mall and seen their friends hanging out without
*  them.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I still have those feelings.
*  Instagram.
*  Jesus, why wasn't I invited to that party?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So what is the next song that we should decode?
*  And here, I guess, just to stipulate for the listener, we are not going to be going through
*  the entire Taylor Swift catalog here.
*  We're a half hour show.
*  So we're just going to be talking about a few of these songs to explain your thesis.
*  So which one should we talk about next?
*  Okay.
*  So let's talk about All Too Well.
*  I see from the haunted look in your eyes that you too love All Too Well.
*  She released a 10-minute version years after this was already a sort of secret fave of
*  peoples.
*  And then it became sort of everyone's favorite.
*  So All Too Well was a song that came out on Red.
*  We're talking about a few meaningful years after.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Best day.
*  Yes.
*  Came out on Red.
*  She's already a pop star.
*  She's dating famous people.
*  This song is allegedly about Jake Gyllenhaal, her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal.
*  And All Too Well is a journey of someone who is saying the most intimate, explosive things
*  about a relationship after she sort of comes to.
*  She was in love and for every bit that she was in love, she is now aware of how she was
*  manipulated, how this was never going to work.
*  Well, talk about the lyrics because I think it's an incredibly exhaustive, encyclopedic
*  kind of after study of a failed relationship.
*  Right.
*  And something about her as a songwriter, she loves to upend a cliché.
*  Her understanding of cliché and language and metaphor.
*  Listen to this.
*  You call me up again just to break me like a promise.
*  And then she says something that is so withering, so casually cruel in the name of being honest.
*  It is like there is nobody who has ever been in a relationship who does not remember the
*  time somebody said something honest to them that was actually cruel and how you hate yourself
*  for appreciating the honesty first before you understand how completely awful it was.
*  Those lyrics are so staggering to me in a way that when someone else is writing your
*  songs for you, it never quite goes there.
*  Because what leaves when someone else is writing music for you, what leaves when you're trying
*  to figure out how to make a hit is specificity.
*  Specificity is out the window because you want every song to be a number one.
*  You want everyone to understand it.
*  And what she understands is that actually it's specificity that we've been missing from
*  our songs.
*  Right.
*  That specificity is what gives us the complexity, the nuance, and all the feeling that we get
*  from a Taylor Swift song.
*  It's a stunning song.
*  It's a stunning song and yet another song made very popular by her fans that's confessional
*  and about rejection.
*  Right.
*  She proceeds along this path and she becomes even more famous.
*  And usually, by the way, at this point, every pop singer becomes ridiculous because they're
*  too famous to be living regular lives anymore.
*  So they could only write about their fame.
*  Right, not their interior.
*  And not their interior.
*  Or also, new things aren't happening to them anymore.
*  They're just like...
*  Yeah, they're cosseted.
*  They're protected.
*  They're surrounded by people who just agree with them and they're just sort of statues
*  to what they used to be.
*  Not Taylor Swift because things keep happening to her.
*  So then the next thing that happens is the thing that everyone knows happens.
*  Yo, Taylor.
*  I'm really happy for you.
*  I'm gonna let you finish.
*  Which is Kanye storms the stage at the VMAs and starts talking about Beyonce in the middle
*  of Taylor Swift's acceptance speech for a VMA.
*  He's humiliated.
*  But a few years later, Taylor and Kanye seem to reconcile.
*  They are seen out to dinner together.
*  They take pictures together.
*  They're hugging at award shows.
*  Then things take a turn when Kanye says some terrible things about Taylor Swift in his
*  own song lyrics.
*  When Taylor objects, Kanye says he had her permission.
*  And then it gets even uglier when Kim Kardashian comes to her then-husband's defense and she
*  releases videotape proving, allegedly, that he had Taylor's permission.
*  The videotape is later revealed to be edited.
*  But in the meantime, Kim calls Taylor a snake and Kim Kardashian's many, many fans are unleashed
*  on Taylor.
*  And Taylor, a digital native who knows not to throw good money after bad, gets the hell
*  out.
*  She goes dark and she disappears.
*  And then a few months later, her social media comes back on with just the image of a snake.
*  Taylor announced her new album.
*  It's titled Reputation.
*  She broke the news on Instagram Wednesday with a series of images.
*  The snake becomes this image of what this album, Reputation, that she's about to release
*  is going to be.
*  A confession, a mourning, a self-own.
*  It is the rawest, most brutal album of self-loathing.
*  She lays it out to everybody.
*  And I cannot tell you what my favorite song on that album is because if you press play
*  on it, you'll just lose me.
*  But let's start with Look What You Made Me Do.
*  The song starts like this.
*  I don't like your little games.
*  Don't like your tilted stage.
*  Which is a reference to Kanye West.
*  Yes.
*  It's all a reference to Kanye West.
*  And then it's a reference to everyone else who came after her.
*  But then ultimately, it's a reference to herself and her own understanding of her role in how
*  this all happened.
*  She is talking about how she had this kingdom of fame, of approbation.
*  It was taken from her.
*  She befriended Kanye after the VMAs.
*  And then he did this to her.
*  And she felt so stupid and used.
*  And then started asking herself, why was I even willing to be friends with this person
*  who humiliated me?
*  What is the need that I have?
*  And this song is born from the self-loathing of realizing that you were willing to sit
*  with the people who hated you just to get them to stop hating you.
*  I don't know anyone who can't relate to that.
*  But then here are the other lyrics.
*  I got smarter.
*  I got harder in the nick of time.
*  Honey I rose up from the dead.
*  I do it all the time.
*  And there she is saying, this was going to kill me, but I was going to come back as whatever
*  it is I am now.
*  And that is as someone with regret, with anger, with passion.
*  I'm not a little girl anymore.
*  I'm not trying to please everyone anymore.
*  Never again will she roll over so that she will be loved.
*  Now she is going to do things on her terms because there are no rules anymore.
*  There's no one else who has been this famous.
*  There's no one else who has been this maligned and come back from it.
*  So now she's making her own rules.
*  And now, Michael, now we are in Taylor Swift's world.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Taffy, where we left off before the break was a defiant Taylor Swift taking yet another
*  painful moment of her life and using it to rebuild herself and to depart from one era
*  of life to another.
*  So what happens next for this reborn, tougher Taylor Swift?
*  So what happens next is that Taylor Swift, who now understands that there is no precedent
*  for her or for the career that she is going to have, something terrible happens to her.
*  Again.
*  Again.
*  Again, something terrible happens to her.
*  It's some music inside her baseball here.
*  Taylor Swift finds out that her masters were sold to someone she doesn't like without her
*  knowledge or permission.
*  Just explain that.
*  Okay.
*  So the masters are the original recordings of your songs.
*  And whoever owns your masters, which in a traditional recording contract is the record
*  company, that's the entity that profits off of your music.
*  You could become very rich performing.
*  But when we play music, the money generally goes to the owner of the masters.
*  So when we listen to Taylor Swift on Spotify, Apple Music, and someone makes money, it's
*  the person who owns the master.
*  Yes, for the most part.
*  And she claims that she woke up to learn the information that the masters had been sold.
*  She knew that the masters might be up for sale.
*  She says she asked for the opportunity to buy them back.
*  She says that she was not given the opportunity to buy them on her own.
*  And the worst part of all of this was that the person who sold it was someone she really
*  trusted.
*  And she couldn't bear it.
*  So she did what she always does when she is having a revelation, a deep moment, heavy
*  emotion.
*  She writes a song about it.
*  Well, she also winds up re-recording all of her songs one by one to retain the rights
*  and to profit from them.
*  Right.
*  Huge amount of work.
*  Which was genius.
*  But she also wrote a song about it.
*  The song is called My Tears Ricochet.
*  And again, she has not confirmed that this is what it's about.
*  But we all know that this is what it's about.
*  And I don't even know which lyrics to pick for you because this feels like a love song.
*  So you can read it.
*  This could be about your ex-boyfriend.
*  This could be about a guy you just broke up with.
*  Or, even more importantly, it could be about any time that someone who was in charge of
*  looking out for your best interests that you were working in good faith for pulled the
*  rug out from under you and betrayed you.
*  So here we go.
*  I didn't have it in myself to go with grace.
*  Because when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave.
*  So what she's saying here is that she couldn't just let this happen.
*  The way, by the way, everyone's masters get sent around and nobody ever involves the world
*  in the drama.
*  And she didn't have it in herself to just accede to it.
*  She just couldn't do it.
*  It's not in her.
*  And then in that next line, because when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave.
*  She grew up with the guy who sold the masters.
*  He was the one who was always telling her to be spunky and to fight for what she wanted.
*  And so he's partly to blame for the fact that she didn't have it in herself to go with grace.
*  And then there's this beautiful bridge.
*  I can go anywhere I want.
*  I can go anywhere I want.
*  Anywhere I want, just not home.
*  You could decide that home is her master.
*  But actually, I think home is this innocent place where she did not have to struggle.
*  She did not have to bring her entire fandom into this fight, which she did.
*  She can go anywhere she wants.
*  She's a global superstar.
*  But her home was the place where she knew she was being taken care of, where she felt
*  safe.
*  It's gone now.
*  And because in these relationships, they call you, they're in my family.
*  This guy's like a father to me.
*  And he just betrayed her.
*  And she didn't understand yet throughout all of this.
*  She had not yet understood that this business will always break your heart, that somebody
*  will always act in the interest of profits.
*  Then there is, so I'm going to just finish the bridge and then go into, I'm sorry, please
*  let me indulge.
*  This is a very personal song for me.
*  So I could go anywhere I want, just not home.
*  And I still talk to you when I'm screaming at the sky.
*  And when you can't sleep at night, you hear my stolen lullabies.
*  Of course, stolen is the word she uses to describe what happened when her masters were
*  sold.
*  It's such a terrific song that I'm embarrassed to say that I didn't listen to it much because
*  I thought the title was terrible.
*  I thought My Tears Ricochet is like the strangest, sopiest, most on-the-nose title.
*  Right tears don't ricochet.
*  What are you, a physicist?
*  I know, I know.
*  And I didn't pay it much attention until the week before the concert when I started just
*  making sure I was going in, as a New York Times reporter does, knowing everything I
*  need to know.
*  So this is a week before you somehow got tickets to go see Taylor.
*  I got tickets.
*  IRL.
*  IRL.
*  And I traveled to California.
*  This is a few months ago.
*  This is a few months ago.
*  This is in July.
*  I traveled to Santa Clara.
*  And on that night where I thought I was going to be sort of riveted by various aspects of
*  it, the religious experience I had at the concert was during My Tears Ricochet.
*  Hmm.
*  Religious how?
*  You know, I'm 48 years old and I've been working for a long time.
*  And over the course of my many years working, you know, I'm a competitive person.
*  I've found myself betrayed by people who loved me, appreciated me, and acted in their
*  business's best interests.
*  The job I had before this was at a magazine.
*  I learned that I wasn't just being underpaid at that job.
*  I was being paid roughly a third of what my male colleagues were being paid.
*  I was beloved by them, but also I loved them.
*  I loved them so much.
*  And when I hear the song, I cry.
*  And I cry here reiterating it because I can't believe that happened to me.
*  It was such a betrayal of me.
*  And it was such a betrayal of what I thought of myself.
*  That's the worst part of it is that if you'd asked me, will these people act in their best
*  interests, it was a magazine company.
*  Of course it would.
*  It was a publishing company.
*  Of course it would.
*  Did I think I was the kind of person that this could happen to?
*  I didn't.
*  And when I hear this song, I am right back there.
*  I am right back finding out in the most stunning way that I am being so comparatively underpaid.
*  And that's why it hurts to listen to this song.
*  And that's why it helps to listen to this song.
*  Because also there's this part of me that now that Taylor Swift feels that way, it allows
*  me off the hook a little bit.
*  If it could happen to Taylor Swift, why wouldn't it happen to me?
*  What you have clearly just demonstrated is that the Taylor Swift project of internalizing
*  pain and turning it into music has the effect that you're describing on tens of millions
*  of people.
*  It makes them see anew a lot of the pain in their lives, to look at it squarely in the
*  face and to try to better understand it and to have a catharsis around it.
*  Right.
*  Screaming, I can go anywhere I want, just not home.
*  Because what happens is you look back at all of your triumphs.
*  And now they're tinged.
*  Now there's an asterisk to them.
*  Look how underpaid you were.
*  Look how you were being taken like a sucker.
*  Look at your kids basketball games that you missed when you were on the story.
*  I was so lucky to have work.
*  That's what I tell myself.
*  I was so lucky to be building my career.
*  I was so lucky I was writing stories that got attention.
*  But then I'm in a stadium and it all comes over me and I am with 69,000 people that something
*  happened to.
*  And I once did a story on a megachurch and I suddenly understood what it meant to be
*  an evangelical Christian who was saved.
*  And she said, who would like to come up here and get saved?
*  I would have made my way up to the stage and let her put her palm on my forehead.
*  And I would have said, I am saved.
*  You're saying all around you are people, I'm assuming many of them are women and many of
*  them are boys, but they're all...
*  Some of them are boys.
*  A couple of them are boys.
*  They're all identifying with a moment where their triumph, their moment of joy is recognized
*  for its flaws, for its portrayals, for its undermining quality.
*  Yeah.
*  Everyone is singing that same lyric.
*  And it was something different for everybody.
*  In that moment, I knew what Taylor Swift has known all along, which is that this emotion
*  is universal.
*  The more detail you give, the more I will find myself in it.
*  The more you trust me as a listener and let me into your life, the more I will find myself
*  the way you have rendered a life.
*  And I will be so grateful for the rest of my life to have been able to sing that and
*  to be able to have some sort of catharsis around it.
*  Clearly, it wasn't enough because here I am crying on the daily.
*  All great art is the art that sees you.
*  And I know this from doing a million celebrity profiles.
*  And I know this from my understanding of fandom that if you show somebody that they are real,
*  you have them for life.
*  She has me for life.
*  And I'm not the only one.
*  Taffy, I really want to thank you.
*  This has been a wonderful conversation.
*  Michael, it's been so great to be here to talk about my favorite subject with my favorite podcast host.
*  Thank you.
*  Truly.
*  And happy holidays.
*  Happy holidays to you.
*  Do you think we should end with Michael and I singing all too well together?
*  Yes.
*  Is that yes?
*  That might be.
*  And I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes, I'll get older but your
*  lovers.
*  Wow.
*  Wow, Mike.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Times reports that the Biden administration has told the Israeli government that it must
*  wrap up its large-scale ground campaign in Gaza by the end of the year.
*  That message reflects the US's growing unease with the number of Palestinian civilians who
*  have been killed by Israel in response to Hamas' terror attacks on October 7.
*  The US is now asking Israel to transition to a new phase of the war that would involve
*  using smaller groups of Israeli commandos to carry out targeted missions such as killing
*  Hamas leaders and rescuing hostages.
*  And on Thursday, leaders of the European Union officially opened negotiations to allow Ukraine
*  to join the economic alliance.
*  The process of joining the EU could take years but would represent a triumph for Ukraine's
*  leaders as they try to deepen ties to the West and build financial support for their
*  war against Russia.
*  This episode was produced by Sydney Harper, Eric Krupke, and Summer Tamad.
*  It was edited by Michael Benoit, contains original music by Pat McCusker, Dan Powell,
*  Diane Wah, and Marian Lozano, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Runberg and Ben Lansferk of Wenderley.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Bobara.
*  See you on Monday.
