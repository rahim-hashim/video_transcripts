# Notre-Dame Rises From the Ashes
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX5pCuDMrGE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  On Sunday, after a fire that many feared would destroy it, and a swift renovation that defied
*  all predictions, the Cathedral of Notre Dame reopened to the public.
*  Today, Chief Architecture Critic Michael Kimmelman with the story of the miracle on the Seine.
*  It's Wednesday, December 11th.
*  Michael, welcome to The Daily.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Pleasure to be here.
*  I'm just going to acknowledge that we have been trying to get you on the show for seven
*  years, and then two days more, because over the past couple of days, there's been a tremendous
*  amount of very serious news.
*  The government in Syria fell a closely watched manhunt for the suspected murderer of the
*  CEO of a major healthcare company.
*  That case got cracked wide open, all of which delayed this much-awaited debut of yours on
*  the show.
*  Today is the day.
*  You, our Chief Architecture Critic, finally here talking about something worthy of your
*  biography, Notre Dame.
*  So welcome.
*  Better late than never, I hope.
*  Yes.
*  Just to begin, do you remember the first time you stepped inside that cathedral?
*  I mean, I remember as a boy going with my family, and we had come from the Soviet Union,
*  where I was unable to find milk.
*  I was probably eight.
*  Paris, it turns out, has milk.
*  It was cold, but I do remember going into the cathedral and feeling somehow warmed when
*  I went in there.
*  So that was my first impression.
*  I guess it stuck with me in some way.
*  So your memory of it is vague, but the impression I'm getting is that whenever it did to you,
*  it did something.
*  Yeah, I think it does to millions and millions of people who have no religious connection
*  to it.
*  It was a place that people imagined they had to go to if they went to Paris.
*  You didn't see Paris unless you went to Notre Dame.
*  So let's fast forward a good deal to several years ago.
*  Where were you when you first heard that Notre Dame was burning?
*  I remember very vividly where I was.
*  I was on my bike, rushing to an appointment on the west side of Manhattan.
*  My phone rang, and it was an editor here at the Times who sounded a little frantic and
*  told me I had to rush back and write something because Notre Dame was burning.
*  And I thought he was crazy.
*  Crazy why?
*  Because Notre Dame has a giant stone building.
*  I didn't think it could burn down, and it sounded sort of inconceivable.
*  It's like Everest.
*  It doesn't burn down.
*  So I...
*  The pyramids do not burn down.
*  There you go.
*  And I said, I'm sorry to tell you this, but his name is also Michael.
*  So I said, Michael, that doesn't make sense.
*  He said, I think you just better look on your phone.
*  And I went to find a live feed, and there it was.
*  I'm now turning to the back of the cathedral.
*  It is a terrible scene here.
*  The roof has entirely collapsed.
*  There are flames coming out of the back of the cathedral as if it was a torch.
*  It looks like the Olympic torch from the back.
*  I remember standing there on the corner, just frozen, staring at this sight, which seemed
*  inconceivable.
*  And then Twitter was just full of Pray for Paris hashtag, and everybody was suddenly
*  fixated.
*  Maybe it's a sign from God.
*  I don't know.
*  It's not normal.
*  It really was as if the world had stopped.
*  I see people crying.
*  I see a lot of emotions, and I'm shocked myself.
*  It's like your family loses somebody.
*  I told my sister and I said, you know, we are actually feeling physical pain watching
*  Notre Dame.
*  You feel like it's part of you.
*  And when you look at this 12th century medieval cathedral up in flames, it's like a knife.
*  It's very hard for me not to cry right now.
*  And I've been crying on and off the whole day.
*  It just has touched me and touched everyone in France, I think, very, very deeply.
*  It occurred to me at that moment, too, that's interesting.
*  I mean, why had the world stopped?
*  Why did this building mean so much to so many different people?
*  Not just people in France, but obviously all around the world.
*  So I rushed back to my computer.
*  I started making a few phone calls and trying to figure that out, trying to understand what
*  the building had meant over time.
*  And to see really what the building now represented to people, what this potential disaster, I
*  mean, it was certainly a disaster, but there was the fear, of course, that the building
*  would disappear, that this would be the moment after almost 900 years that we were living
*  at that moment when this building would go away.
*  Well, I'm curious, when this inquiry is moving along and you're making phone calls and you're
*  researching the history of Notre Dame and trying to understand why the feelings about
*  its burning are so widespread and so deep, what do you find?
*  Well, I think, Michael, you have to step back and say, what is the meaning of a building?
*  I mean, for me, architecture is really the world we built and are building.
*  I think a lot of people have talked about it as a kind of aesthetic thing, and that
*  is one aspect of it for sure.
*  I mean, I think the conversation around architecture for a while sort of saw it as a branch of
*  sculpture, you know, whether buildings were cool looking, they were fetishized, aestheticized,
*  and there's definitely an aspect of that that's important in architecture.
*  But I've always felt that really architecture is much larger than that.
*  Buildings are living things that exist in our lives, in our neighborhoods, communities,
*  cities, and they're there whether we choose to look at them or not.
*  They have to be used.
*  And so really they raise these questions of what do they say about us as a society?
*  And in the case of Notre Dame, it's been speaking.
*  It's meant things to people over generations, over centuries, for almost a thousand years.
*  Well, tell us a little bit about that history, and I suspect through that we will understand
*  what it has meant to us during that entire period.
*  Well, I think, you know, the building has had a lot of meanings over time.
*  You first of all have to see where it sits geographically.
*  It sits at the center of Paris on an island in the middle of the Seine River.
*  And that island is where what came to be called Paris started.
*  Literally.
*  Literally.
*  It had been a prehistoric settlement and then was an ancient settlement.
*  The Romans settled there.
*  It was a Gallo-Roman town called Lutetia, occupied by the Parisii.
*  I didn't know any of this.
*  There you go.
*  You're welcome.
*  I hope it's true.
*  And then when the church was there, there was original religious buildings and sanctuaries
*  built on the island over centuries.
*  It was invaded by Vikings.
*  And then eventually in the 12th century, a bishop of Paris decided that they should build
*  a Gothic cathedral there.
*  And this was the new style.
*  It was a little like the pyramids in the sense that these were buildings of an incredible
*  scale and ambition and weirdness and majesty, complexity.
*  So they tore down some of the old church buildings, which were on the east end of the island,
*  and started erecting this building.
*  And since then, that was in the 1160s, the building has remained the center of the city.
*  It's essentially witnessed the growth of the city.
*  It's been the sun around which the city has revolved.
*  It's the place from which all distances in France are measured.
*  Literally.
*  There's a plaque on the plaza in front of it.
*  In other words, all French roads quite literally lead to this cathedral.
*  That's right.
*  And everything circulates around it.
*  But I think also it has witnessed a lot of important events in French history.
*  Mary, Queen of Scots, was married there.
*  Napoleon was coronated there.
*  And when the revolution happened, you had the insurgence of revolution.
*  They ransacked Notre Dame.
*  It was a symbol.
*  They hated the church.
*  They knocked off the heads of the Old Testament figures on the front, who they thought were
*  kings.
*  And they melted down the bells and turned them into cannonballs and coins.
*  It's fascinating because what could better embody the idea of a single building's importance
*  to a place than it becomes a central target of an effort to overturn the entire system?
*  Yeah.
*  By the time of Napoleon, right after the revolution, the place was a wreck.
*  It was a dump.
*  It had been ruined during the revolution, but it was also falling apart.
*  When Napoleon decided to have his coronation there, it was so bad that he had to get a
*  couple of architects, like very high-level interior decorators, to basically hang a lot
*  of tapestries to cover up all the mess behind it, like a stage set.
*  Then that also caused Victor Hugo, the writer, to write a book about a hunchback bell ringer
*  in which he spends a chapter lamenting what had happened to Notre Dame, that this was
*  said, what it said about France and what Notre Dame meant to the country.
*  I don't think we can miss an opportunity, since you brought it with you, to read from
*  the hunchback of Notre Dame and understand what it was about the way Hugo wrote about
*  it that inspired people to want to make it better and restore it.
*  Yeah.
*  He wrote in, shall we say, ripe prose and in long, voluptuous sentences, but I'll read
*  you a couple.
*  First of all, he begins this chapter about Notre Dame.
*  He says, the Church of Notre Dame de Paris is without doubt, even today, a sublime and
*  majestic building, but however much it may have conserved its beauty as it has grown
*  older, it is hard not to regret, not to feel indignation at the numberless degradations
*  and mutilations which time and men have wrought simultaneously on this venerable monument.
*  It's a call to arms.
*  It's a call to arms, exactly.
*  Great buildings, he says, like great mountains, are the works of centuries.
*  The man, the individual, and the artist are erased from these great piles which bear no
*  author's name.
*  They are the summary and summation of human intelligence.
*  Time is the architect, the nation, the builder, which I think is interesting, Michael, because
*  that's the point.
*  Notre Dame, for him, represented France.
*  So its recovery, its preservation, was about France's preservation, its heritage, its strength.
*  Hugo had no particular patience with the church, but he believed that the building itself meant
*  a lot to the nation.
*  And that book came at the same time as a movement was rising in France to preserve its heritage.
*  And those two things led to the restoration of Notre Dame in the 19th century to prevent
*  its collapse, basically, and to restore it.
*  And that was a key moment in the history of not just Notre Dame and Paris, but the whole
*  idea of historic preservation globally.
*  It reminds me of what you said at the beginning of this conversation about architecture, is
*  that this is not some abstract piece of architecture.
*  It's living, it's breathing, it tells us something essential about who we are at any given moment.
*  And Hugo, as you said, he's not saying that through an especially religious lens.
*  He's seeing this more as a secular temple.
*  A palace of the people, that's right.
*  He saw it as representing all sorts of romantic ideals about the people, about community,
*  about glory.
*  And that book helped inspire the renovation of the cathedral in the 19th century.
*  It was brought back.
*  We got the spire that then became famous on the Paris skyline.
*  Hugo's book also made it more of an attraction.
*  People wanted to come to Paris to see the building.
*  Eventually Disney wanted to make movies about it.
*  People from all over the world came, more of them than went to see the Eiffel Tower
*  in Paris, more of them than went to visit the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
*  And in that sense, it really did become truly a palace of the people.
*  And so what did this fire say about us, about this moment, that the horror of it was that
*  Our moment would be the moment when this building across this great arc of history would disappear.
*  What did that say about how we had cared for it?
*  And even the fact that it was on fire was clearly an indication that we'd been derelict.
*  It was a fire that never needed to happen.
*  And it wasn't a great world war that had destroyed other cathedrals.
*  It was a guy who probably left a cigarette butt lighted in the rafters.
*  And then somebody else who went to the wrong place to check out why there was an alarm.
*  It seemed so banal.
*  And it seemed like it said something about us in this moment.
*  Well, since you just brought it up, remind us how severe this fire ends up being.
*  It was really severe.
*  It started in the rafters.
*  And the rafters are made out of oak, wood, and spread to the spire, which is made out
*  of wood too, and lead.
*  Right.
*  You were wrong when you were on the bike, telling your editor it couldn't burn.
*  There's a lot of wood in that cathedral.
*  I was extremely wrong.
*  And it wasn't just the roof was on fire and the spire was collapsing.
*  It was a very dangerous and complex thing for the firemen to try to put this fire out.
*  They couldn't dump water from above.
*  The cathedral might collapse.
*  It was a building they didn't want to use powerful hoses in.
*  They had to go inside and try to put it out.
*  There was a point at which they went into the bell towers in order to prevent them from
*  collapsing.
*  If they had, the whole building would have gone down.
*  So what started as a fire store by cigarette butt was really a kind of existential crisis
*  for Notre Dame and for the world.
*  Right.
*  And the question immediately became, what do you do after one of the world's great,
*  important, essential, beloved buildings is this badly damaged?
*  So there were different answers to that question.
*  And at first, it wasn't clear what would happen.
*  There were a lot of proposals to do something really crazy on the roof to use essentially
*  this calamity as an opportunity.
*  Huh.
*  Crazy like what?
*  Well, the French prime minister hastily proposed that there be an architectural competition
*  to reimagine the roof.
*  That's an invitation for every wackadoodle proposal you can imagine.
*  Architects salivated the prospect of such a proposal.
*  So circulating online pretty quickly were all sorts of things.
*  Swimming pool, garden.
*  Someone came up with the idea of like a giant carbon fiber gold leaf flame to replace the
*  spire.
*  Well, that's on the nose.
*  Yeah.
*  It actually bore uncanny resemblance to the logo for Chicken Wings franchise in Colorado.
*  And there were a lot of those things.
*  But relatively soon, coolerheads, including some prominent French architects, persuaded
*  the French government to do the right thing, which was to restore the cathedral as it had
*  been.
*  And that became the mission.
*  And Macron, the president, even while the building was still smoldering, promised that
*  it would be restored in five years, which back then seemed not just a Hail Mary, it
*  seemed completely crazy.
*  Impossible.
*  To you too?
*  Everybody.
*  Yes, I thought it was nuts.
*  I even told my editors there was absolutely no way this would happen in five years.
*  Twenty years, we'll check in in 10 years, don't worry about this.
*  There's nothing really to see here.
*  And it turns out I was wrong again.
*  And here we are five years later.
*  The building has been reopened.
*  It's on time, on budget.
*  And it's incredible.
*  It's a kind of miracle.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Michael, tell us how France did this, how they pulled this on time miracle off.
*  Well, the president, Macron, assigned a general to run the operation named Georges
*  Hollain, and he ran it like a military operation.
*  They cordoned off the cathedral.
*  It meant you had essentially like a mystery in plain sight.
*  You couldn't see what was happening on the other side of it.
*  They shared what information they wanted.
*  Otherwise, it was really impossible to get a look.
*  I had wanted to embed myself there from the beginning to watch the process and to try
*  to see what was going to happen day to day because I thought it would be an incredibly
*  interesting project to follow.
*  And they certainly weren't having any of that.
*  They basically told you no way.
*  They were preoccupied.
*  And I understand.
*  And they surrounded the cathedral with this wall that told you information about Notre
*  Dame and eventually showed pictures of some of the workers.
*  But you could never see on the other side of it.
*  You would occasionally see, you know, stuff going on in the cranes.
*  Obviously, on the scaffolding.
*  But it was really hard to know what was going on for a long time.
*  And finally, after five years of begging and pleading and leaning really heavily on our
*  wonderful colleague Aurelien Breeden in Paris, we got the word in June.
*  We could come in one day next week.
*  I didn't know what that meant, whether we had an hour or 45 minutes, whether we had two
*  hours. We had the whole day.
*  I didn't know who we were seeing, but I packed my bags and flew to Paris.
*  Right. So this is not exactly living inside the cathedral as you had originally saw.
*  But you have this chance.
*  So tell us about this one day you get to go inside.
*  I land in Paris. I meet Aurelien for breakfast nearby.
*  We walk over the cathedral and we're told we have to strip naked and put on basically
*  a hazmat suit.
*  I'm sorry. What?
*  Yeah. So I was a little taken aback and I asked a couple of times, like naked naked?
*  Like French naked?
*  So I think what this probably was about was a holdover from the fact that there had been
*  concerns about the lead.
*  A component of the original construction.
*  Right. Of the spire and the roof.
*  And so they wanted to take extravagant cautionary steps to make sure that everyone came in
*  and out, was not taking lead out from the cathedral.
*  But by this point, that was a moot issue.
*  But fine, I would have done anything.
*  So I go through a security turnstile and enter this container village, invisible from the
*  outside almost. But there it is.
*  Hundreds of workers.
*  A real beehive.
*  We're meeting the woman who's going to take us around and we go to this construction
*  elevator and rise up to the roof, which was incredible.
*  Seeing Paris in a way I'd never seen it.
*  Seeing the cathedral in a way I'd never seen it.
*  Seeing the workers there who seemed on the whole remarkably happy.
*  Are you happy you are here?
*  A bit.
*  Yeah?
*  A bit.
*  Only a bit.
*  I'd understand.
*  You know, construction sites are not usually happy places, particularly.
*  It's a lot of stress.
*  And there was certainly a lot of stress and concern here at deadlines.
*  But there was really different atmosphere, a different vibe.
*  What was it?
*  I think for all of the stresses, there was a shared feeling of omission.
*  People were working on something that was bigger, longer lasting themselves.
*  And that, you know, they were proud of.
*  The kind of job I think I'm not going to do again.
*  At least not on this roof.
*  There are many times when I could have left and I haven't left here.
*  Still not born.
*  They would go home at night and, you know, they could say to their
*  spouses, what did you do today?
*  I worked on Notre Dame.
*  What did you do?
*  An impossible thing to match.
*  Hard to top.
*  And that's something of what I felt from talking to some of these workers as well.
*  There was a collegiality.
*  Some of them worked for competing firms, but here they would share
*  hammers and help each other out.
*  We are all really friendly together.
*  They were doing all sorts of stuff.
*  They were laying down sheets of lead.
*  They were erecting the spire.
*  And most interestingly to me, they were rebuilding the rafters,
*  this complex of beams.
*  All that wood that had burned.
*  Exactly.
*  Five years ago.
*  So I go through this, basically a hole in the roof and enter this
*  forest of reconstructed rafters.
*  Very beautiful.
*  These trusses that had been rebuilt.
*  And, you know, it was providential.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, before the fire, the cathedral was in disrepair.
*  The roof was leaking.
*  Some of that wood was rotting.
*  Repairs had started on the cathedral, but also there were some people who
*  tried to document the cathedral.
*  There were a couple of French architects who'd gone up at the rafters and the
*  spire and recorded every detail of what there was down to the finest degree.
*  And there was a Belgian scholar who had used LIDAR to do a digital scan of the
*  cathedral from all different sorts of points and gathered like a billion points
*  of data.
*  It was amazing.
*  Which gave the workers a map effectively of the cathedral down to the width of a
*  pencil eraser.
*  So the reconstruction could be extraordinarily faithful.
*  What I learned from the workers was that each tree that had been cut down in
*  forests across France had been specifically chosen to match the peculiarities of the
*  beam that it would replace, the medieval beam, which had been faithfully studied
*  before.
*  It's interesting because he's basically saying they did the opposite of what the
*  Middle Age carpenters did.
*  The Middle Age carpenters, they found a tree and then they worked with that tree.
*  And they worked the opposite.
*  They looked at what they had and then they had to look for a tree that matched what
*  they had.
*  Exactly.
*  But they had to reproduce.
*  I'm trying to envision people going out into the forests of France, looking at trees
*  and saying, ah, that one is worthy of that beam.
*  You'll remember Francois and the rafters up there cut down that tree.
*  Exactly.
*  And then the carpenters today, using the same sort of old hand tools, made sure that
*  the contours of that beam down to all sorts of peculiarities in the Middle Ages were
*  exactly the same.
*  And this wasn't just for authenticity sake.
*  The same method.
*  It's incredible, really, because you're reviving ancient techniques.
*  Not for the folklore, but also because there was a reason why.
*  They had 800 years.
*  And that's pretty good.
*  Exactly.
*  Oh, that's pretty good.
*  This was because the previous beams had lasted for 800 years.
*  Huh.
*  And then they had tattooed back into it the medieval carpenters original mark.
*  And if there had been beams that had been reconstructed in the 19th century, they
*  added those back too.
*  That's extraordinary.
*  Yeah.
*  It was especially extraordinary because not just was it faithful, but it was something
*  that the public will not see.
*  So it wasn't done for tourists.
*  It was about something else.
*  It was devotional.
*  Devotional to the original workers and the original mission and meaning of this
*  entire cathedral.
*  Exactly.
*  Devotional to the techniques that date back really thousands of years.
*  One of the things that was going on here was to help to resuscitate what are
*  basically artisanal, ancestral crafts and techniques.
*  There's a group called the Compagnon du Dauvoir, which dates back to the 12th
*  century group of artisans.
*  And there were more than a thousand applications when the decision was made to
*  restore the cathedral, people who wanted to participate in this project.
*  And that was in some ways, one of the most beautiful things about Notre Dame.
*  One of the guys who was from that organization had said to me that it's a reminder of
*  the dignity of labor and of craft.
*  And I saw that in the workers themselves because it was not just reopening a
*  tourist site.
*  It was reviving a whole culture.
*  It was sustaining something that had lasted for nearly a thousand years.
*  I'm curious, once you get down from the roof and you are witnessing this
*  exceptionally faithful devotional effort to bring the roof back to what it looked
*  like a thousand years ago, what you saw on the interior, probably the best known
*  portions of Notre Dame.
*  So, you know, entering the cathedral was disorienting at first.
*  First of all, it was a construction site sill.
*  So there were, you know, people moving heavy equipment and there's still a lot of
*  scaffolding and tarp.
*  But pretty quickly it became clear to me what had happened.
*  I could see suddenly that the cathedral was spanking clean, bright.
*  And I looked up and there had been all these famous images of the collapsed vaults,
*  these giant black holes in the ceiling.
*  And now they had been repaired.
*  Now you had a new ceiling and it was spick and span and bright.
*  And this kaleidoscopic light coming through these stained glass windows, which
*  survived the fire.
*  But what was also a kind of miracle was that that work in creating those digital
*  maps before the fire allowed the people reconstructing it to even reproduce the
*  sound of the cathedral.
*  Wow.
*  Because every material, every angle, every quality of the building could be
*  reproduced now.
*  One of the organists who works there spoke to me about this.
*  A building like that is it's a kind of organ pipe, he said.
*  It's a volume that has a certain patient quality.
*  He said D major sounds really good in Notre Dame.
*  And that is often what you experience when you come in.
*  It's not just looking at things, it's hearing them, feel you're surrounded by a
*  particular sound.
*  That's what I was sensing, that the soul of the building had come back in a sense,
*  which included not just the way it looked, but the way it felt and sounded.
*  Well, that makes me wonder as an architecture critic, did you have by the
*  end of this tour, by end of this coveted day that you got, some kind of final
*  assessment of the experience of this building?
*  I mean, I think that's a really interesting question.
*  I mean, I think that's a really interesting question.
*  I mean, I think that's a really interesting question.
*  What is your final assessment of the experience of this restored cathedral?
*  Yeah, Michael, you know, I think at this point, after nearly a thousand years, no
*  one really needs me to assess whether Notre Dame is a good building or not.
*  Three stars.
*  Yeah.
*  Honestly, it's a little shocking at first to go in, and I think some people will
*  experience this.
*  You know, when the Sistine Chapel was cleaned some decades ago, people had gotten
*  used to looking at all that Roman grime and kind of they'd become attached to that
*  quality of the Michelangelo's covered with dirt and looking sort of dark and
*  aged.
*  Mysterious aged, yeah.
*  And then the grime was taken off and everyone thought it looked like a
*  Superman comic.
*  It was just so bright.
*  Now, of course, people have become accustomed to that.
*  I think there may be some of that kind of adjustment.
*  Basically, you should prepare yourself for going inside a thousand-year-old building
*  that has been power washed.
*  Yes, that's exactly correct.
*  But I think it looked obviously really remarkable.
*  And I did come away with something not just about the building, but a feeling that the
*  project itself represented something very moving.
*  So few things nowadays seem sort of unimpeachable and just good.
*  And that was the main takeaway I had about this project.
*  It had not just gone well, but it seemed to be something that brought people together.
*  It seemed to be something people could attribute larger meaning to.
*  Well, you're getting at the question I've been waiting to ask you this entire conversation,
*  which is if architecture, as you have laid out here, tells us something about us, what
*  did this renovation, this project, tell us about ourselves right now?
*  Well, for starters, it tells us that this is not the moment when we let Notre Dame die,
*  that we are capable of bringing it back to life.
*  And that's a sign of hope.
*  I mean, Notre Dame is not going to solve everyone's problems.
*  France is still coming apart, walk down the street, you still worry about whether there's
*  going to be crime and homelessness.
*  I don't want to overstate the case.
*  But I do think Notre Dame reminds us that the places we build give us this sense of
*  community, they give us a sense of each other, the coming together itself, which is what
*  the cathedral is about, is a sign of hope for us.
*  It's the thing that we wish we can do.
*  It's our best selves.
*  It's our best selves.
*  Right.
*  Notre Dame is our best selves.
*  And now it's in the best shape that it's ever been in probably a thousand years.
*  That's not a sign of human progress.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, I met a lot of people, Parisians, some friends of mine, who had never really
*  thought much about Notre Dame or actually just found an impediment on their way to work,
*  all the crowds.
*  And they found themselves crestfallen, shocked really by how they felt when it burned.
*  And I think that was the realization for many people that this building had a place in their
*  own lives that they hadn't even understood before.
*  It's a touchstone for our sense of our own changing, evolving lives, aging.
*  And I think also for the passage of time in a larger sense over the centuries to which
*  we are connected.
*  And the building's resurrection preserves that connection.
*  It allows us to think we can go back.
*  We haven't lost touch essentially with not just with the past, but with ourselves.
*  Just before I left the cathedral, I was speaking with the woman who showed us around.
*  And I asked her directly, are you Catholic?
*  And she said, yes.
*  So I said to her, what is it meant for you to be working on this project?
*  And she struggled for like a minute to find the words.
*  And then she wept.
*  And I thought that said it all really.
*  That for her, this was also something that she would remember for the rest of her life.
*  That she lived at this moment.
*  For her, no doubt had religious meanings, but I'd like to think is the power of architecture
*  and can sustain us at a time when we are divided and we sometimes lose hope.
*  Maybe that was the original idea for the people who built the cathedral nearly a thousand
*  years ago.
*  Oh, Michael, on that really beautiful note, thank you very, very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  It's been a pleasure.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, Israel said it had destroyed Syria's Navy during a series of airstrikes in what
*  it described as defensive measures designed to protect itself against Syria's new government.
*  But the attacks have defied warnings from Western governments who fear they may ignite
*  conflict in the region and fear that Israel is using the fall of Syria's government as
*  an opportunity to take offensive actions.
*  As the Assad government fell over the weekend, Israeli ground forces advanced beyond the
*  demilitarized zone on the Israeli-Syria border, marking Israel's first overt entry into Syrian
*  territory in more than 50 years.
