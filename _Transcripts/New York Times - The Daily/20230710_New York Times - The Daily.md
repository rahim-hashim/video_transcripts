# Will Threads Kill Twitter?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMDhyNAqRg8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroweth.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Last week, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, released a new social media
*  platform to rival Twitter.
*  It quickly became the most rapidly downloaded app ever.
*  Today, my colleague Mike Isaac on how Twitter became so vulnerable and the challenges Meta
*  faces in its quest to make a less toxic alternative.
*  It's Monday, July 10th.
*  Mike, as all of us very online people know, and I honestly think maybe everyone else at
*  this point is aware, Meta just launched this Twitter-like product that they call Threads.
*  And it's been lighting the internet on fire.
*  Please help us understand what's going on here.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think Meta basically just sees an opportunity to dethrone Twitter.
*  As you might remember, Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and they've wanted to
*  add a Twitter-like app to the company's growing platform of different apps that they own,
*  which some folks are calling Twitter Killer.
*  And you know, the reason they think they can actually do this now is because Twitter is
*  in a pretty diminished state.
*  And I don't think you need to be a tech reporter to see it.
*  If you just open the app and look at how things are going, it's pretty messed up right now.
*  Should we look at it together?
*  Yeah, I mean, as soon as I open the site right now, I'm seeing, you know, a bunch of
*  reply guys.
*  What is a reply guy?
*  Just remind me.
*  It's a...
*  Do you ever like tweet something or maybe this is just me, but tweet something benign
*  about my life and then like 50 dudes will come up and say, actually, I think you're an
*  idiot. That's basically much of life on Twitter.
*  But reply guys aren't really new.
*  What's new is that these small accounts with basically no followers, people I'm not
*  following, are all of a sudden pushed to the top of my feed.
*  What else do I have here?
*  I'm getting hit with some...
*  Oh, that's nice, some spam in my replies and a bunch of crypto bots trying to sell me
*  something.
*  So not great.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just that it's a really spammy place.
*  I mean, I feel like I don't really have control of anything.
*  Totally.
*  I think not feeling in control is like the operative phrase here because I don't have
*  any idea what's going on.
*  Right.
*  And for many of us who've been watching this and also have been reading your reporting,
*  a big part of this story of the current state of Twitter seems to have a lot to do with
*  the current owner, Elon Musk.
*  A hundred percent.
*  So he's used the site for years and he's clearly really enjoyed it.
*  But he decided to pay 44 billion dollars for a company that for a long time has not
*  actually been a profitable company.
*  Nine out of the 10 years, I believe, that it was public, it was not making money.
*  And so he bought this sort of, you know, foundering business.
*  But he also did it kind of to make more of an ideological point.
*  And his whole thing has been, you know, free unfettered speech on the Internet is going
*  away. He wants to make this company a viable business and make it sort of free speech for
*  everyone. No rules, no moderation.
*  The ultimate poster is paradise of Twitter, basically.
*  He wants to make money and transform Twitter at the same time.
*  How does he go about doing that?
*  Yeah. So Musk's entire thing is cut, cut, cut.
*  His whole sort of history of really running companies has been to pare down the finances
*  as slim as possible.
*  So at first, he basically lays off a third of the company.
*  And over the months ahead, continues to cut more and more people till there's probably
*  a couple thousand folks left at the company.
*  How controversial was this idea that Twitter was really bloated?
*  Was that a Musk thing or did other people agree with him?
*  Well, I think, yeah, to be fair to Musk, like a lot of companies did actually do layoffs
*  over the past year. But there's like, you know, trimming the fat and then there's cutting
*  to the bone. And he definitely cut to the bone.
*  So Musk lays off a ton of people, including gutting the team in charge of content
*  moderation. Yeah.
*  So his other sort of qualm with Twitter is that they were banning a lot of the
*  prominent conservative voices that he thought should be on the platform, you know, from
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene's account to Donald Trump's account to all sorts of other
*  folks who he thought were either unduly banned or shouldn't be banned just because
*  everyone should be having a voice.
*  So he flips the switch.
*  He basically is like, everyone come back and start posting.
*  It felt for a while there that Twitter kind of became the Elon Musk show.
*  I mean, he was boosting people he liked.
*  Right. And he was inserting himself into the site.
*  And it just seemed one weirdly personal.
*  And it also just seemed a little unstable.
*  Totally. And it became a lot more political in ways that really upset a lot of folks,
*  especially, I would say, the people who pay to serve ads on Twitter.
*  And that led to problems for the business, basically.
*  Talking about the most contentious issues that we have in our society today and things
*  that a lot of people don't agree on already is not exactly something that is going to
*  get me to buy a Coke when I see the tweet in my feet.
*  Right.
*  Totally.
*  So basically all this made advertisers super uncomfortable.
*  And they decided to start pausing their amount of money that they spend on Twitter.
*  And that really hurt Musk's pocketbook, especially at a time when he needed to be
*  making money instead of losing it.
*  So Twitter's advertising business is plummeting.
*  But for Musk, he never really wanted to rely on that business to begin with.
*  His whole vision from the beginning was to move away from advertising and make Twitter
*  a subscriptions business.
*  And what does that look like?
*  Basically, he wants to make people start paying for Twitter.
*  And so his sort of fixation over time has really focused on the blue check marks next
*  to folks' names across Twitter.
*  You have a blue check mark, right?
*  Or you had, I guess, a blue check mark at one point.
*  I had a blue check mark.
*  It's long gone.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  And that served an important purpose.
*  People could actually say who they were on the platform.
*  And if you or I were scrolling in our feed and saw that blue check mark, we could have
*  the assurance that what they were saying probably was actually them saying it.
*  Right.
*  But for Musk, this system felt all wrong, basically.
*  He thought that Twitter was arbitrarily doling out these blue check marks to people that
*  they thought were influential.
*  But maybe the rest of the world didn't.
*  Or maybe they shouldn't be elevating those people.
*  Or maybe journalists shouldn't have the most prominent voices in his feed.
*  So his idea was essentially to flip that on its head.
*  He wanted anyone on Twitter to be able to get the blue check mark.
*  And to do that, all you needed is eight dollars a month and you could sign up and get
*  that blue check.
*  So first of all, he has people pay for blue check marks.
*  And then everybody who had one, you and I, we lost them unless we were going to pay for
*  them. This is where we get to process the loss of our blue check mark.
*  I'm sure it was traumatic for you as well.
*  I mean, I took a few days off work.
*  No, but I mean, it was a big moment.
*  Right. I mean, there was a complete reversal of the business model happening.
*  In real time, all of a sudden, users are being asked to pay for a particular kind of
*  service. Right.
*  Totally. It essentially made Twitter subscriptions a kind of pay to play model.
*  Now you see someone with a blue check mark in your feed and it just means that they
*  paid eight dollars that month.
*  I mean, I'm wondering, Mike, does the extra revenue from the subscribers, the people
*  paying for blue checks, at least help Twitter's bottom line?
*  That is a good question.
*  So Musk's grand business plan is to offset advertising with subscriptions and people
*  aren't signing up for the service in the numbers that he needs.
*  You know, eight dollars a month from a few hundred thousand people, which were what
*  early reports were saying he got as what's called Twitter blue sign ups.
*  Was not enough. That's only, you know, like a couple million dollars basically in
*  revenue a month, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the few billion they had
*  over the course of a year, basically.
*  So overall, Musk's financial situation is super shaky.
*  When he bought Twitter, he had to take out these enormous loans in order to do so.
*  And the interest payments on these loans are huge.
*  He has to pay billions of dollars just on the interest, much less paying back the
*  actual loans themselves.
*  So in order to finance these payments, he's selling stock from his other company
*  that he owns, Tesla, which is driving down the value of that stock for his company.
*  We also know that he's not paying his bills at Twitter.
*  You know, Twitter is literally getting evicted or threatened eviction at some of
*  its office spaces because he's not paying the rent on his buildings in San
*  Francisco and Seattle and a number of the places that Twitter still has offices.
*  So he's in this really dire financial position.
*  And that's why it was so weird when he came out a little over a week ago and said
*  he was basically putting limits on how many tweets people can actually see.
*  Yeah, so this was really confusing to me, too, because it's the exact opposite of
*  what I thought social media companies were supposed to do.
*  I mean, they want us to spend a lot of time on their sites, right?
*  Because that means more eyeballs on ads.
*  And while Musk has said he doesn't want to rely on ads, you just said his
*  subscription business isn't bringing in any real money.
*  So, Mike, help me understand what is going on here.
*  Yeah, I mean, that was the question I asked initially when I woke up like a week
*  ago and couldn't start scrolling, doom scrolling like I usually do.
*  But as with all things Elon Musk, it is kind of complicated.
*  So here's how he characterized it.
*  Basically, there are a lot of companies in Silicon Valley developing artificial
*  intelligence systems.
*  So Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Metta, et cetera, a bunch of different startups.
*  And companies like Twitter are a great resource for them.
*  You know, it's the largest body of natural language conversations online outside of,
*  say, Reddit or Facebook.
*  So these other companies can basically build bots that scrape all of that data and take
*  all the posts on Twitter and then feed it into their AI systems in order to, you
*  know, ultimately make it sound like those systems are able to have real human
*  conversations with us when we use them.
*  And right now and for pretty much the entire history of the Internet, they've been
*  able to do that entirely for free.
*  So clearly Musk does not like that.
*  He hasn't liked it for a while and he wants them to pay up.
*  The problem is when he's restricting our viewing access, he's not really distinguishing
*  between, you know, regular paid subscribers to Twitter and these bots that are scraping
*  Twitter. So, you know, if you and I are not paying for Twitter, we only get to basically
*  see like several hundred tweets a day now before we're cut off, which I don't know about
*  you, but for me, that is not a lot.
*  I that's probably me in like 15 minutes before I'm done scrolling.
*  Right.
*  Maybe that says something about me.
*  But for Musk, this is really about charging other companies for something they shouldn't
*  be getting for free, which I don't I mean, I think that's not crazy.
*  I think there are other companies doing that right now, too.
*  Reddit has said that they're trying to lock down their data, tell Google and other
*  companies to stop taking their data for free.
*  The problem is he did it in the worst possible way and made everyone else upset across the
*  service, including folks like you and I who use it regularly.
*  But we also know Musk is in this bad place financially with his server agreements, right?
*  Twitter doesn't really rely on its own servers to keep it up and running all the time.
*  It uses servers at Google and Amazon and pays billions of dollars in bills to do that
*  every year. And Musk hasn't been either able or willing to pay for the amount of server
*  space he actually needs to keep Twitter running.
*  So you can also look at the tweet limits as a way for him to kind of save money on those
*  bills. It's probably not all about AI.
*  Yeah, it just sounds like all of this is adding up to be a pretty desperate situation for
*  Musk. Absolutely.
*  The limits on tweets felt like the final straw for a lot of people who were sticking
*  around and, you know, they started looking for other options.
*  There are a bunch of other startups that are trying to kind of do this, step into the
*  space and compete with Twitter.
*  And it's a slower process, I would say, with people migrating there.
*  And for a long time, all these problems Twitter was facing didn't really matter or didn't
*  really threaten its existence to some degree because other folks weren't able to
*  compete at the, let's say at the scale that Twitter was operating at until now.
*  One of the other giants in the social media space, Metta and Mark Zuckerberg, is
*  smelling blood in the water and they introduced a new site of their own.
*  It's called Threads, and it might be the first real existential threat to Twitter's
*  business. We'll be right back.
*  Mike, you just walked me through all these problems with Twitter's social media
*  business, and now in comes Metta trying to move in on that business.
*  Why would Metta want to replicate something that, based on what you just told me, seems
*  like a really challenging business model?
*  This is a totally fair point, but I think Mark Zuckerberg, Metta's CEO, has wanted to
*  own Twitter for a very long time.
*  He tried to buy the company more than a decade ago, and he sees it as part of the
*  social media landscape, another arena that people are talking and conversing online,
*  and he doesn't want another company to own that.
*  He wants to own that.
*  And then they think that, unlike Twitter, which has been consistently unprofitable for
*  a very long time, they can actually make this business work.
*  And why is Metta so confident that it can succeed there where Twitter failed?
*  So Metta is not the first company to think that they can do this.
*  There was Mastodon, which is a little bit more techie version of Twitter with a lot
*  more sort of complication in how to get it going.
*  There's Blue Sky by the co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, but that's slowly inviting
*  people to the network and is run by a very small team with limited resources, I would
*  say. And Metta is different from all these smaller competitors.
*  They have a bunch of built-in advantages.
*  For one, they have almost half the planet using one or more of their services, from
*  Instagram to WhatsApp to Facebook proper.
*  Do you mean that literally half the planet?
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, there's three billion people that use one or more of Metta's
*  services regularly.
*  Wow. I think people forget about the scale of Metta.
*  It is a huge company.
*  And so they have this built-in advantage in Instagram in particular, which is a place
*  where more than two billion people use the app regularly.
*  You need to use Instagram in order to sign up to threads.
*  And one of the ways that helps Metta is that it allows you to basically bring all your
*  Instagram followers over to the new app.
*  It sounds like it's doing two things, right?
*  It's like one, if you have two billion users on Instagram, a small percentage of that is
*  a really decent number of people to start a new social platform with.
*  And then also, it gets rid of that problem that some new social media networks have,
*  which is starting from scratch and having no followers and no audience kind of sucks.
*  So for the individual user, you don't have to do that with this.
*  You have a kind of base from the get-go.
*  100 percent. It's sort of like when I first got to Blue Sky, it was like, I was
*  coming up in the club and I'm the first guy there and the dance floor is empty and I'm
*  trying to get down by myself.
*  Whereas with threads, they wanted it to feel like a party that you got to at like, I'm
*  old, so I would say 11 p.m.
*  But what, 2 a.m.? I don't know.
*  I don't know either. Yeah, I trust you.
*  2 a.m. That's it.
*  And it kind of works.
*  You know, Mark Zuckerberg posted in the first two hours that two million people joined
*  the app by the next morning when he woke up, they were at 30 million people.
*  It just keeps sort of going up and up and up.
*  And the other part of this is that Meta can actually handle this giant influx of people
*  coming in the door on day one.
*  Meta has spent billions of dollars on infrastructure servers over the years to make
*  sure that they don't really have these types of problems and keep their services running.
*  You know, also you have another advantage.
*  Meta has one of the most sophisticated advertising businesses in the entire world.
*  They could essentially hook threads into their existing advertising technology and, you
*  know, potentially sell ads to advertisers who already buy ads on Instagram or Facebook
*  or other Meta properties and apps.
*  And that's potentially lucrative right now.
*  But, you know, for now, they are at least not turning on ads in threads until they get
*  the user experience right.
*  So we went on Twitter.
*  It only feels fair to take a look at threads.
*  Should we go on? Yeah, I actually downloaded it.
*  Am I an early adopter?
*  I was like the four millionth user.
*  Oh, interesting. I was the two thousand seven hundred and sixty eighth user.
*  Just FYI.
*  Wow, Mike.
*  This is a sign you're too online.
*  So immediately upon opening the app, I have a golden retriever puppy in my face.
*  If that's indicative to what the vibe is, I see a rabbit named Leachie, which is really
*  nice. OK, it looks like Twitter, but it doesn't feel like Twitter.
*  I mean, I have a lot of food pictures and I guess there's this piece of this that's
*  just a lot of the people that I follow on Instagram are the people that I am following
*  on threads. But then there's this also sort of jarring thing where it's like, do I want
*  to see all of my Instagram follows inner thoughts unfurl on this app?
*  Totally. I mean, they are super different vibes as far as like what I do on Twitter.
*  Versus what I do on Instagram.
*  Right. And I think Metta also knows that that is an issue.
*  Like they're trying to reckon with that.
*  I spoke to the head of Instagram a few days ago and they said they're going to try to
*  like figure it out. And they hope that the culture kind of forms itself over time.
*  What did he tell you about what Metta wants the app to feel like?
*  So their whole thing is we want this to be a friendly place for conversation online.
*  That is the way that they're trying to distinguish themselves from Twitter.
*  Their whole thing is we know that you go to Twitter and don't feel great when you use
*  it. We want you to come to threads and feel better about having talked to people online
*  on threads after you use it.
*  I mean, it sounds like Metta is saying, yes, this is basically a copy of Twitter, but
*  it's going to be a much nicer version.
*  This is going to be a place to have cordial conversations.
*  But we know that you can't control speech and much less on social media.
*  What makes Metta think that they can keep a positive vibe on the platform?
*  I think their whole deal is the algorithm.
*  Metta, Facebook, Instagram, they have a long history of creating
*  social media feeds that are curated and more specific to what their algorithm believes
*  you and I actually want to see.
*  And so a hallmark of Twitter is essentially what's called reverse chronological order.
*  You see every post from every person you want to follow.
*  Metta's idea of that is if we can curate it algorithmically to show people nicer
*  things, maybe that keeps them coming back.
*  Maybe we don't show them as much political content or news that might be upsetting.
*  You know, maybe we try to stick to, oh, people sure spend a lot of time looking at this
*  dog pic or people like interacting with this celebrity or comedian on here.
*  We're going to promote them much more.
*  I don't know if it'll work.
*  It also doesn't mean that everything is going to be shiny, happy and friendly because
*  Metta wants it to be.
*  Right. This has been a problem in the past for Metta.
*  It's been linked to spreading false information, making political discourse more
*  polarized, sometimes inciting violence here and abroad.
*  Yeah, you're you're totally right.
*  You do not have to look back into the past that far to see a bunch of examples of how
*  algorithmic curation has gotten Metta in trouble.
*  You know, they were early and really instrumental in spreading some of the QAnon
*  groups across Facebook, the conspiracy theorist groups.
*  They had a hand in spreading political messages with ethnic cleansing in Myanmar a
*  few years ago, which was absolutely horrible and really upset people even inside of
*  Metta. And there was the January 6th uprising at the Capitol that initially organized
*  across Facebook groups.
*  So they don't have all the answers necessarily.
*  One thing I will say that Twitter didn't have that Metta does have is at least a bigger
*  budget for content moderation and providing early tools and more sophisticated
*  algorithm detection to take down toxic content.
*  I'm definitely not saying it's perfect and I'm definitely not saying that they do it
*  well all of the time.
*  But compared to Twitter, which has basically no one running things over there, it's at
*  least somewhat better.
*  So, Mike, how is Twitter and Elon Musk responding to this new threat from Metta?
*  Not well, I would say that Musk is not happy.
*  He had his lawyer basically send a legal threat to Metta's counsel, essentially saying
*  you're stealing our intellectual property, you're poaching our employees, you're
*  cheating. He went on Twitter and said competition is fine, cheating is not.
*  Essentially saying you guys are cloning us and we may sue you if you don't knock it
*  off. Yeah, he's not happy and he shouldn't be happy because he spent 44 billion dollars
*  trying to make this thing work.
*  And the biggest social media company in the world might come and eat his lunch.
*  I also find it really interesting that a lot of the chatter on threads and Twitter
*  about what's happening has this kind of euphoric aspect to it where it really does
*  feel as though a lot of people are rooting for threads and are rooting for Metta, the
*  biggest social media holding company in the world that has been accused over and over
*  of many of the same issues that have plagued Twitter.
*  And we're just allowing this company to own more of our time.
*  And I just I wonder what that says about the moment that we're in right now.
*  Dude, if you would have told me a year ago that people would be rooting for Mark Zuckerberg
*  and Metta to beat Twitter, to clone Twitter and to stamp it out, I would have told you
*  you're crazy. But it speaks to how upset people are with Elon Musk and some of the
*  changes he's made to this service that people love and hate at the same time.
*  You know, it probably speaks to Zuckerberg coming in at the exact right moment and
*  realizing that he has a foil that he can sort of put himself against and look good.
*  But to your point, it also is another moment where Metta only gets bigger and bigger.
*  And I think folks should probably at least reckon with that when they're making some
*  of these decisions and how that makes them feel if they're comfortable with it.
*  Mike, I'm also wondering what this says about us, that the replacement for Twitter
*  wasn't just going outside, you know, with I know that sounds quaint, but I'm this is
*  a real question. I mean, yeah, when Twitter started to spiral, I think there was a sense
*  of relief among some people.
*  And I'm outing myself here that there was gratitude that we would no longer have to
*  care about being on this platform that had become often hateful and toxic.
*  And then and I'm including myself here.
*  As soon as another viable option came along, we all said, yep, we'll try it.
*  I think about this a lot just in the context of really the Internet and social media.
*  You know, I think humans do have some desire to connect to one another.
*  And it's a real love hate relationship with how the Internet fundamentally works.
*  I don't see people logging off forever just because Twitter is not working.
*  I feel like that just becomes the moment where maybe you start looking for the next
*  thing. We're seeing an interesting thing happening with this kind of optimism that
*  maybe another company can do it differently, or at least being open to the idea that
*  there's another service people can use.
*  You know, you see all these folks jumping on board immediately and at least trying it
*  out, which is, I guess, the best the medical hope for.
*  And I've seen this happen a bunch of times before in Silicon Valley, too.
*  So there's no guarantee of success here.
*  I don't know if you remember Google+, for example, but just because they have big
*  numbers early on doesn't mean that they're going to stick around.
*  That said, maybe Meadow will figure out some parts of this, I don't know, secret
*  formula of a non-toxic and actually responsible social media platform.
*  I'm a little skeptical just because they don't have the greatest track record, but
*  there's no question they absolutely have the power to at least change digital
*  culture and tech history and how people communicate online.
*  I just don't think we're going to see that on day one.
*  I think we're going to have to wait till, you know, year one is over to see if this
*  thing actually sticks around.
*  Mike, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  A self-described white nationalist who killed 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso,
*  Texas, was sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences on Friday.
*  The gunman, who had written that he thought Hispanics were, quote,
*  invading America, pled guilty to federal hate crime charges in the 2019 mass
*  shooting, one of the deadliest attacks on Latinos in U.S.
*  history. He still faces a separate state murder trial where Texas prosecutors
*  have said they will seek the death penalty.
*  And after meeting with economic policymakers in Beijing, Treasury
*  Secretary Janet Yellen promised the U.S.
*  and China would pursue more frequent communication and said the budget
*  despite deep differences.
*  Yellen's trip to China, the first by a U.S.
*  Treasury secretary in four years, did not produce any new agreements or policy
*  announcements, but it was seen as a positive step toward easing tensions
*  between the two countries.
