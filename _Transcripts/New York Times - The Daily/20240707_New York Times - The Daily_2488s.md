# 'Animal,' Episode 6: Bats
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VYr_psnuXA)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Today we have something really special for you.
*  A blissful break from the news.
*  It's a new series from NYT Audio called Animal.
*  My colleague Sam Anderson from the Times Magazine traveled the world to have encounters with
*  animals, not to claim them or to tame them, but just to appreciate them.
*  Each episode is a journey to get closer to a creature that Sam loves.
*  For the next six weeks, we'll be running this limited series every Sunday here on the
*  Daily Feed.
*  But if you want to hear all the episodes right now, you can search for it wherever you get
*  your podcasts.
*  Today our final episode, episode six.
*  Hope you enjoy it.
*  One of the very worst things I've ever read in my whole entire life is this poem by DH
*  Lawrence called Bat.
*  At evening, sitting on this terrace, even in Florence, when the sun from the west beyond
*  Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara departs and the world is taken by surprise.
*  DH Lawrence actually wrote some really great poems about animals, about goats and elephants
*  and even snakes.
*  But something about bats just breaks his brain.
*  This poem is 100% trash talking.
*  These creatures that disgust him.
*  And the poem ends with the dumbest ending I've ever encountered in the work of a major
*  writer.
*  The bat is symbol for happiness.
*  Not for me!
*  The New York Times, this is Animal.
*  I'm Sam Anderson.
*  Episode six.
*  Bats.
*  Bats, I hate them.
*  I hate those things.
*  They suck.
*  Bats.
*  Poem.
*  I mean, for a little context.
*  I'm reading this stupid poem in a rental car, hurtling forward into the jungles of
*  Mexico.
*  There's a fear of having a bat stuck in your hair.
*  And driving the car is my dear wonderful friend, Alan, one of my favorite animals on Earth.
*  He's actually the one who introduced me to this bat poem in the first place.
*  I hate it.
*  Not for me!
*  Alan and I met in our 20s, when we were young and innocent and had beautiful fluffy hair.
*  It is true that you and I have known each other for 22 years.
*  But a lot has happened since then.
*  There have been births and deaths and all kinds of big life changes.
*  Now Alan and I live on opposite coasts.
*  But we're still always talking to each other about everything.
*  Including our dream of taking this big trip together to Mexico, which is where Alan is
*  from.
*  And now we are here, on that trip, in the Yucatan, one of the most epic places on Earth.
*  This is the place where the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs hit.
*  Where Maya civilization rose and fell.
*  The beauty of Mayan culture is art.
*  All of it is art.
*  And now it's this wild explosion of biodiversity.
*  I mean look, to your right, as you can see, it's like lizards and toucans and monkeys
*  and jaguars and manatees.
*  Manatees?
*  You haven't seen, but you'll see.
*  All animals I would love to spend time with.
*  But that's not why we're here.
*  We have come to the Yucatan to meet an animal that I do not particularly want to spend time
*  with.
*  Bats!
*  The bat.
*  Because my attitude toward bats is pretty close to DH Lawrence's.
*  I am slightly embarrassed to admit they're not for me.
*  We are all driving into the unknown together.
*  We're like, we're here for the fat.
*  It's a pretty uncomfortable place to be.
*  My family actually likes to make fun of me for being afraid of bats.
*  Yeah, there's a famous story in my family at the time.
*  Because one time a bat flew into a room I was in and I allegedly screamed and shoved
*  my mother-in-law out of the way.
*  Pushed her out of the way.
*  Allegedly.
*  And just ran, went running out of...
*  But in my defense, it's not just me.
*  Bats are spooky.
*  Like famously spooky.
*  They live in the dark, they can carry diseases, they bite.
*  If you want to turn a normal house into a haunted house, you can just put some bats
*  on it.
*  All the others, I was very drawn to all of those creatures.
*  And this is the first one that I will run away screaming from.
*  So why are we going to see them?
*  Because of that, no?
*  Yeah.
*  Because of that.
*  But I didn't want to feel this way.
*  I wanted to want to understand bats.
*  I wanted to get close to them and not run away screaming.
*  I wanted to give them the respect and curiosity that I have for all the rest of the animal
*  kingdom.
*  But how are you supposed to get to know a bat?
*  Okay.
*  Well, you find someone who knows the bats.
*  Hello.
*  We don't need you.
*  How are you?
*  Is Rodrigo Medellin.
*  Sam, very good to meet you.
*  Okay, so.
*  So Alan and I, along with my colleague, Caitlin Roberts, meet up with Rodrigo and his bat
*  team in the lobby of a very pink hotel in the tiny town of Shpuhil.
*  We just order something to eat.
*  Which is in one of the more jungly parts of the Yucatan Peninsula, down south near the
*  border with Guatemala.
*  So the students that we have here, I have three students here.
*  Angel is starting.
*  Rodrigo is a professor of ecology at UNAM, the big university in Mexico City.
*  Javier, who is gathering his data for his thesis.
*  He and his students have been studying the bats of the Yucatan for years.
*  So we're going to take them out, we're going to process them, which means measure, weigh,
*  see the...
*  In the nature world, especially in the bat world, Rodrigo is a real celebrity.
*  He's actually famous for helping to save a whole species of bat from the brink of extinction.
*  It's called the lesser long-nosed bat.
*  And he's agreed to let us tag along with him and his students while they do their bat work
*  this week.
*  And while we're all sitting around chatting, getting to know each other.
*  Who's this on your lock screen of your phone?
*  I noticed the photo on the lock screen of Rodrigo's phone.
*  This is Vampirium Spectrum.
*  The biggest bat in the continent and the biggest carnivorous bat of the world.
*  How big?
*  What?
*  It's body?
*  And how wide its wings?
*  What?
*  No!
*  Almost a meter.
*  It is terrifying.
*  If you've ever had a nightmare about a bat, this is probably what you saw.
*  It has huge, veiny ears and beady black eyes and this long snout full of murder teeth.
*  I imagine bats always just eating like little mosquitoes.
*  Not these guys.
*  When they bite you, you really feel the bite.
*  Its body is like the size of a small dog.
*  And its wingspan is like a hawk.
*  Yeah, and it is a hawk because the wings are very broad and he's very maneuverable.
*  A little question.
*  Are bats social animals?
*  And it's clear that Rodrigo just lives for bats.
*  He gets so excited telling us about this big freaky bat.
*  And not just that bat.
*  He's excited about every bat on earth.
*  And he wants to tell us about all of them.
*  And then he comes back, lands on top of the females and he salts them.
*  What they eat.
*  Where they live.
*  How they mate.
*  That disgusting mix that he has in his sack fall on the females.
*  He's marking his females that way.
*  What the hell?
*  Bats are gross.
*  I'm sorry guys.
*  Oh my god.
*  I'm going to tell you.
*  I know.
*  Can you tell me why you are not terrified of bats?
*  I would trade you and ask you why are you terrified of bats?
*  I don't get it when people are terrified of bats.
*  I really don't.
*  You've never screamed and run away from a bat?
*  Me?
*  Absolutely not.
*  Never, never, never, never.
*  Rodrigo isn't only a bat scientist.
*  He is a bat evangelist.
*  I started my first bat gaming to my house when I was 13 years old.
*  What is that?
*  Do the math.
*  It all started when he was a tiny little kid.
*  He loved animals.
*  He says the first word he ever said was flamingo.
*  He told us he pronounced it glu-glingo or something like that.
*  And he was actually kind of a prodigy.
*  Rodrigo knew so much about animals that he ended up on this famous prime time game show
*  in Mexico called El Gran Premio de los 64,000 pesos, the 64,000 peso grand prize.
*  And so this little kid is on prime time TV answering every question they could throw
*  at him about animals.
*  And a biology professor from UNAM was watching.
*  And he invited Rodrigo to come out with him into the field.
*  So little Rodrigo ends up going out with scientists to study all kinds of animals.
*  And eventually one of them takes him into a cave.
*  And this is when Rodrigo Medellin holds his very first bat.
*  He told us that the moment shook him inside and he suddenly understood why he was here
*  on earth to protect and advocate for bats, which is what he's been doing ever since.
*  So originally the image of bats was positive.
*  According to Rodrigo, bats are not only not disgusting or dangerous, they are beautiful
*  and smart.
*  And because they play a crucial role in pest control and pollinating and dispersing seeds,
*  they're also good for the world.
*  But then something happened that made it negative.
*  Basically they're just victims of bad PR.
*  Which is an amazing novel.
*  You know, Dracula and vampires and stuff.
*  It's an unfair world.
*  Seriously.
*  And it really is an unfair world.
*  Like many animals on earth right now, bats are in trouble.
*  Not only for the usual reasons like habitat loss and climate change, but for special problems
*  all their own.
*  There are devastating diseases and they get annihilated by the big turbines at wind farms.
*  And there's also this issue of the bad PR.
*  People like me are afraid of bats because of the whole flappy spooky bitty thing, which
*  is then used as an excuse to do all kinds of violent horrible things to them.
*  People poison them or seal them up in caves or even burn them alive.
*  But it wasn't always this way.
*  Especially not here in the Yucatan.
*  In the culture of the Maya, this ancient civilization that thrived here for thousands of years,
*  bats are everywhere.
*  In stories and paintings, they even had a month called Zots.
*  And in Maya mythology, bats represent a living link between our world and the underworld.
*  Death basically.
*  The Maya called the underworld Shibalba, or the place of fear, which if you ask me, bats
*  are a perfect mascot for a place like that.
*  Okay.
*  Huh.
*  All right.
*  So we're doing this show about animals and every animal we've gone to has been something
*  that I love and feel drawn to.
*  And the bat is the first that I'm not drawn to that I scream and I run away from.
*  You are not going to run away from bats after we're done in this trip.
*  Okay.
*  I'm open to it.
*  Oh, I'll convert you.
*  I'm absolutely convinced of that conversion story.
*  Okay, let's try.
*  All right.
*  Let's go.
*  Muchas gracias for the breakfast.
*  Gracias, señor.
*  Gracias.
*  Even the potholes have potholes.
*  Alan and Caitlin and I follow Rodrigo and his students down the most potholy road I've
*  ever been on.
*  It's the underworld trying to open up into the jungle, which is just overwhelmingly dense.
*  It's like a solid block of trees and vines.
*  And apparently inside of it somewhere is a Maya ruin called El Ormiguero, where bats
*  live.
*  I'm just like a 10 excitement.
*  10 excitement.
*  Well, no, there is like an animal part of me that is screaming and running away right
*  now even as we go there.
*  These are bats that Rodrigo and his team have been studying for years.
*  And today they're going to check up on them, catch them and tag them and record a bunch
*  of data.
*  The temple is magnificent.
*  I've never seen anything like it.
*  It's this crumbling structure built out of white limestone roughly 1500 years ago, covered
*  with ornate carvings.
*  And the front door looks like a giant mouth with huge stone fangs.
*  So when you go inside, it's like you're being swallowed.
*  Rodrigo leads us up these ancient stone steps past a no trespassing sign right to this very
*  dark and intimidating hole in the stone about waist high.
*  I'm putting too close on because the bite of these bats is really something out of the
*  scale.
*  And then Rodrigo and his students get all geared up.
*  They put on headlamps and grab these long handled nets and they stoop down and disappear
*  into the darkness.
*  I'm actually helping hold up a tarp against the opening so the bats can't escape.
*  And after a little while, looking very dusty and sweaty, Rodrigo and his students pop back
*  out.
*  One thing they want to be, I cannot believe that that mother is even flying in here.
*  He's so excited he's out of breath because he's found his bats and he and his students
*  are holding them in these bags, these checkered cloth bags.
*  They look like they're made out of tablecloths from an Italian restaurant and the bags are
*  all swinging and flopping around.
*  And they carry these bags outside the temple back down the steps to where they've set up
*  a little science station out on a folding table.
*  So we're going to process them.
*  But I want to process first and foremost the mother.
*  And he's so excited.
*  He tells us this is a bat he's named Big Mama.
*  She's probably big, and she's probably Big Mama.
*  She knows the drill.
*  Rodrigo grabs one of the squiggling bat bags and very tenderly, he reaches in and he pulls
*  out the first bat.
*  But I'm going to wait.
*  I have to say, even if you are a bat lover, this is a strange looking creature.
*  It's called a woolly false vampire bat.
*  Big teeth, big ears, big eyes, and a big nose leaf.
*  It's got fuzzy brown fur and this sort of tall pig snout called a nose leaf.
*  If they have this nose leaf, that means that they can carry the food in their mouth.
*  Rodrigo told us this is so they can echo locate while their mouths are full.
*  They can fly around with a big rat or a mango in their mouth and still shoot these noises
*  out of their nose leaf so they can fly through the jungle without smashing into trees.
*  So if you look at the nose leaf like that, it's a perfect segment of a parable.
*  It's very directional.
*  It's very easily directed by the bat.
*  The bat team weighs the bat and measures its wingspan and they punch out a little tissue
*  sample from its wing.
*  And Rodrigo puts it back in the bag.
*  And then one by one, he pulls the other bats out of their bags.
*  And the whole time they keep biting the crap out of him.
*  And he does not seem to mind at all.
*  He just loves these bats so much.
*  Is that your blood or its blood?
*  I'm standing at a distance and I'm freaked out but also fascinated.
*  And then, out of one of the bags, Rodrigo pulls out a baby bat.
*  He's a boy.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's so freaking cute.
*  It's fresh and fuzzy.
*  Look at the milk.
*  It has little pink feet in the stomach.
*  And Rodrigo flips it over to show us that you can see through the baby bat's pink belly
*  skin milk in its stomach that it's been nursing from its mother.
*  Because these bats are part of a little family.
*  They're a family of bats.
*  And seeing all this just unlocks my general feeling of love for all animals.
*  These bats suddenly seem vulnerable and out of their element.
*  Let's take them all and put them in the shade in the temple.
*  And so when Rodrigo and his students climb back into that dark hole and put the bats
*  back into their temple, I see the darkness a little differently.
*  It's not only a horrifying void of death.
*  It's also just where the bats are.
*  Big Mama and her fuzzy little family.
*  It's actually not even dark to the bats.
*  I mean, yes, it's littered with bones and guano and severed mouse tails, but it's
*  their home.
*  And I'm kind of curious now.
*  I can almost maybe sort of imagine going in there myself, into the bats world, to see
*  the darkness with my own eyes.
*  Maybe tomorrow.
*  Maybe.
*  Did they miss the turn?
*  No.
*  Was that them?
*  Sam?
*  What's happening?
*  We're on our way to visit another bat roast with Rodrigo at a temple called Okal Weets.
*  And on the drive there, we see a small fire.
*  Where patches of the jungle are being cleared.
*  There's tractors and white dust everywhere.
*  Oh, they cleared a huge amount of trees.
*  And what we're seeing is a gigantic project that's going to change the Yucatan forever.
*  It's called Train Maya.
*  This railroad that will circle the whole peninsula right through the wilderness.
*  Breaking up habitats and supercharging development.
*  The perspective of the people of Shibuhiti.
*  The whole thing is very controversial.
*  Alan told me that it's creating a lot of jobs.
*  It's really helping the Yucatan economy.
*  It's hard to understand from a college perspective.
*  But Rodrigo is worried about the impact of all this on the wildlife here.
*  Especially, of course, the bats.
*  Do you have that fear?
*  Uh oh.
*  My VR doesn't know where he's going.
*  We follow Rodrigo off the main road, deep into the jungle.
*  And then we hike.
*  It's so hot right now.
*  It's like a million and a half degrees.
*  But then we see it.
*  The temple.
*  Six hundred years of abandonment.
*  This one is even more ruined than the first one.
*  There are jungle plants growing right out of the stones.
*  It feels secluded and totally abandoned.
*  It's like we've slipped into some secret back pocket of the universe.
*  This is the temple of Okulritz.
*  And as you can see, a whole wall of the temple is missing.
*  But the bats love it here.
*  It's shadowed.
*  It's protected.
*  It's cool.
*  It's beyond the reach of any predator.
*  So they love it here.
*  We all take turns peeking in there through an old doorway, whispering so we don't bother the bats.
*  OK, I'm going into the bat temple with Alan.
*  The bats are up in a high corner.
*  They're just a cluster of dark shapes hanging upside down against the gray stone.
*  What is this temple?
*  I don't think anybody knows, Sam.
*  Who's here?
*  I don't know.
*  Where are they now?
*  They're dead and gone.
*  I see the ears.
*  Do you think they're echolocating us?
*  I know they're echolocating. Maybe.
*  Oh, look. Those two in the back, on the left here, they're getting very, very close together.
*  They're clinging to each other.
*  I think they love each other.
*  Like we feel an affection, a mammal affection.
*  They're attached to each other and they depend on each other for their survival.
*  Beyond that, I cannot tell you that they love each other.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think I could stand in here while you catch the bats?
*  Yeah.
*  I kind of can't believe I just asked to stay in here.
*  We'll sit you there.
*  Because the bats are calm right now, but once Rodrigo starts trying to catch them,
*  Some of them may land on you.
*  they will not be calm.
*  You okay with that?
*  Seriously?
*  Seriously.
*  And even though I've seen some cute bats now, I am still very afraid of them.
*  Yeah, that's with the test.
*  Is that part of progress? Can we call that progress?
*  That would be incredible.
*  I think just being around Rodrigo and his love for bats, it has made me curious.
*  And that curiosity for this one moment just barely outweighed my fear.
*  If they land on you, just don't move.
*  Don't scream and run?
*  Don't scream and run.
*  No screaming.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Get him off. Get him off.
*  No.
*  Nothing like that.
*  Okay.
*  Rodrigo sits me down on this pile of rubble at the back of the chamber,
*  and the students outside wrap the whole chamber up in tarps so we're sealed in.
*  Even if I wanted to run away screaming, I couldn't.
*  I'm stuck here until Rodrigo is done.
*  And it is dark.
*  It's cool and musty and it smells like ancient stone.
*  Okay.
*  We're ready.
*  But after a minute, my eyes start to adjust,
*  and I can just barely see the bats up in the corner,
*  these dark shapes against the ceiling.
*  I see Rodrigo kind of sneak over and reach up his long net and try to catch a bat.
*  And that's when the motion starts, the bat motion,
*  the flitting and darting, you know, bat stuff.
*  The bats are flying around like nightmare confetti.
*  I'm scared.
*  And I'm just sitting here frozen, trying to stay calm, dissociating.
*  And I found myself thinking weirdly of my father,
*  because I realized I was sitting in this dark bat chamber,
*  and I was wearing my dad's socks, which I inherited when he died.
*  And I remembered this flash of a memory from when I was a kid.
*  It was the first time I ever saw a bat in my life.
*  After my parents got divorced, my dad used to love to take us to caves
*  when he had us for the weekend or something.
*  He would take us on tours or exploring on our own.
*  It was kind of our special place outside of the normal world.
*  And I remembered being maybe five years old and deep in this cave
*  when suddenly there was this motion out of nowhere, and it was bats.
*  And one of them flew so close to my face.
*  And I remembered seeing its teeth and the little pig nose.
*  And the funny thing is, I don't think I was scared,
*  because my father was right there with me.
*  I was just interested.
*  It actually seemed amazing that there was this whole other form of life
*  deep down in the earth, and here we were crossing paths.
*  And now 40 years later, sitting in this dark temple in the Yucatan,
*  I was just kind of swimming in this memory when suddenly I look up,
*  and Rodrigo and his student have caught all the bats.
*  And they're holding their little checkered bags,
*  and the chamber is suddenly unwrapped, and the light comes flooding back in.
*  And we're back in the daylight.
*  And it occurs to me that maybe my fear of bats isn't really about bats.
*  Maybe it's more about what they represent, all the deeper, darker stuff,
*  the unknown, the void, death.
*  You can't shut the door without a tree in it.
*  You want me to go forward a bit?
*  Oh, I'm jungle tired.
*  I'm so tired.
*  And all this bat family talk, and the memories, and socks, and impermanence,
*  it's got me thinking about my family, about my daughter Greta, who's off at college,
*  and my son Beckett, who turned 16 while I was on this trip.
*  And I didn't think it would really bother me not to be there for his birthday,
*  but now it really does.
*  You're a boy. You're a big boy.
*  And Alan can relate because he found out this morning that his baby daughter, Maria, took her first steps.
*  Maria took her first steps.
*  Everything is just rushing forward without us.
*  Those big milestones.
*  I know.
*  I felt a lot of love and distance at the same time.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you going to do? Your boy's all grown up.
*  I don't know.
*  I can't even imagine.
*  I cannot imagine. It sounds...
*  devastating.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, and not joyous and wonderful, and they have their lives, and then they'll come back, and you'll get, like, you know...
*  Yeah, there's all that.
*  There's all that.
*  Yeah, there's like...
*  There's the part where it's an ending, and there's the part where it's just wonderful development.
*  And if it went any different, that would be bad.
*  But, yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  Then you die, and then everyone forgets that you existed, and then you're...
*  And your civilization is a big husk of ruins.
*  Wait, you took it too far.
*  What?
*  I guess. I mean, I guess.
*  I mean, I'm looking at those Mayan temples, and I'm thinking, like, everything dies.
*  Like, the forest, things are dying all around us, and animals are dying, and...
*  You're gonna die, and both of our dads died, and like, everyone is gonna have a dead dad.
*  Like, that's what it means to be alive, is that eventually you have a dead dad.
*  Yeah.
*  Unless you die first. But then there's the fact that it was like individual...
*  My individual dad, Peter Anderson, had died.
*  And I have to sit around thinking about that all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  Because he was my individual dad.
*  Do you think about it a lot?
*  I think about him every day.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  He was a really affectionate, sweet, kind man.
*  Um...
*  I took a bunch of his clothes after he died, and so I'm always wearing his socks, or his raincoat, or...
*  His fingerless gloves all winter long, and all kinds of stuff.
*  That's curious.
*  I think about him every day.
*  We drive on through the jungle, toward our last stop with Rodrigo.
*  A very special place that the Bat Team has told us is gonna blow our minds.
*  And it's basically the last place I could have imagined myself going to before this trip.
*  We are 43 minutes away.
*  Because even the name of this place sounds like a horror movie.
*  It's called the Bat Volcano.
*  And...
*  He's afraid of certain things.
*  And we are going there after the break.
*  Uh...
*  Did you use robbers? Robbers robbing you?
*  Yeah.
*  Why are you not afraid of robbers?
*  I'm afraid of robbers.
*  I already think that robbers are the biggest men in the world.
*  Let me tell you a story about a hole.
*  A deep, dark, intimidating hole in the earth, in the Yucatan.
*  Where thousands of years ago the limestone collapsed,
*  leaving this big canyon with a cave at the bottom.
*  They call it the Bat Volcano.
*  Welcome guys.
*  Thank you.
*  So stay on this side of the rope.
*  Because every time you come here, you're gonna see a cave.
*  Stay on this side of the rope.
*  Because every night, millions of bats erupt out of this hole to fly off into the darkness.
*  Tell me what we're looking at.
*  We're looking at a gaping maw in the center of the earth.
*  Yeah, we're looking into the throat of planet Earth.
*  How far down does it go?
*  Hard to tell the scale of it is so big. A few hundred feet?
*  Rodrigo insisted that we see the Bat Volcano.
*  Ten miles? I don't know.
*  He wanted us to feel not just what it's like to see a few bats, or a family of bats,
*  but to be completely outnumbered, fully immersed in bats.
*  Plus, there's a whole crowd of other people, because this place is kind of a tourist attraction.
*  Like 30 meters long, 6 meters high.
*  It's still light outside, so nothing has started yet.
*  We're just staring down, waiting.
*  I think this is going to be impressive.
*  It feels like the bat capacity for this cave is large.
*  And then the sky clouds over, and it starts to rain on us.
*  A real tropical downpour.
*  There's no shelter, so we're just standing there getting soaked.
*  And I ask Rodrigo, is the rain going to stop the bats from flying?
*  And he says, absolutely nothing will stop these bats from flying.
*  So we stand there, sopping wet, waiting.
*  Oh, there we go.
*  And finally we see the tiniest little flitting in this giant bowl of the canyon.
*  It's almost nothing, just a speck of motion.
*  And then a couple more specks.
*  And then a few more.
*  It's thickening.
*  It's sort of like watching popcorn pop.
*  Getting really close.
*  There's like one kernel, and then two, and then all of a sudden a million kernels.
*  But these are bats, just infinite bats coming out.
*  Different sizes, different species.
*  But they're all sort of moving together like this huge superorganism.
*  Oh my god.
*  They're just really getting thicker and thicker over on that side.
*  And soon the whole universe is bats.
*  It's really hypnotic.
*  I feel completely dwarfed.
*  They're coming really close to my head.
*  And in that moment I feel the strangest feeling.
*  Do you feel scared?
*  Uh-uh.
*  You feel scared?
*  It's absolutely not, because it's extremely delicate and beautiful.
*  It's really beautiful.
*  I feel soothed by the bats.
*  I'm not scared at all.
*  Bats are passing right in front of my face, through my legs.
*  They're shooting through the tiny space between me and Alan.
*  And there's a crowd of people around us watching, and we are all completely silent.
*  There's this reverence in the air.
*  Cover your eyes.
*  I don't know how many thousands, or tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of bats flew right by me that night, within arm's reach.
*  None of these bats ever came close to touching me.
*  But I could feel their attention on me.
*  And I felt this absolute sense of trust.
*  All I had to do was stand there and watch.
*  And these millions of bat wings flapping, it sounded like rain.
*  Which reminded me of Oregon, where I'm from.
*  Where my dad lived.
*  And then, out of the silence, I hear a tiny voice calling out.
*  A little girl calling for her papa.
*  Which is what I called my dad. Papa.
*  Papa.
*  And I thought about all the bats we'd seen.
*  And the bat families.
*  Holding each other.
*  Huddling together close.
*  Hanging from the ceiling like a bunch of bananas.
*  Nothing, nothing.
*  Beautiful.
*  Beautiful.
*  I'm so glad that we enjoyed it.
*  So profound and beautiful.
*  And then I thought how, in my own tiny life.
*  Surrounded by all this depth and darkness that I'll never understand.
*  All I really want to do, while I'm still here.
*  Is just hang like a bunch of bananas.
*  Close to all of the creatures that I love.
*  My friend Alan.
*  My little family.
*  Walnut.
*  Until one of these days.
*  Maybe soon.
*  Maybe a long time from now.
*  The darkness will take me.
*  And I will spread my wings and fly off into some other world that I don't understand.
*  And at least at this moment.
*  Standing on the edge of this giant hole.
*  Immersed in this living cloud of bats.
*  That actually sounds.
*  Just fine.

*  D.H. Lawrence also wrote a poem about mosquitoes.
*  He did.
*  Do you remember how that one goes?
*  He doesn't say not for me.
*  He likes mosquitoes better than bats.
*  I think so.
