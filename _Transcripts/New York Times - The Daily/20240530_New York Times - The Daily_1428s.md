# The Government Takes On Ticketmaster
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlzkEpbfLj8)
*  Hi everybody, it's Sabrina.
*  Before we start today, we wanted to invite you to something special.
*  The Tribeca Festival is starting a brand new annual gala to celebrate excellence in audio.
*  For this, the inaugural year, they've chosen to celebrate the daily.
*  We know you, our incredible audience, live all over the world, but we'd like to invite
*  you to join us.
*  The gala is in New York on June 9th at 5pm.
*  You can get all the details and buy tickets at tribecafilm.com slash the daily.
*  That's tribecafilm.com slash the daily.
*  I'll be there, Michael too, along with a bunch of us from the show.
*  Mo Rocca is going to host it.
*  So if you're in the area or you're visiting, we'd love to see you there.
*  Okay, on with today's show.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernese, and this is the daily.
*  I have got a bone to pick, as usual, with Ticketmaster.
*  The biggest problem that I have right now is not getting tickets to the air tour.
*  Loading, loading, loading.
*  One I'm so bad, one I'm so bad, one I'm so bad.
*  Oh, no.
*  I looked at my account and the tickets are gone.
*  Over the past few years, few companies have provoked as much anger.
*  I cannot afford $1,500 tickets.
*  Among music fans.
*  Oh my God.
*  As Ticketmaster.
*  I literally hate Ticketmaster.
*  Like, there is no company.
*  I think I hate more than Ticketmaster.
*  Ticketmaster ought to look in the mirror and say, I'm the problem.
*  It's me.
*  Last week, the Department of Justice announced it was taking the company to court.
*  Today, my colleague, David McCabe, on how the government's case could reshape America's
*  multi-billion dollar live music industry.
*  It's Thursday, May 30th.
*  So David, good to have you back.
*  You have become a beloved guest at the Daily because the government keeps bringing these
*  huge antitrust cases and we keep turning to you to explain them.
*  Well, it's a pleasure to be back.
*  And today I have a question for you, which is, what was the first concert you ever went
*  to?
*  Oh my gosh, the first concert I ever went to.
*  Oh my God, I think it was Van Halen in the 1980s, which maybe is before you were born.
*  You know, no comment, but that's a pretty good first concert.
*  And the case that we're here to talk about today is actually all about shows like a Van
*  Halen concert in 1980.
*  Okay, I'm ready.
*  So let's get into it.
*  This case, as you and I both know, is about Ticketmaster.
*  So tell us about this case.
*  So anyone who attends concerts regularly or even irregularly probably knows about Ticketmaster.
*  It's kind of the ubiquitous digital box office.
*  And those people are probably also familiar with the ubiquitous fan complaints about Ticketmaster,
*  that the company puts high fees that they don't entirely explain onto tickets, that
*  tickets will sell out really fast during these sort of frantic pre-sales for tours, and that
*  the website doesn't always work very well.
*  And probably the most infamous Ticketmaster incident in recent memory was a couple of
*  years ago when the pre-sale began for Taylor Swift's massive Iris tour, and fans got locked
*  out, couldn't get tickets, and were absolutely furious.
*  And it really put in the spotlight the power of this company over the ability to buy a
*  ticket to a live music event.
*  So the DOJ is pointing the finger at this company for all this consumer angst, at Ticketmaster.
*  Well, and when you say this company, it's not just Ticketmaster.
*  It's the company that owns Ticketmaster, a company called Live Nation Entertainment,
*  we'll say Live Nation for short.
*  And it's a giant company.
*  And to think about just how gigantic and how expansive Live Nation is, I think it's helpful
*  to think about the fan experience of going to a concert.
*  It starts with buying a ticket.
*  And maybe you buy a group of tickets for you and your friends.
*  And then one of your friends can't make it, they got other plans, you resell their tickets
*  so you can make your money back.
*  And then the day of the show, you go, it's this big production.
*  It's at a venue, someone has booked the artist to appear, you go, you buy a beer, you have
*  a good time.
*  Live Nation is involved in many parts of that process.
*  And that starts with being a major concert promoter.
*  They're the one putting it on, arranging the event.
*  They're also selling the tickets through Ticketmaster.
*  Sometimes they're also involved in reselling the tickets when your friend can't make it.
*  And not only that, they actually sometimes manage the artists and they own or operate
*  the venues where the show is happening.
*  So even down to that beer you're drinking to enjoy it with the show, they might be involved
*  in picking the person who sells that beer to you.
*  So basically, they're everywhere.
*  They're everywhere and the Justice Department says that's a big part of the problem, that
*  its power is bad for fans.
*  Good morning.
*  Earlier today, the Department of Justice...
*  And we really heard that come through at the press conference last week that the Justice
*  Department held to announce this case.
*  People always remember the first time that they were transformed by live music.
*  Senator Merrick Garland, the Attorney General, really personalized this issue.
*  I still remember as a senior in college going to a Bonnie Raitt concert and seeing...
*  He told this story about going to a Bonnie Raitt concert in college.
*  Merrick Garland did?
*  Yeah, Merrick Garland did.
*  I don't think of Merrick Garland and Bonnie Raitt together in the same sentence.
*  Well, apparently in college he attended a Bonnie Raitt show and the thing he highlighted
*  was that the opener was a young Bruce Springsteen.
*  We all know that we had just seen the future of rock and roll.
*  And in that story, the Attorney General seems to be getting at two important threads of
*  this case.
*  The first is that concerts are formative for the people who attend them.
*  And the second is that concerts are an important way that artists reach their fans, that young
*  Bruce Springsteen went on to now be one of the biggest touring artists in the world.
*  The Justice Department filed this lawsuit on behalf of fans who should be able to go
*  to concerts without a monopoly standing in their way.
*  We have filed this lawsuit on behalf of artists who should be able to...
*  And so the Justice Department is responding here to a feeling that Live Nation, this giant
*  company, has become a gatekeeper for both artists and fans and that has allowed it to
*  pay artists less sometimes, but also charge fans those fees that they're so mad about.
*  It is time for fans and artists to stop paying the price for Live Nation's monopoly.
*  Thank you.
*  So help us understand how things have gotten to this point where Live Nation is so powerful
*  that the DOJ feels the need to sue them.
*  Well, this company has a long history of tangling with the Justice Department.
*  And that really starts in 2009 when Live Nation and Ticketmaster announced that they were
*  going to merge.
*  This merger, this big corporate deal, will marry Live Nation's concert promotion business,
*  the business of putting on shows, with Ticketmaster's experience as an online ticketing platform.
*  And the Justice Department, a big part of its job is looking at corporate mergers to
*  figure out if they will substantially lessen competition in the economy.
*  So the Justice Department reviews this merger.
*  In 2010, decides we will let this merger go through, but we do have some concerns that
*  it might reduce competition in the industry of ticketing.
*  And so we're going to reach a legal settlement with Live Nation and Ticketmaster that puts
*  conditions on the deal that requires the company to sell some assets to kind of lessen its
*  footprint.
*  And so the merger goes through and that creates the sort of modern day Live Nation-Ticketmaster
*  combination.
*  So the government ultimately actually just lets it happen.
*  That's right.
*  They put conditions on the merger, but ultimately they let it go through.
*  And the company continues to tangle with the Justice Department over the next 15 or so
*  years, but mostly they keep getting bigger.
*  They keep growing their footprint across this ecosystem that creates some of the biggest
*  concert tours in the country.
*  So just how big has the company actually become?
*  Give me some numbers.
*  Well, let's start here.
*  Every year they sell about 600 million tickets.
*  600 million tickets?
*  That's more than the number of people in the United States of America.
*  Yeah, and that is a global number, but it's a lot of tickets, right?
*  The Department of Justice estimates that in the United States, Live Nation controls about
*  80% of ticketing to major venue concerts.
*  Wow.
*  So that's a big percentage.
*  They also own or control like in excess of 250 venues, including a big percentage, the
*  Justice Department says, of major amphitheaters, the kind of big outdoor concert venues that
*  are ultimately kind of in between a nightclub and the size of like a big football stadium.
*  And they manage hundreds of artists.
*  They have this direct relationship with artists.
*  And so this company is wide and it is deep into this industry.
*  So ultimately, the Justice Department says that, and I'm going to quote here, it's the
*  quote, gatekeeper for delivery of nearly all live music in America today.
*  OK, it's big.
*  But as we know from other DOJ cases, and this is something that you have taught me, David,
*  the cases against Apple and Google, just being big is not in and of itself a problem.
*  That's right.
*  Where companies run afoul of the law is when they use their power as a monopoly against
*  their competitors in order to stay powerful or get more powerful.
*  And the Justice Department says that Live Nation has built a complex machine to do just that.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So what does the DOJ say that Live Nation is able to do because it is so big?
*  How does it use its bigness?
*  So the most prominent allegation is that Live Nation uses its power as a concert promoter
*  to entrench its power in ticketing.
*  As a reminder, when you put together a concert, a promoter works with an artist to book the
*  show.
*  They book the show at a venue and that venue for all of its shows has to choose a ticketing
*  provider, right?
*  A digital box office where people can buy their way into the shows.
*  And what the Justice Department is arguing here is that Live Nation is able to wield
*  its big artists, the tours that it promotes, as a cudgel to force venues to use Ticketmaster,
*  its ticketing service.
*  So the Justice Department says that in an instance in which a venue switched away from
*  using Ticketmaster, that Live Nation routed tours around that venue, which of course means
*  less money for that venue and a problem for their business.
*  Interesting.
*  So basically, Live Nation saying, look, if you want Taylor Swift in your little amphitheater
*  over there, you're going to have to use Ticketmaster.
*  It's Ticketmaster or no Taylor Swift.
*  That is effectively the behavior the Justice Department is arguing has happened here.
*  They're saying that Live Nation does this in veiled ways and that more importantly,
*  it's really understood by venues throughout the industry that if you don't use Ticketmaster,
*  you really risk out on losing important Live Nation managed tours.
*  And that once these venues do choose Ticketmaster, Live Nation locks them into these long exclusive
*  ticketing contracts, which can last for as long as 14 years.
*  14 years?
*  That's pretty long.
*  What else is DOJ alleging that Live Nation has done?
*  Another thing the Justice Department says that Live Nation does is use its power as
*  an owner of venues to get away with paying artists less money for their tours.
*  So how does that work?
*  Well, actually the argument is that because Live Nation controls so many of certain types
*  of venues, that there are instances in which an artist tour might largely be dominated
*  by Live Nation-owned venues.
*  And the Justice Department is saying that Live Nation knows that artists don't have
*  a lot of other options for where to play their concerts and as a result is able to pay those
*  artists less because there's not competitive pressure when they're booking those tours.
*  Pretty unfair to artists who would really benefit from other venues owned by other
*  people competing for them.
*  And that's exactly what the Justice Department is saying that artists lose out, not just
*  fans.
*  And there's a striking story in the complaint that I think crystallizes how the Justice
*  Department sees these streams of power coming together.
*  And it concerns a concert, which the lawsuit doesn't name, in 2021.
*  My colleague Ben Cesario has reported that it was a Kanye West concert featuring Drake.
*  It was a benefit show and it was taking place at the LA Coliseum in Los Angeles.
*  One of the companies involved in putting on this show was a firm called TEG.
*  They do promotion and ticketing of the kind that Live Nation does.
*  And the government says that Live Nation saw this as a threat, that they saw this company,
*  TEG, involved in this show and they were worried about what it would mean for them.
*  And that they then undertook steps to put pressure on TEG and make their life difficult
*  in a couple ways.
*  The first was that TEG had reached a deal to sell some tickets, according to the complaint,
*  through StubHub.
*  StubHub, it's a secondary resale market.
*  You know, you can buy tickets to shows when people aren't going to use them.
*  Right.
*  And competitor to Ticketmaster, right?
*  And competitor to Ticketmaster.
*  And the Justice Department says that Live Nation found out about that and said, well,
*  we have the exclusive ticketing contract for this venue.
*  And so we will make sure that if you bought your ticket on StubHub, you won't be allowed
*  to come into this show.
*  Really?
*  Like they couldn't come into the concert?
*  Well, and ultimately, the complaint says that StubHub had to work with Ticketmaster to fulfill
*  the tickets that had already been sold, they stopped selling new tickets, and that hundreds
*  of people who bought their tickets on StubHub didn't get into the show.
*  That seems very unfair.
*  Like they bought a ticket.
*  Well, and according to the Justice Department, it didn't stop there.
*  That Live Nation used its industry connections to pressure an investor in TEG, this company
*  that it viewed as a threat.
*  And that it pushed that investor to pull back from its relationship with TEG, which obviously
*  would have weakened this potential competitor.
*  So these are very strong armed tactics.
*  What is the DOJ saying is the result of all of this?
*  Like what does all of this amount to?
*  It says that all of this adds up to higher fees for consumers and a worse product, a
*  worse quality ticketing experience when fans go to buy because Live Nation doesn't have
*  to compete with anyone.
*  It doesn't have to innovate in response to competitors.
*  So among other things, the Justice Department wants to break this company up at the very
*  least by separating Ticketmaster, the ticketing unit, the box office unit from the rest of
*  Live Nation that does all these other things, promotes concerts, owns venues, etc.
*  So in other words, go back to the way it was in the beginning.
*  Yeah, or as much as you can.
*  And why does that fix the problem?
*  Well, the Justice Department doesn't say a lot on this point, but it's clear that what
*  they want to do with this lawsuit is disrupt this cycle where Live Nation's power reinforces
*  itself again and again and again.
*  And what does Live Nation say in response?
*  I imagine they disagree with all of this.
*  They do.
*  They've said a lot.
*  And they start out by saying something that will be familiar to you because other companies
*  that have been accused of antitrust violations say it as well, which is that they don't fit
*  the profile of a monopoly.
*  That their overall profit margins are lower than those of companies like Meta or Apple
*  or Google.
*  And that even if you look at Ticketmaster specifically, they take a smaller percentage
*  of every sale than a lot of other digital platforms.
*  So they say basically the numbers show that we don't have the kind of power you would
*  normally associate with a monopoly.
*  And then they say, listen, we know that there are things that fans don't like about the
*  ticketing experience.
*  There may be fixes to those, but largely it's not Live Nation's fault, they say.
*  They say that artists generally set the prices they want people to pay for tickets.
*  Really?
*  So artists themselves do it?
*  Right.
*  That artists sign off on how much a ticket will cost to their shows.
*  And they also say that demand sometimes drives ticket prices up.
*  If there are more people who want to see a show than there are seats or standing room
*  to see that show, the prices will be higher.
*  And finally, they say that there's this kind of pernicious outside force of scalpers, people
*  who resell tickets that use bots to hoover up way more tickets than they could possibly
*  use and then resell them at a higher price.
*  And so they say that all these things may contribute to a fan experience that people
*  don't like, but that it's not necessarily Live Nation's fault.
*  I mean, to me, this makes certain sense.
*  Because I guess if you think of a Taylor Swift show and lots of people trying to buy
*  tickets, one reason why those tickets are expensive is not necessarily because there's
*  something nefarious going on, but because lots of people want to buy tickets and there's
*  a market and supply and demand has a role here.
*  Well, and a clear question here that I have that other people have asked is, how much
*  does the Justice Department think ticket prices have gone up because of this alleged Live
*  Nation monopoly?
*  And the Justice Department hasn't answered that question.
*  They haven't disentangled it with all of the other stuff that's around.
*  Market forces, everything.
*  That's right.
*  And there's another element of Live Nation's response that we should mention, which is
*  that the company basically says this lawsuit is politically motivated, that this administration,
*  the Biden administration, is bringing lawsuits that don't hold a lot of water, but are anti-business.
*  That's what Live Nation is saying.
*  I mean, it does sort of ring true in some sense, right?
*  This has been the tilt of this administration toward cracking down on big companies.
*  The DOJ has changed in this respect.
*  They're filing a lawsuit to break up a merger that a previous DOJ had actually approved.
*  Well, you're right.
*  This Department of Justice, this administration more broadly, has a different view about antitrust.
*  They think that antitrust law can be a more expansive tool to address problems in the
*  economy.
*  They've put that into practice.
*  They've sued Google for violating anti-monopoly laws.
*  They've sued Apple for violating anti-monopoly laws.
*  But I think ultimately what they believe is that they're responding to a change in the
*  economy, that these companies have gotten much bigger, that they have gotten more powerful,
*  and they are responding to the way the companies broke the law on their way to becoming that
*  big.
*  So, David, when you and I talked about Google and Apple, you referenced them here, we talked
*  about how there were broad repercussions for the future on American society.
*  What would you say the implications are in this case?
*  This case, ultimately, for the Justice Department, is about the market for culture and creativity.
*  You know, a few years ago, the Justice Department successfully blocked Penguin Random House,
*  a big publisher, from buying Simon & Schuster, another publisher.
*  They said that one problem with this merger was that it would reduce how much authors
*  got paid, and that it would create a market where fewer books and fewer types of stories
*  broke through.
*  This Justice Department is embracing an idea that the more concentrated the economy gets,
*  the more it stifles creative expression, the ability of artists to make art and get it
*  to the public, and the ability of the public to consume it.
*  And that, they say, is a central question of democracy.
*  Because things like music are how we talk about big social issues or big political issues.
*  So that is, they say, what's at the heart of this case, that it is not just about the
*  fees, it's not just about how much an artist gets paid, but it's about whether or not there
*  is a fair marketplace for ideas, and whether or not consumers are able to access it.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito declined to recuse himself from two
*  cases arising from the January 6th, 2021 attack on the Capitol after The Times reported
*  that flags displayed outside his houses appeared to support the Stop the Steal movement.
*  In letters to Democratic members of Congress who had demanded his recusal, Justice Alito
*  said that the flags at his home in Virginia and a beach house in New Jersey were flown
*  by his wife, Martha Ann, and that he had had nothing to do with it.
*  And a group of 12 New York jurors deliberated for more than four hours in the final stretch
*  of the criminal trial of Donald Trump, in which the former president is accused of falsifying
*  business records.
*  The jurors asked for portions of the testimony from two witnesses to be read back to them,
*  as well as the judge's instructions.
*  They were then dismissed for the day and will resume deliberations today.
*  Today's episode was produced by Will Reed, Rob Zipko, and Michelle Bonja.
*  It was edited by Michael Benoit and Brendan Klinkenberg, contains original music by Marian
*  Lozano, Dan Powell, and Will Reed, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  See you tomorrow.
