# Inside a Trump ICE Raid
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Natalie Cantroweth. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=3.92s)]
*  This week's protests and clashes in California are the biggest flare-up yet over Trump's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=11.92s)]
*  immigration enforcement. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=16.72s)]
*  They follow months of escalating ICE raids and rhetoric as the administration struggles [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  to fulfill the president's big promises for mass deportation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=23.72s)]
*  Today, my colleague Hamid Ali-Aziz goes inside one ICE operation and explains why the tensions [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=29.52s)]
*  over Trump's aggressive approach may only get worse in the months to come. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=36.08s)]
*  It's Wednesday, June 11th. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Hamid, welcome back to the show. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=54.96s)]
*  We've now seen five days of protests in LA over these ICE raids. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=57.32s)]
*  First, the administration sent in the National Guard, then hundreds of Marines. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=61.52s)]
*  All of this comes after months of increasing enforcement across the country, ICE showing [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=67.12s)]
*  up in full force to find and detain immigrants in various cities. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=72.12s)]
*  As one of the people who's been leading our coverage of this, what do you feel like is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=77.56s)]
*  the story of what we're seeing here? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=82.6s)]
*  To me, what happened in LA is a sign that the administration means what they've been [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  saying. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  They plan on going into every community in the United States to find people they believe [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  should be deported. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=98.04s)]
*  That includes Los Angeles. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=99.76s)]
*  That includes downtown Los Angeles, California, a place that has been basically the center [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  of resistance to President Trump's immigration crackdown. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=108.0s)]
*  They are not afraid of going into these communities and making arrests. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=112.08s)]
*  But I think it also speaks to the fact that ICE has really been struggling to get their [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  immigration arrests up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=121.84s)]
*  Of course, President Trump came into office promising this historic mass deportation effort [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=124.2s)]
*  that he was going to deport more people than ever before. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=132.24s)]
*  Right, the largest mass deportation operation in history. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=135.04s)]
*  Exactly, and thus far that's been really slow going. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=138.44s)]
*  Slow going how? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  How do we see that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=143.56s)]
*  Well, from the beginning of the administration until earlier this week, they have deported [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=144.56s)]
*  around 200,000 people. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=151.16s)]
*  And for comparison, during the Biden administration in 2024, they deported over 700,000 people. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=153.88s)]
*  Wow, so this is a lot less. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  So I think at this point, they're on track for over 500,000 deportations over the course [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=164.92s)]
*  of the entire year, which is not really mass deportation in the way that President Trump [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=170.48s)]
*  promised it on the campaign trail last year. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=176.27999999999997s)]
*  Hamid, it certainly doesn't seem like they're failing on this measure for lack of trying. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=178.92s)]
*  They're obviously putting in a real effort here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=184.2s)]
*  So what's going on behind the scenes? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  What's making this so hard for them? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=189.32s)]
*  Well, every part of deportation is really hard. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=192.24s)]
*  So getting travel documents from countries, getting countries to accept their people, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=196.6s)]
*  getting enough planes to put people on to deport them to foreign countries, getting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=202.96s)]
*  enough detention to hold people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=208.12s)]
*  And in the past, ISIS really relied on jails and prisons to get their numbers. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=211.0s)]
*  That has been the bread and butter of ISIS going to jails, picking up people and arresting [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=215.28s)]
*  them and deporting them very quickly. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  But now so many American communities are turning back from cooperating with ICE. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=224.16s)]
*  So at every step of the way, they're running into logistics and resource challenges. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=230.04s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=235.44s)]
*  So just a bunch of obstacles here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=236.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=238.6s)]
*  But there's something else going on as well, which is that the Trump administration has [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=239.68s)]
*  been incredibly successful at lowering the number of people crossing the southern border. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=243.36s)]
*  They've essentially blocked asylum at the southern border. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=248.96s)]
*  They've told people they're going to turn them back immediately. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  There's no access to asylum protections in the United States. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  And because of that, less people are crossing the border. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=259.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the numbers are historically low. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=261.44s)]
*  But those numbers mean that you can't get your deportation numbers up because during [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  the Biden administration, during the Obama administration, deportations at the southern [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=269.8s)]
*  border were a big part of the deportation numbers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  So the Trump administration no longer has that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=278.56s)]
*  It's like in a way, their success at the southern border makes this other goal of mass deportations [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=281.64s)]
*  a lot harder to achieve. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=287.36s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=290.2s)]
*  Everyone is being thrown at doing immigration enforcement in the United States. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=292.2s)]
*  He's in the Department of Justice, including the FBI, ATF, DEA, the US Marshals, along [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=296.92s)]
*  with agents and officers at ICE. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=304.36s)]
*  But they're not meeting the levels of enforcement that the White House and this administration [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=307.40000000000003s)]
*  wants. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=312.92s)]
*  I mean, Tom Homan has said publicly that ICE has done a lot, but they need to do more, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=313.92s)]
*  that he's not satisfied with what they've done already. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=318.32s)]
*  And that's what's happening publicly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=321.04s)]
*  But that pressure is manifesting even inside ICE headquarters. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=323.12s)]
*  Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff, one of the most senior individuals in the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=328.12s)]
*  Trump administration, went to ICE headquarters himself and met with top ICE senior leaders [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=333.48s)]
*  and walked them through what this administration wants when it comes to arrests and deportations. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=339.36s)]
*  I had one source with knowledge of this meeting say that Stephen Miller was asking who thinks [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=345.08s)]
*  we can get to a million deportations this year? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=350.2s)]
*  Can we hit 1000, 2000, 3000 arrests a day? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=353.92s)]
*  A quota, right? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=357.36s)]
*  I mean, is your understanding that Miller was essentially asking them, look, hit this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=358.36s)]
*  number? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=363.0s)]
*  We actually spoke with someone in that room who said that, hey, you know, he wasn't throwing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=364.0s)]
*  out a quota for us, but... [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  Under President Trump's leadership, we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3000 [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=371.68s)]
*  arrests for ICE every day. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=379.64s)]
*  Then Miller goes on Fox News soon after and actually puts that quota out there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=381.36s)]
*  He says it publicly, a minimum 3000 arrests a day. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  And President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=389.52s)]
*  single day so we can get... [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=394.4s)]
*  I mean, this is unseen. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=396.52s)]
*  This is unheard of before at ICE to hit 3000 arrests a day. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=398.08s)]
*  That's a level they've never hit. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=402.4s)]
*  They haven't come close to hitting. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=404.84s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=406.12s)]
*  And he's putting this out publicly. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=407.12s)]
*  This number really kind of permeated throughout the agency. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=408.74s)]
*  Everybody has become aware of this target, this goal of 3000 arrests a day. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=412.70000000000005s)]
*  So this message has become heard loud and clear across ICE. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=416.74s)]
*  So they're getting really extraordinary pressure for really high numbers at the same time that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=421.14000000000004s)]
*  all of the easier avenues that they might take for deportations have just been cut off, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  right? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=431.62s)]
*  At the border, it's basically shut down. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=432.62s)]
*  And as you said, many cities won't let ICE into local jails. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=434.34000000000003s)]
*  I imagine this has left officers feeling like, how are we going to ramp things up? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=438.32s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=445.96s)]
*  And we're seeing things that we've never seen before, like ICE showing up to immigration [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=446.96s)]
*  courthouses and actually waiting for immigrants to walk out of their hearings to pick them [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=452.67999999999995s)]
*  up, arrest them, and try to deport them as quickly as possible. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=458.64s)]
*  But it's one thing to report on these policies and to hear about this ramped up enforcement [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=464.76000000000005s)]
*  from across the country, and it's another to actually see it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=471.48s)]
*  So I really wanted to go on the ground and see what it was like to be with ICE officers, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=478.0s)]
*  with FBI agents, with DEA agents, when ICE goes into American communities and tries to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=486.0s)]
*  arrest as many people as they possibly can. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=492.24s)]
*  So actually, a week after that meeting with Stephen Miller at ICE headquarters in Washington, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  D.C., I was actually able to go on an ICE operation in Miami, Florida with a top official [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=502.88000000000005s)]
*  from the agency. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=510.6s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=511.6s)]
*  OK, Hamid, you said you got invited by ICE to go on this raid. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=535.2s)]
*  You go to Florida. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=538.96s)]
*  Take me through what you saw. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=540.4s)]
*  So most ICE operations start really early in the day, and this one was no different. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=542.84s)]
*  Yo, good morning. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=548.32s)]
*  How's it going? Good. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=550.12s)]
*  I need coffee. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=551.28s)]
*  Daily producer Carlos Prieto and I woke up quite early, around 430, and we headed out [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=553.8s)]
*  to a parking lot next to a U.S. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=561.6s)]
*  bank in Miami, Florida. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=565.44s)]
*  So we're at this parking lot. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=568.72s)]
*  There's about a dozen, maybe 15 officers, most of them wearing tactical gear. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=570.72s)]
*  And when we arrived, we saw that there was a group of federal agents, of course, ICE [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=576.4s)]
*  agents, but there were also people there from the FBI. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=582.0s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=586.72s)]
*  Thanks for coming out on this beautiful Wednesday morning. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=587.84s)]
*  And every morning after the individual, his name is Yerlin Nsuala Rivera. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  And it was there where we learned that the first target, in fact, was an individual who [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  had allegedly been arrested for sexual battery on a minor. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=602.0s)]
*  This is the first person they're trying to arrest that day. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=612.72s)]
*  It's also just like important to note the fact that this message of deporting people [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=613.2s)]
*  have been convicted of crimes so heinous that would make people so fearful to be their [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=618.4000000000001s)]
*  neighbors really has been the through line and the messaging from this administration. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=624.48s)]
*  So I think it's important to note the fact that they were bringing me along for this [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=630.32s)]
*  ride along. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=634.16s)]
*  This is the first target that perhaps falls in line with that messaging. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=635.04s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=638.96s)]
*  Everybody's in? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=641.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=642.96s)]
*  Got everybody? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=643.84s)]
*  So we got into the car with a senior ICE official, the number two in command of ICE [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=645.12s)]
*  deportation efforts in Washington, D.C., Garrett Ripa. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=651.52s)]
*  And we were riding along with him to this working class neighborhood in Miami, Florida. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=655.52s)]
*  I'm right behind you. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=661.36s)]
*  So which apartment complex? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=662.0s)]
*  What are we? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  Which one are we looking at? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=663.4399999999999s)]
*  So Black City is in front of the house right now on the street. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=664.56s)]
*  I don't know if you can see it from your angle. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=667.36s)]
*  I don't think I can. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=668.96s)]
*  We got to the neighborhood. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=669.92s)]
*  We parked several houses away from the house that was targeted. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=671.12s)]
*  And we were supposed to wait for them to come out of their home and head on their way to work. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=676.48s)]
*  We're moving in on them. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=681.52s)]
*  OK. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=682.72s)]
*  And within a few minutes, that's him. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=684.24s)]
*  He's up there. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  They had actually arrested their target. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=688.96s)]
*  So they just put the guy in the back of a van and now they're checking a, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=692.64s)]
*  what I suspect is his car, a blue Honda Civic. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=697.68s)]
*  And at that point, I kind of thought maybe, you know, that was it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=700.56s)]
*  But we're from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=703.52s)]
*  We're just going to run your history. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=707.28s)]
*  I have a brother. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=709.84s)]
*  The target's brother was sitting in a car and surrounded by these ICE officials. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=712.4s)]
*  So you apply for asylum when you're going through the proceedings. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=718.96s)]
*  That's what he's telling you? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=722.08s)]
*  Do you have a court date? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=724.24s)]
*  Walking through his status, walking through when he came to the United States. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=726.88s)]
*  And at some point, the call was made. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  They cuffed him and they let him into the same van that his brother was in. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=735.76s)]
*  And to be clear, this guy was not an original target of this raid. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=744.24s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=748.64s)]
*  He was not somebody that was on their radar, not somebody that they were going after. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=749.6s)]
*  But he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=755.04s)]
*  And that's really a key part of this crackdown by the Trump administration. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=758.8s)]
*  This idea of collateral arrests, people who are not necessarily the targets, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=764.48s)]
*  but are around the targets. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  And the senior official that we were with said that they're not really differentiating [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=771.76s)]
*  anymore between criminal and non-criminal targets. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  We always say that, you know, there's been a crime committed when he illegally crossed the border. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=780.72s)]
*  He said these people who have not necessarily a criminal history from crimes in the United States, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=786.96s)]
*  they have committed crimes by crossing into the country illegally. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=793.28s)]
*  There's a crime committed when he's working without work authorization. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=796.88s)]
*  There's a crime committed when he's opening up a bank account. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=799.44s)]
*  So I know we sometimes say that individuals, you know, they don't have any criminal record. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=802.24s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of crimes being committed. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=806.24s)]
*  It's just that under the past administration, those crimes are somewhat overlooked. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=808.0s)]
*  That in fact, in their mind, place them into the same bucket as other people that are [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=811.76s)]
*  historically known as criminals that ICE targets. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=818.32s)]
*  That's really interesting because during the campaign, I think a lot of people assumed that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=821.52s)]
*  when Trump said he would be targeting criminals, he meant violent criminals, like people involved [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=826.32s)]
*  in really serious crimes. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=831.52s)]
*  And when I hear you talk about this kind of broader definition of the criminals that they're going [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=833.6s)]
*  after, it is hard to not think about how much pressure they're under to just get more people [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=838.88s)]
*  in detention to deport more people. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=847.68s)]
*  Do you think these things are related that they've widened the net because they can't [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=849.92s)]
*  meet their numbers otherwise? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=855.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think if you're ICE, you need to widen the net and go after different groups of people, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=857.76s)]
*  not just the worst of the worst. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  And if anybody in the country who is here illegally is a target, that certainly helps [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  with meeting these quotas and these demands. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=870.7199999999999s)]
*  Was he pushing for more arrests, like, you know, get the numbers up? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, and I actually asked Ripa about this meeting with Miller and ICE officials [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=877.52s)]
*  at the ICE headquarters. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=883.76s)]
*  I don't think he was pushing for more arrests. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=886.24s)]
*  I think he was pushing for more initiatives. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=887.68s)]
*  So I think his message was you have a lot of tools in the tool belt. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=890.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's just make sure we're utilizing all those tools. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=893.6s)]
*  He was definitely careful in the words that he chose, but he did allude to this kind of [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=896.64s)]
*  pressure and this, you know, request for more enforcement for getting the numbers up. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=902.4s)]
*  And Ripa also said, like, you know, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=910.0s)]
*  Obviously, he's looking at the numbers and he works for the president and he wants to [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=911.6s)]
*  make sure that we're meeting the president's agenda and the department's agenda. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=915.76s)]
*  Miller has his own perspective. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  Obviously, he wants to carry out the goals of the president and, you know, almost kind [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=921.76s)]
*  of alluding, of course, to this idea of mass deportation and mass arrest. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=926.72s)]
*  I think this is what the administration wants. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=930.88s)]
*  It's individuals who are in the country illegally and criminals at that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=933.92s)]
*  So we heard about the first stop. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=941.52s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=943.52s)]
*  Yeah, from there, we went to a upscale neighborhood. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=945.04s)]
*  This is Alton Road and this is the heart and center of Miami Beach. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=948.56s)]
*  And we parked on the side of the road. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=955.04s)]
*  We were waiting for this individual who was from Mexico, who had their student visa revoked [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=957.36s)]
*  allegedly because of some issues with embezzlement charges in Mexico. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=965.6s)]
*  And we waited a little longer this time, I would say probably around an hour. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=971.6800000000001s)]
*  Oh, wait, they said we've seen 843. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  They knew actually the time that he usually would leave his house. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=981.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. They'd been tracking him. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=986.4s)]
*  Yeah, this is something that ICE commonly does is surveillance on their targets. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=988.56s)]
*  Oftentimes they rely on knowing when people leave their houses to pick them up out in public. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=992.72s)]
*  And in this case, that's exactly what happened. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=999.92s)]
*  Okay, thanks. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1005.04s)]
*  Is the plan to let him drive a little bit and pull him over? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1006.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you want me to get a gun? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1016.4s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1017.36s)]
*  This individual drove out with her car and was pulled over by several cars [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1020.9599999999999s)]
*  and detained on the side of the road. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1027.76s)]
*  And in the car was his daughter and his wife. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1030.6399999999999s)]
*  Ma'am, what is your name? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1036.08s)]
*  Alejandra. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1038.24s)]
*  Alejandra. Do you have his identification with you? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1038.96s)]
*  I don't know. Can I please start talking with this lawyer, please? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1041.6s)]
*  His wife seemed really emotional on the phone with their lawyer. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1046.1599999999999s)]
*  And actually at one point, one of the ICE officers told her to calm down. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1051.84s)]
*  He was going to walk her through what was going on. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1055.76s)]
*  We're going to take him to the office, which is in Miramar. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1058.3999999999999s)]
*  They're going to take him to Miramar. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1062.3999999999999s)]
*  I cannot go in there, but I can follow you. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1064.32s)]
*  It's really kind of an emotional scene, I think, which really speaks to [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1069.04s)]
*  what a life-changing moment an ICE arrest can be and the ripple effects on families. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1072.08s)]
*  This is a family that is now, for all intents and purposes, separated from their father. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1080.6399999999999s)]
*  And seeing that up close and personal was really important. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1087.12s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, you're watching them watch this unfold. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, it just sounds so intense, honestly. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1095.36s)]
*  And I'm wondering beyond just the raw emotion of this moment, what you're making of this second stop. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1099.52s)]
*  Yeah. What really jumps out here is the amount of resources that it took just to arrest one person. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1106.96s)]
*  I mean, you had several cars, more than 12 officers on scene, agents from the FBI, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1113.68s)]
*  somebody from the State Department, ICE officers. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1121.6000000000001s)]
*  So many people gathered just to arrest one individual, which I think really speaks to [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1125.28s)]
*  the difficulty of arresting people in American communities. It just takes so many people. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1131.92s)]
*  Is this not something you would have seen in the past, just this kind of outlay of resources? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1139.12s)]
*  Yeah. You definitely wouldn't have seen the FBI, the State Department, other agencies on the ground [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1145.52s)]
*  diverting resources to help ICE arrest one person. And the thing I would point out is that this was [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1152.64s)]
*  the last operation for the day. We started at 5 45 in the morning and the operation lasted around [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1158.24s)]
*  four hours. So you have several cars, you have more than 12 officers, and ICE ended up arresting [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  three people. And one of them wasn't even a target. It was just like a fluke. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1175.92s)]
*  Totally. Yeah, exactly. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1180.8s)]
*  That's some pretty hard math, if you're ICE. I mean, I presume that the ICE leadership can also do that math, right? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1182.56s)]
*  How are they going to meet these really lofty deportation goals? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1189.6s)]
*  Yeah, that remains to be seen. But one of the ways that you can get there is through these [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1194.24s)]
*  worksite operations that we've seen across the country in recent days and weeks where ICE is [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1200.24s)]
*  actually able to show up at different locations where people are working and they can arrest [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1206.24s)]
*  a large number of people at a time. So that's one way. And another is this idea of self-deportation. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1213.52s)]
*  This is a message that the Trump administration has been sending constantly in recent weeks, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1221.6s)]
*  this idea of leave the country voluntarily before we come and find you. And these operations, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1227.68s)]
*  I think, serve that purpose as well. It's sending this message that ICE is all across the country. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1234.32s)]
*  They're going to workplaces. They're going to people's homes. They're going to parking lots. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1240.56s)]
*  And potentially, it could send this deterrent message to people that they should leave now [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1245.76s)]
*  and they should leave on their own accord and avoid all of this altogether. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1251.6s)]
*  You're saying basically, even though we've been talking about this huge investment of resources as [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  a potential problem for ICE, there's another way in which the intensity of these operations has this [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1261.12s)]
*  secondary effect, which is intentional, that people should just leave on their own accord to [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1267.4399999999998s)]
*  avoid getting scooped up in one of these kinds of raids. Do ICE officers say that explicitly, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1274.08s)]
*  like that that's part of the purpose of their raids? What is the message this is sending to [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1280.08s)]
*  folks who are undocumented and don't have any interaction with the criminal justice system? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1284.4799999999998s)]
*  We asked this of Mr. Rippa and he didn't say that this was the purpose explicitly, but he said there [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1289.28s)]
*  is a broader message behind it. I think the message is clear that we are treating those individuals [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1295.12s)]
*  as criminals based on their manner of entry and they should take advantage of [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1301.92s)]
*  other means to depart voluntarily. They want people to leave the country before ICE comes [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1309.68s)]
*  and finds them. They are sending this message through everybody that they possibly can and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1316.16s)]
*  trying to advocate for people to leave now. It strikes me that part of this messaging is to [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1322.88s)]
*  undocumented immigrants, but there's another part of the messaging that is being directed at sanctuary [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1329.76s)]
*  cities where ICE is basically saying, you need to cooperate with us. You need to let us into your [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1335.8400000000001s)]
*  jails. You need to work with us. If you don't, you're going to keep seeing raids like this. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1343.44s)]
*  You're going to keep seeing these kinds of actions in these liberal cities like Los Angeles. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1348.64s)]
*  100%. This is something that the Trump administration has said they will do, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1354.4s)]
*  that these sanctuary communities are not going to keep them from coming into arrest undocumented [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1359.04s)]
*  immigrants. The idea here is if you work with us, then we won't have to send all these ICE officers [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1364.48s)]
*  into the communities to find people. While we're finding those people, we're not going to run into [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1372.24s)]
*  people that weren't even on our radar, but we're going to have to pick up those people as well. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1377.92s)]
*  But the facts on the ground are that a lot of these communities are not going to [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1382.64s)]
*  cooperate with them. They're not going to be forced into working with ICE. I think it stands [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1387.04s)]
*  to reason that ICE is going to have to go further and further into American communities to get the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1392.96s)]
*  numbers that they need. You're saying that given the facts on the ground, the only way for ICE to [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1398.88s)]
*  really achieve what it's set out to do here is to go deeper and deeper into the country, to just get [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1405.7600000000002s)]
*  more aggressive. It just strikes me that especially if those efforts are concentrated in sanctuary [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1412.0s)]
*  cities, we may be seeing some of these tensions like what we're seeing in LA just continue to [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1418.0800000000002s)]
*  spill over again and again. Definitely. And these are areas that are proud of their diversity. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1423.44s)]
*  They're proud of the fact that there are so many immigrants in their communities and there is a [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1431.3600000000001s)]
*  large base of people who are willing to come out and protest and to push back on ICE. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1437.04s)]
*  I'm thinking of places like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York. So you could [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1446.24s)]
*  definitely expect that moving forward if ICE takes this type of operation across the United States. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1452.08s)]
*  These kinds of clashes may just be inevitable at this point. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1459.6s)]
*  Totally. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1464.96s)]
*  Hamid, thanks for coming on the show. Thanks for having me. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1467.9199999999998s)]
*  Protests grew in dozens of cities on Tuesday as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1475.52s)]
*  to oppose Trump's immigration crackdown. While the demonstrations across the country have largely [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1481.12s)]
*  been peaceful, they've at times led to clashes. In LA, Mayor Karen Bass declared an 8 p.m. curfew [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1486.7199999999998s)]
*  for a section of the city's downtown. In a primetime address on Tuesday night, California [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1493.4399999999998s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom made the case that Trump's decision to send military forces into LA put the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1498.9599999999998s)]
*  nation on the brink of authoritarianism, urging Americans to stand up to Trump in what he called [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1505.04s)]
*  a, quote, perilous moment for democracy. Since Friday, hundreds of people have been arrested [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1511.28s)]
*  in at least five cities, including more than 300 in LA and San Francisco. We'll be right back. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1518.0s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday morning, a former student at an Austrian [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1526.16s)]
*  high school opened fire on the campus, killing 10 people and taking his own life. It was among the [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1544.16s)]
*  worst European school shootings in years and was the deadliest attack in memory at any Austrian [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1551.12s)]
*  school. The Austrian chancellor declared three days of national mourning and if there's any [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1556.3999999999999s)]
*  protest at once and come out, they will be met with very big force. President Trump said any [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1562.96s)]
*  protesters who demonstrated during a military parade planned in Washington on Saturday would [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1568.08s)]
*  be dealt with very harshly. And I haven't even heard about a protest, but you know, this is [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1572.96s)]
*  people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force. It was a dark warning [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1579.12s)]
*  in which Trump didn't distinguish between peacefully demonstrating and engaging in violent acts. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1584.8s)]
*  The military parade was planned for the army's 250th birthday, but will also coincide with Trump's [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1590.8799999999999s)]
*  birthday. Trump said the parade would be a chance to, quote, celebrate our country for a day. We have [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1597.1999999999998s)]
*  planes, we have all sorts of things, and I think it's going to be great. We're going to celebrate [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1603.84s)]
*  our country for a change, you know. Protests have already been planned across the country on the day [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1608.88s)]
*  of the parade, though the progressive groups behind them had opted against holding demonstrations in [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmO6dk4UuAM&t=1613.8400000000001s)]
