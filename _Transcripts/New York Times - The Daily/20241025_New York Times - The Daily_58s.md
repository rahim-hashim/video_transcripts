# John Kelly Defines Trump as “Fascist”
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6TLi6Ca--s)
*  I think we should play some of this audio of your conversations with John Kelly.
*  They were phone conversations, correct?
*  This is a key moment in the conversation where you ask him the rather provocative
*  question of whether Trump in his mind would preside as a fascist if reelected.
*  Do you think he's a fascist?
*  Well, I'm looking at the definition of fascism.
*  It's a far right authoritarian, ultra nationalist political ideology and movement
*  characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism,
*  forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy.
*  It's interesting that he decides to look up the word fascist.
*  He's being very careful.
*  Careful, but also explaining it because it's this term fascist that's thrown
*  around a lot.
*  A former president is in the far right area.
*  Certainly an authoritarian admires people who are dictators.
*  He has said that.
