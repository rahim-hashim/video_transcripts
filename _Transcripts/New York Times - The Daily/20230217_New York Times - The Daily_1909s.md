Video Description: Nonprofit hospitals — which make up around half of hospitals in the United States — were founded to help the poor.


But a Times investigation has revealed that many have deviated from those charitable roots, behaving like for-profit companies, sometimes to the detriment of the health of patients.


Guest: Jessica Silver-Greenberg (https://www.nytimes.com/by/jessica-silver-greenberg?smid=pc-thedaily) , an investigative business reporter for The New York Times.


Background reading: 

  •  With the help of a consulting firm, the Providence hospital system trained staff members to wring money out of patients (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/business/nonprofit-hospitals-poor-patients.html) , even those eligible for free care.
  •  Dozens of doctors have said that this New York nonprofit hospital pressured them to give preferential treatment to donors, trustees and their families (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/health/nyu-langone-emergency-room-vip.html) .
  •  Bon Secours Mercy Health, a major nonprofit health system, used a poor neighborhood to tap into a lucrative federal drug program (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/health/bon-secours-mercy-health-profit-poor-neighborhood.html) .

# How Nonprofit Hospitals Put Profits Over Patients
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, nonprofit hospitals were founded to help the poor. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=12.0s)]
*  But a Times investigation has found that many are abandoning those patients in pursuit of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=17.56s)]
*  profits. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=23.68s)]
*  My colleague, Jessica Silver-Greenberg, on what that investigation found. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=25.36s)]
*  It's Wednesday, January 25th. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=35.64s)]
*  So Jessica, tell me about this reporting you've been doing on hospitals and this patient you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  met, Alexandra Knifors. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  OK, so Alexandra Knifors is a woman in her 60s, and she lives in Everett, Washington, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=51.36s)]
*  which is about 30 miles away from Seattle. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=58.16s)]
*  Hello? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=63.12s)]
*  Hi, Alexandra. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=64.12s)]
*  Hi there. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=65.72s)]
*  Hi. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=66.72s)]
*  I spent a fair amount of time talking to her over the course of many months last year because [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=67.72s)]
*  she had this truly harrowing medical emergency. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=73.64s)]
*  In October of 2021, she is starting to feel pretty crummy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=78.48s)]
*  I've had some sort of unidentifiable digestive system infection. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=85.16s)]
*  She was having a lot of stomach pain. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=92.16s)]
*  She was feeling dizzy. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=95.0s)]
*  I know I couldn't get dressed and I couldn't stand up. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  And eventually, Alexandra is getting so sick that her roommate is really worried and calls [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  an ambulance to take her to the hospital. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=106.24s)]
*  And Alexandra told me that at this point, she was really out of it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=109.24s)]
*  But still on some level, she's aware that this trip could cost her a lot of money. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=114.56s)]
*  You can't go to an emergency room anymore without it being thousands of dollars. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=120.64s)]
*  And I knew that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=127.28s)]
*  But at that point, I just didn't care. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=129.48s)]
*  I was so sick. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=134.12s)]
*  This is a woman who's very used to living on a very tight income. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=135.92s)]
*  Her only income is Social Security Disability, which is about $1,700 a month, every month. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=141.28s)]
*  I have constant problems with supporting my medications. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  I am disabled and I'm also diabetic. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=153.32s)]
*  And so there is a lot of expensive meds on my to-be-bought list. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=156.76s)]
*  And so when she gets to the nearby hospital, she's waiting alone and scared in the emergency [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=164.72s)]
*  department. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=171.32s)]
*  And she's eventually seen by doctors who tell her that she's in pretty bad shape. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=172.44s)]
*  Turns out that she'd been so severely dehydrated that her kidneys had failed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=178.2s)]
*  And so she's told by the emergency department staff that she's going to be admitted and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=184.6s)]
*  is probably going to have to stay for a while. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=189.48s)]
*  I was worried about my cat. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=192.28s)]
*  Oh, what's your cat's name? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=194.2s)]
*  Stubby. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=197.28s)]
*  Stubby? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=198.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, he's kind of stubby. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=199.28s)]
*  Anyway, I was very alone and I was of course afraid I was dying. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  So she's worried about her health, obviously, and she's worried about how much whatever [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=212.36s)]
*  treatment she needs are going to cost. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=217.48s)]
*  And so she described to me that every time a nurse or a doctor or anyone at the hospital [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=221.2s)]
*  had to do anything, lots and lots of blood tests and medications and every single procedure [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  she got, all she's seeing are dollar signs. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=234.6s)]
*  You know, that's another grand, a grand and a half. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=238.16s)]
*  And I knew it was going to be a huge bill. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=241.32s)]
*  I knew it was going to be enormous. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  I just figured, well, I'll be paying on this for the rest of my life. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=246.76s)]
*  So Alexander eventually gets home to Stubby. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=253.12s)]
*  And for a couple of weeks, she doesn't hear anything from the hospital. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=256.48s)]
*  At first, waiting for the bill was like waiting for the other shoe to drop. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=260.28s)]
*  And the bill arrives. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=265.48s)]
*  And while her insurance covered the bulk of her care, there was still a sizable portion, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=268.38s)]
*  for Alexandra, at least, that was left over. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  It was $1,950, which, of course, I didn't have because... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=278.44s)]
*  So more than she's taking in for the month, right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  A lot. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=287.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=288.84s)]
*  More than $200 more than she takes in every month. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=289.84s)]
*  You know, at first I was just overwhelmed. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=293.96s)]
*  Like how am I going to pay this? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=297.32s)]
*  I don't have $2,000. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=298.91999999999996s)]
*  So she goes on the hospital's website to see whether there are any options for her. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=302.36s)]
*  And what she sees are two choices. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=311.32s)]
*  Pay the bill in full or enter into a payment plan. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=313.92s)]
*  And that was $162.50 a month. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=317.8s)]
*  And I was like, oh, man. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=322.68s)]
*  Well, it means no groceries, but, you know, I can pay $162.50 a month. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=326.12s)]
*  So I've made the first payment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=332.88s)]
*  And so she starts buying fewer groceries. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, she's going without heat. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=343.0s)]
*  She starts rationing her medications, skipping days, splitting her medication in two to make [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  it last longer. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=351.36s)]
*  These are all huge sacrifices for her. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=352.76s)]
*  All in the service of paying this bill. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=356.0s)]
*  And did she consider not paying it? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=359.44s)]
*  It's a really good question. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=362.36s)]
*  And something that I asked her, did you think at all about just ignoring the bill? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=363.48s)]
*  No. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=370.48s)]
*  And why not? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=371.48s)]
*  They took really good care of me. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=374.48s)]
*  And I was alive. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=380.04s)]
*  She said whatever it takes, she is going to make good on this bill. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=381.84s)]
*  In return for the care. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=387.23999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so this bill effectively is the catastrophe that Alexandra was worried about. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=389.84s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=398.23999999999995s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  Alexandra should never have had to pay the bill in the first place. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=406.84s)]
*  Never had to pay the bill? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=411.24s)]
*  Like how? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=412.24s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=413.24s)]
*  So by law, the hospital that Alexandra went to is supposed to provide free care to Alexandra [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=414.24s)]
*  and any other patient who is a low income patient. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=421.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  That hospital is part of a massive health system called Providence. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=427.24s)]
*  And Providence was started about 100 years ago by a group of nuns in Washington state. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=432.12s)]
*  And it's what is called a not for profit hospital. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=436.76s)]
*  I see the mission as the core or the heart of our organization. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=441.0s)]
*  Providence's mission statement, for example, is that the hospital should be, quote, steadfast [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=446.96s)]
*  in serving all. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=452.52s)]
*  Especially those who are poor and vulnerable. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=454.52s)]
*  The thing about not for profit hospitals is that they have this special deal with the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=458.52s)]
*  IRS. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=472.28s)]
*  So the IRS gives them very generous tax breaks. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=473.28s)]
*  And in return, these hospitals are supposed to do a number of things to benefit their [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  communities, which can include giving free care to people who can't pay. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=481.84s)]
*  And what kind of tax breaks are we talking about when it comes to Providence? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=487.56s)]
*  Like how big? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=492.52000000000004s)]
*  Very big. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=494.36s)]
*  So in the case of Providence, about a billion dollars in tax breaks every year. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=495.36s)]
*  So a lot of money. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=501.92s)]
*  It's a lot of money. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=503.36s)]
*  And their revenues, Providence's revenues, are $27 billion a year. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=505.68s)]
*  The CEO in 2020 made $10 million. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=511.32s)]
*  And that's not all. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=515.68s)]
*  The chain is also sitting on $10 billion of cash, which it invests Wall Street style alongside [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=517.16s)]
*  private equity firms and other big deal investors. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=523.8s)]
*  But Jess, this just doesn't sound like a nonprofit at all, right? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  Wall Street, cash, war chests. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=531.56s)]
*  Like what is this? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=534.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're right. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=536.0s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=537.3599999999999s)]
*  Like, welcome to the world of nonprofit hospitals. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=538.64s)]
*  So my colleagues Katie Thomas, Sarah Cliff, and Rebecca Robbins and I spent basically [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=541.56s)]
*  a year looking into them. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=551.4799999999999s)]
*  There are 5,000 of them all over America. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=553.7199999999999s)]
*  They make up about half the hospitals in the country. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=556.8s)]
*  And they're unlike any other nonprofits I've looked at. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=560.3599999999999s)]
*  They have the kind of cash that you might expect a company like Walmart or Target or [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=563.2399999999999s)]
*  another massive for-profit operation to have. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=570.52s)]
*  And I think, Sabrina, your question about them seeming more like for-profit companies [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=574.52s)]
*  than nonprofit is a good one. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=579.96s)]
*  I mean, Providence, for example, does run itself like a for-profit business in many [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=583.0s)]
*  ways. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=588.32s)]
*  So the program that Alexandra got caught up in was specifically designed to maximize the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=589.32s)]
*  amount of money the hospital system was bringing in from some of its poorest patients. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=595.8s)]
*  So tell me about that program. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=602.12s)]
*  So the program starts around 2018. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=604.5999999999999s)]
*  And at the time, executives at Providence were looking for ways to save money. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=608.18s)]
*  The hospital system had recently merged with another nonprofit hospital. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=612.68s)]
*  And integrating these two massive systems was proving expensive. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=616.92s)]
*  And Providence was also spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year providing [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=622.32s)]
*  free care. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=627.48s)]
*  So they hired McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, to come up with a plan to get patients [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=629.22s)]
*  to fork over money. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=635.4000000000001s)]
*  And they called it Rev Up, as in revenue up. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=637.5s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  The centerpiece of this program were a series of scripts, like theatrical scripts, that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  outlined in this play exactly how employees should try to get money from patients, even [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=649.34s)]
*  those who were supposed to receive free care. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=656.5s)]
*  And these documents were distributed to anyone at the hospital who might interact with patients [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=659.76s)]
*  and talk to them about payment. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=664.7800000000001s)]
*  So in one training document, for example, the employees were told, do not accept the [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=667.82s)]
*  first no. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=674.38s)]
*  And then staff are led through a series of questions to ask patients. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=676.26s)]
*  The first was, how would you like to pay that today? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=680.34s)]
*  If that question didn't work, employees were told to ask for half the balance. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=684.58s)]
*  If that didn't work, staff could offer to set up a payment plan, like the kind that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  Alexandra went on. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=695.78s)]
*  And what's critically missing from this collection program is any way of screening patients to [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=697.98s)]
*  determine whether they should qualify for free care. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=707.54s)]
*  So they don't even know if the person they're talking to would qualify for free care. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=711.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=715.9s)]
*  So that is quite a hard sell of give me your credit card, basically. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=721.46s)]
*  And there were things that weren't included in those training scripts that also contributed [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=727.62s)]
*  to what became really a boiler room kind of atmosphere within some of Providence's hospitals. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=733.42s)]
*  It became so kind of built in to the culture at Providence that on one Halloween at one [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=742.9399999999999s)]
*  of Providence's hospitals, an employee dressed up as a wrestler named Rev Up Ricky. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=751.0999999999999s)]
*  And another costume during this Halloween featured a giant cardboard dollar sign that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=759.18s)]
*  had how printed on it, which was a reference to the way that staff were supposed to ask [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=765.9s)]
*  patients how, not whether, they would like to pay. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=773.9399999999999s)]
*  How did employees feel about this? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=779.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is a very potentially deeply uncomfortable thing to ask patients. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=781.22s)]
*  A lot of the employees that I spoke to, some of whom had no more money than the patients [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=786.6600000000001s)]
*  they were hounding, were really unsettled by this because they were also aware of just [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=792.7800000000001s)]
*  how rich this hospital system is. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=801.0600000000001s)]
*  And so one woman who worked in the emergency department said that really the tactics that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=804.94s)]
*  she was told to use struck her as completely predatory. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=811.36s)]
*  She was told to approach patients almost as soon as doctors had finished examining them. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=817.1800000000001s)]
*  So like doctor leaves the room and she walks in and she crouches at their bedside and asks [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=822.62s)]
*  for money. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=830.0200000000001s)]
*  And she was required to put in patients' medical charts that she had repeatedly asked [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=831.38s)]
*  for payments. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=837.3s)]
*  Because if that wasn't in there and her bosses caught wind of it, she would suffer the consequences. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=838.48s)]
*  She would be called out. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=844.26s)]
*  And it was in their medical charts? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=845.26s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=847.5s)]
*  It was written into their medical charts, yeah. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=848.78s)]
*  I mean, it's particularly jarring, right, because of the origin and mission of Providence, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=851.9s)]
*  helping poor people, providing care for poor people. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=857.9s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=860.38s)]
*  So what do executives at Providence say about RevUp and the company culture? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=861.38s)]
*  Like how do they explain this? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=866.06s)]
*  Well, we were able to get on the phone with Providence's chief financial officer who did [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=867.74s)]
*  say that our findings were concerning. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=873.46s)]
*  And he emphasized that the hospital system wants to get it right, to do well by their [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=876.3s)]
*  patients. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=882.38s)]
*  But Providence also pretty emphatically defended its practices. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=883.62s)]
*  And they pointed out to us that in Washington state, for example, Providence provides more [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=889.62s)]
*  free healthcare than any other hospital. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=894.74s)]
*  But the thing is, Providence was just one of the hospital systems we looked into that [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=900.92s)]
*  had strayed far from its charitable roots and was acting more like a for-profit company. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=906.1s)]
*  And sometimes that kind of behavior had really serious consequences for the health of patients. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=912.62s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=925.42s)]
*  So Jessica, you said that Providence was just one example of the for-profit behavior you [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=936.26s)]
*  found while investigating not-for-profit hospitals. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=944.5s)]
*  What else did you find in your reporting? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=947.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, one of the most shocking examples of this kind of rapacious for-profit behavior [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=950.1s)]
*  came from another giant not-for-profit health system called Bonsacores. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=956.7s)]
*  And Bonsacores found a way to just mint hundreds of millions of dollars off a tiny poor hospital [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=962.54s)]
*  in Virginia called Richmond Community. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=970.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=972.38s)]
*  How did they do that? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=973.74s)]
*  Well, first, let me tell you a little bit about Richmond Community. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=974.74s)]
*  It was founded in the 1900s by black doctors who weren't allowed to work at the white hospitals [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=978.6999999999999s)]
*  across town. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=984.86s)]
*  And it was a modest building, ringed by public housing projects. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=986.18s)]
*  And it didn't have all the services at larger hospitals, but it did have specialists in [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=991.42s)]
*  cancer, heart, and lung disease. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=995.42s)]
*  And people were proud of this little hospital that could. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=998.42s)]
*  It was a place where black patients could be treated by black doctors, and there was [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1001.5s)]
*  a sense of pride both in its history and its mission. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1005.34s)]
*  But over the years, for a bunch of reasons, it got harder and harder for independent institutions [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1009.3s)]
*  like community to stay afloat. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1014.78s)]
*  So fast forward to 1995, the doctors who owned it sold it to Bonsacores. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1018.06s)]
*  And executives at Bonsacores eventually realized they could use this poor hospital to tap into [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1025.8999999999999s)]
*  a very lucrative federal drug program. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1032.86s)]
*  The program allows hospitals like community that serve low-income patients to buy prescription [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1036.46s)]
*  drugs at steep, steep discounts, and then charge insurers full price for those same [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1042.86s)]
*  drugs and pocket the difference. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1048.78s)]
*  So seems reasonable. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1051.54s)]
*  Poor neighborhoods should have discounts on drugs. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1053.4599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1056.1399999999999s)]
*  That was the intention of the program, which is called 340B. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1057.1399999999999s)]
*  The theory behind this program was that nonprofit hospitals would invest the savings, that windfall, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1061.34s)]
*  into their communities. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1068.6599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1069.6599999999999s)]
*  After Bonsacores bought Richmond Community, it figured out how to use this program to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1070.66s)]
*  supercharge its profits. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1075.42s)]
*  What Bonsacores did is they began building clinics in wealthier neighborhoods where patients [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1078.3000000000002s)]
*  had private insurance. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1083.26s)]
*  And each of these new locations, even though they were far away from Richmond Community [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1085.14s)]
*  and not serving poor patients, were still allowed to take advantage of the same drug [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1089.74s)]
*  discounts. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1094.38s)]
*  So Bonsacores just basically franchises this program to a whole bunch of different locations, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1095.78s)]
*  even though those communities weren't meant to receive the discount. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1101.46s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1104.84s)]
*  And on paper, these new locations were just extensions of Richmond Community Hospital. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1106.1399999999999s)]
*  So how much money does that make Bonsacores, and where does it go? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1112.02s)]
*  So we know that Richmond Community Hospital generated about $100 million a year through [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1116.36s)]
*  this program. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1121.8999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1122.8999999999999s)]
*  A lot. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1123.8999999999999s)]
*  A lot. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1124.9s)]
*  The vast majority of that revenue from our reporting is thanks to this program. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1126.42s)]
*  But then, to get back to your question, where did this money go? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1134.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, that is one of the things that we started to investigate. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1137.7800000000002s)]
*  And that's a really big question. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1142.3000000000002s)]
*  We know that executives at Bonsacores are paid like for-profit executives, similar to [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1144.38s)]
*  Providence. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1149.46s)]
*  The CEO at Bonsacores made $6 million in 2020. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1151.3400000000001s)]
*  And we also know from our reporting that Bonsacores clinics in wealthy neighborhoods have really [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1155.74s)]
*  great amenities, marble fountains and golf carts to shuttle patients from their cars. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1161.98s)]
*  Meanwhile, Bonsacores was really stripping services from Richmond Community Hospital. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1168.3s)]
*  In 2017, it closed the ICU. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1174.46s)]
*  And one of the doctors we spoke to, whose family was involved in the founding of Richmond [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1178.66s)]
*  Community, said that closing the ICU really took the heart out of the hospital. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1184.14s)]
*  Because once the ICU was closed, the lung specialists and other specialists like cardiologists [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1189.5s)]
*  had nowhere to treat seriously ill patients. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1195.82s)]
*  So you start to see this attrition, this exodus of specialists, you know, the lung [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1199.66s)]
*  specialists leave and then the cardiologists follow them. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1204.74s)]
*  And Bonsacores does not replace these doctors. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1209.02s)]
*  So Richmond Community really becomes a shell of itself. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1212.46s)]
*  Okay, so this is all pretty incredible, right? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1215.7s)]
*  I mean, you have this larger system, Bonsacores, making more and more money off the back of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1218.5400000000002s)]
*  this smaller hospital, Richmond Community, even as it stripped that same hospital of [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1224.3s)]
*  its services. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1230.34s)]
*  So what did the doctors and the people at Richmond Community Hospital have to say about [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1231.96s)]
*  this? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1236.22s)]
*  Well, so one doctor we interviewed who worked in Richmond Community's emergency department [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1237.22s)]
*  until 2018, he put it pretty bluntly. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1243.6599999999999s)]
*  He said Bonsacores was basically laundering money through this poor hospital to its wealthy [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1247.6s)]
*  outposts. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1253.78s)]
*  And he was outraged about it. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1255.78s)]
*  And he said it was all about profits. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1257.82s)]
*  At this nonprofit hospital. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1261.1000000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1262.82s)]
*  And how does Bonsacores justify this? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1264.5s)]
*  What do they say to the people inside Richmond Community Hospital who need to go to the ICU [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1267.98s)]
*  and can't? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1273.8600000000001s)]
*  So Bonsacores' argument, both to the doctors who protested these cuts and to patients, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1276.16s)]
*  was that if patients in the East End needed services that Richmond Community Hospital [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1284.0400000000002s)]
*  doesn't offer, they can always go to other hospitals in the Bonsacores system. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1290.16s)]
*  But there's a problem with that, which is those hospitals are miles away and they're [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1296.3200000000002s)]
*  not easily reachable by public transit for the people who live near Richmond Community [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1302.16s)]
*  Hospital. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1308.3600000000001s)]
*  And a lot of those people don't have cars. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1309.3600000000001s)]
*  And in practice, we found cases where the fact that Richmond Community Hospital was [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1311.98s)]
*  so diminished actually harmed patients, really harmed them. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1317.76s)]
*  I mean, a case that has stuck with me throughout this reporting that I was really pretty haunted [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  by was the case of a man named Norman Odie. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1329.28s)]
*  So this summer, he was rushed by ambulance to Richmond Community Hospital. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1334.44s)]
*  He was in his 60s and was doubled over in pain and he was babbling at this point pretty [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1339.04s)]
*  incoherently. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1344.6s)]
*  And blood tests suggested septic shock, which is an emergency that requires resources and [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1346.3999999999999s)]
*  the expertise of an intensive care unit to treat. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1353.82s)]
*  But Richmond, as we've said, had closed its ICU in 2017. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1358.0s)]
*  So there was no ICU for him to go to. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1362.52s)]
*  And it took several hours for him to be transported to another hospital. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1365.58s)]
*  And he deteriorated on the way there and he later died of sepsis. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1370.56s)]
*  And two people who cared for Mr. Odie said the delay had most likely contributed to his death. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1375.52s)]
*  Wow, that is an indictment of the decisions that the hospital system made. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1383.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1388.0s)]
*  So this is the kind of human toll that we saw, where in theory what Bonsacores is saying [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1389.52s)]
*  makes perfect sense. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1396.04s)]
*  But the mechanics of it break down as we saw. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1398.04s)]
*  So Jessica, just stepping back here for a second, your reporting has shown that many [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1406.16s)]
*  nonprofit hospitals, including some of the biggest hospital systems in the country, are [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1411.12s)]
*  really effectively operating as for-profit companies. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1416.52s)]
*  But they're still getting these huge and lucrative tax breaks and subsidies from the government. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1420.76s)]
*  So I guess my question for you is, how did we get here? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1427.56s)]
*  I mean, why have nonprofit hospitals gone in this direction? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1431.6399999999999s)]
*  So when we talk to nonprofit hospital executives, they say that they're in a pretty tough spot. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1437.28s)]
*  They're competing with a whole host of rivals, not just other not-for-profit hospitals, but [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1444.0s)]
*  also for-profit hospitals. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1449.6399999999999s)]
*  And in order to compete and live up to their mission, they need to be strong financial [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1452.44s)]
*  stewards. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1457.56s)]
*  The phrase that we heard again and again when we spoke to executives is the phrase, no margin, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1458.6399999999999s)]
*  no mission. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1465.26s)]
*  The idea is that if you're not in a strong financial position, if you don't have a lot [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1466.88s)]
*  of cash, you won't survive, and you won't be able to fulfill your mission if you don't exist, right? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1472.0800000000002s)]
*  So executives justify this kind of profit-seeking behavior because they say, look, we want to [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1479.0400000000002s)]
*  expand, we want to provide more care for more people. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1485.16s)]
*  And in order to do that, we're competing for investors, we're trying to make sure that [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1489.1200000000001s)]
*  we can borrow money at low interest rates so that we can expand less expensively. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1493.2s)]
*  But as your reporting has shown us, there are real consequences to that behavior. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1498.72s)]
*  And yet they're still receiving these tax benefits. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1503.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1506.0800000000002s)]
*  We found that much of the problem lies with the IRS. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1507.4s)]
*  So the IRS is not really policing these hospitals to see whether or not they are following the [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1510.92s)]
*  rules. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  And the problem is that the rules themselves that hospitals have to follow to justify their [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1519.0s)]
*  tax exemptions are pretty squishy. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1524.6399999999999s)]
*  So the IRS now allows hospitals to provide a broad range of very loosely defined benefits [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1528.6999999999998s)]
*  to justify their tax breaks. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1536.8s)]
*  And some hospitals have seized upon this new leeway and argued that things like employees' [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1539.24s)]
*  salaries counted towards the IRS requirement or building a shiny new surgical center in [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1545.72s)]
*  a suburb where all the patients are pretty wealthy, that also counts towards fulfilling [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1552.4s)]
*  this again pretty squishy, loosely defined community benefit. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1558.32s)]
*  Jess, is any of what these hospitals were doing illegal? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1564.68s)]
*  For the most part, no. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1570.52s)]
*  With Providence, the attorney general in Washington state actually sued the hospital system in [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1572.52s)]
*  February of last year and did argue that Providence's collection practices were in violation of [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1581.16s)]
*  the state law, in part because they were using debt collectors to pursue, and the scale of [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1591.48s)]
*  this is pretty stunning, about 55,000 patient accounts that the state attorney general argued [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1598.16s)]
*  should never have been sent to collections. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1606.96s)]
*  And the lawsuit said that Providence wrongly claimed that those patients owed more than [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1610.0800000000002s)]
*  $73 million. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1616.68s)]
*  But Providence fervently denies that anything they did was illegal. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1618.92s)]
*  So that's the closest that we came to allegations of illegal behavior. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1624.16s)]
*  And Jess, do we have a sense of what the decision might be in that lawsuit? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1630.4s)]
*  We don't. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1634.64s)]
*  We have some clues as to how it might go, although I could never predict how a lawsuit [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1635.92s)]
*  of any kind is going to go. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1642.96s)]
*  But Providence has already said it will stop using debt collectors to pursue money from [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1644.92s)]
*  low-income patients who should qualify for free care in Washington state. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1650.68s)]
*  So that is a move. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1654.96s)]
*  And actually, shortly after our story on Providence ran, the hospital system said it would refund [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1657.3200000000002s)]
*  payments that more than 700 low-income patients made. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1663.6000000000001s)]
*  And they said that those people had been wrongly charged for medical care that should have been free. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1670.16s)]
*  And what about Alexandra? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1676.0800000000002s)]
*  Did she get her money back? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1677.3s)]
*  Well, so Alexandra's story has a happy-ish ending. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1679.0s)]
*  She does get her money back. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1684.32s)]
*  But this holer deal with Providence has really stuck with her. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1686.32s)]
*  You know, when I asked her what she thinks of Providence now and how she might feel about [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1690.36s)]
*  having to go back to the hospital if she gets sick with anything else, she said she's afraid [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1694.76s)]
*  of the hospital. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1700.7199999999998s)]
*  You know, in the part of Washington state where she lives, Providence is really the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1703.1999999999998s)]
*  only game in town. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1707.76s)]
*  So if she does have to go back to the hospital, she's worried that Providence will refuse [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1709.68s)]
*  to treat her because of how vocal she has been about what happened to her. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1717.52s)]
*  And I did try to reassure her that if Providence were to deny her life-saving care, that would [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1723.44s)]
*  likely be illegal. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1729.6200000000001s)]
*  But honestly, I'm not sure that did much to assuage her concerns. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1732.0800000000002s)]
*  Because you know, she's still sick. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1737.2s)]
*  And the way she sees it, this hospital system took advantage of her once. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1740.48s)]
*  Why wouldn't they do it again? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1747.64s)]
*  Jess, thank you. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1752.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1753.32s)]
*  After the Times investigation ran, Richmond's mayor called for a federal investigation into [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1757.16s)]
*  Bon Secours, while the hospital system pledged to reinvest in the neighborhood around Richmond [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5zcCwTK5pc&t=1761.72s)]
