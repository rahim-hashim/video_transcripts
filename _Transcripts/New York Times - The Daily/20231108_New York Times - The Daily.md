# The Trumps Take the Stand
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6plkl8dADek)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, of the many charges and lawsuits filed against former President Trump, perhaps the
*  most personal is playing out in a courtroom in New York City, in a case that could end
*  in him losing control of his best known buildings and paying hundreds of millions of dollars
*  in fines.
*  Over the past few days, my colleague, Jonah Bromwich, has been inside the courtroom watching
*  as Trump's children and Trump himself have taken the stand.
*  It's Wednesday, November 8th.
*  Jonah, thank you for taking a break in your busy schedule of being in the courtroom.
*  I'm very happy to be here.
*  So Jonah, you've spent the past several days in a New York City courtroom where, for the
*  first time, the adult sons of Donald Trump and Donald Trump himself have all taken the
*  stand and testified.
*  And we're going to get to their testimony.
*  But I want to start by asking you to just describe this case, because there are so many
*  cases against Donald Trump.
*  This is one of many, and it's a civil case, which is probably why I think it's gotten
*  a lot less attention than all the criminal cases against Trump.
*  Just tell us about this case.
*  So this case was brought by New York's Attorney General, Letitia James.
*  James ran for office in 2018, and she ran for office talking about Donald Trump a lot
*  of the time.
*  Right.
*  She's a Democrat, and she made clear he was in her sights.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And so she takes office in 2019, and shortly thereafter, Michael Cohen, who's a former
*  fixer for Trump, he testifies in front of Congress.
*  And I don't know if you remember this kind of from the fog of the Trump presidency.
*  I do.
*  But he testifies about some of the conduct that Donald Trump has undertaken that might
*  be of interest to Congress.
*  And that includes manipulating the values of his property to get favorable loans from
*  banks, from insurers.
*  And so with Letitia James in office...
*  Good morning.
*  Her comments quickly turn into an investigation.
*  I am announcing that today we are filing a lawsuit against Donald Trump.
*  And that investigation turns into a lawsuit that she files in 2022 against Trump and against
*  his adult sons and against his company.
*  The complaint demonstrates that Donald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions
*  of dollars to unjustly enrich himself and to cheat the system, thereby cheating all
*  of us.
*  And broadly, she's accusing him of exaggerating the values of a lot of his properties, his
*  hotels, his apartment buildings, his golf clubs.
*  And there's some really good kind of specific details in here.
*  So for example...
*  Take Mr. Trump's triplex, you know, the triplex apartment in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue.
*  One of the properties at issue is Trump Tower, and he has this triplex apartment in Trump
*  Tower.
*  Right.
*  Now, this number is burned into my brain.
*  His triplex apartment is 10,996 square feet.
*  Nice big apartment.
*  That's right.
*  But for years...
*  Mr. Trump represented that his apartment spanned more than 30,000 square feet.
*  Trump was saying it was three times that big on the financial statements.
*  That was the value of it, as if it were 30,000 feet.
*  And based on that inflated square footage, the value of the apartment in 2015 and 2016
*  was $327 million.
*  To this date, no apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount.
*  Tripling the size of the apartment for purposes of the valuation was intentional and deliberate
*  fraud, not an honest mistake.
*  So this is a great example of what he's accused of doing writ large.
*  He's exaggerating the number of square feet in the apartment.
*  He's valuing it as if it were three times as big as it actually is.
*  And that's the number that goes into the financial statement.
*  And those financial statements go to banks and insurers.
*  To what end?
*  Overall, the attorney general says by doing this, the loan terms were better, the insurance
*  terms were better.
*  It gave him favorable treatment from those companies that he was doing business with.
*  And she's asking for really serious punishments out of this.
*  She's asking for at least a $250 million fine.
*  Wow, quarter of a billion dollars.
*  That's right.
*  She's asking that Trump be permanently barred from doing business in New York.
*  Wait, I want to pause on that because that's a very big deal.
*  Trump's business, the Trump organization is based in New York.
*  He owns a ton of big buildings in New York.
*  That would be a huge deal.
*  This case strikes at the foundation of Donald Trump's personal image, public image.
*  This guy is a builder, a businessman, a New York real estate developer.
*  And this case directly targets that.
*  Right.
*  Sounds like this case seeks to basically separate those buildings, that empire from the man
*  itself.
*  Literally.
*  And if James gets her way, by the end of this case, Donald Trump won't be able to do business
*  in New York.
*  Well, so what happens as this case moves from allegation toward court case and closer and
*  closer to a trial?
*  So because of the nature of this case, the nature of the law that it's brought under
*  and the kinds of consequences that James is asking for, there's only a judge in this case.
*  There's no jury.
*  So the judge is the ultimate finder of fact.
*  Okay.
*  His name's Arthur F. Angoran.
*  He's quirky.
*  He likes to make jokes from the bench.
*  He makes all these old timey references, like he referenced Fiddler on the Roof and One
*  Ruling and...
*  Only in New York.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  In the late summer, early fall, James asks him to rule before the trial on the issues
*  at the heart of the case.
*  And we don't necessarily expect him to do it, but he does.
*  He does just that.
*  And what he rules is that the annual financial statements where the values were contained,
*  that those are fraudulent and that they were repeatedly and persistently used in business.
*  That's the heart of her case right there.
*  Wow.
*  Long before there's a trial, this judge, who is the sole decider of this case, basically
*  finds that the Attorney General's case, her allegations are correct.
*  It's just a little more chaotic than that.
*  This is just a week before the trial.
*  Wow.
*  Okay.
*  And what does that mean for the trial as it's approaching?
*  So it means that the issue at the heart of the trial is over.
*  We had thought this trial is going to be about proving that fraud happened, but we already
*  know that the judge believes that fraud happened.
*  So now the trial is really about the consequences.
*  This trial is going to be about the judge learning more about how the statements were
*  valued, about how much money the Trumps made from it, all to better determine whether there
*  should be punishments and how severe they should be.
*  So this is fascinating.
*  This is basically a trial that Donald Trump and his children have already lost before
*  it begins.
*  And everything that's going to happen in this trial is just going to be a question
*  of the degree of loss for them.
*  A lot of that is true, yeah.
*  The stakes are still crazy high for them because the punishments are still at issue, the fine
*  and really their future as business people, at least real estate business people.
*  Okay.
*  So this, I think, brings us to the trial and to the testimony of all these Trumps and a
*  question I have had as I have watched this trial over the past couple of days, which
*  is why would a member of the Trump family, Jonah, testify in this trial?
*  We have all come to understand that powerful people don't take the stand.
*  It's too risky.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  And it's a great question.
*  I think it's a question a lot of people have been asking and it has to do with the nature
*  of the case.
*  This is a civil case, not a criminal case.
*  In a criminal case, the finder of fact, be it the judge or the jury, they can't hold
*  it against the defendant when they decline to testify.
*  They can't assume, oh, they'd be lying, oh, they're scared.
*  They're prohibited from doing that.
*  Right.
*  If you take the fifth, it can't be held against you.
*  It's your right.
*  In a civil case, they can make what's called negative or adverse inference.
*  They can assume the worst when you don't testify.
*  If you don't want to testify about this particular lawsuit, well, it may be because you're guilty
*  of every single thing that you're accused of doing in it.
*  Got it.
*  In other words, the Trumps don't legally have to testify in this case, but if they don't,
*  it's probably going to result in a terrible outcome for them.
*  So in a way, they kind of have to testify.
*  That's right.
*  It'd almost be like forfeiting their case were they not to testify.
*  And so this week, one by one, the Trumps arrive in the courtroom.
*  First Donald Trump Jr., then Eric Trump, and then former president Donald J. Trump.
*  And their testimony is really, really revealing.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jonah, walk us through this testimony Trump by Trump.
*  Okay, so we start with Donald Trump Jr.
*  And to understand his testimony, you need to understand something about the Trump Organization.
*  When Donald Trump became president, he put Donald Trump Jr. and his CFO in charge of
*  this trust that controls his assets.
*  It's a pretty symbolic position, but that's something that Donald Trump Jr. was doing.
*  He was signing things on behalf of the trust, which really means he was signing them on
*  behalf of his father.
*  Right.
*  He would have used this trust, if I'm remembering correctly, to insulate himself from the day-to-day
*  operation of the Trump Organization when he was president, because there'd be conflicts
*  of interest, etc.
*  You remember exactly correctly.
*  That's what he did.
*  Okay.
*  So how does that apply to this lawsuit?
*  So because he has the ceremonial role, he has his name on certain documents.
*  And those documents, every so often, will be a letter to the company's external accountants
*  that says, hey, these financial statements that we put together every year, they're accurate,
*  and I certify they're accurate.
*  And he signs those documents.
*  He signs those documents.
*  That means that Donald Trump Jr. is signing documents that say, my financial statements
*  are accurate.
*  But as we know, the judge and the attorney general have said, no, these are filled with
*  fraud.
*  Got it.
*  So how does this testimony go, given that he has signed these claims that something
*  is accurate that the judge has already determined are not accurate?
*  It goes pretty poorly.
*  And this is a hallmark of the attorney general's case.
*  She has this very strong paper case.
*  She has a lot of documents, and those documents look bad for the defendants.
*  And so when Donald Trump Jr. is presented with this letter, there's not that much he
*  can do.
*  But he does kind of the worst thing he could do.
*  Which is what?
*  He's on the stand.
*  He's asked about this letter.
*  And with very little hesitation, he just describes it as a quote unquote, cover your butt letter.
*  By which he means what exactly?
*  I think he meant that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously.
*  He said in this very dismissive way, like, oh, you know, sometimes you just sign stuff.
*  But of course, that's not how business or the law works.
*  Right.
*  When you sign a document, you're attesting to something or you're certifying something.
*  It has real meaning.
*  What's so interesting about this is that it reminded me of former President Donald Trump,
*  where there are statements that are not meant to be taken seriously or they're meant to
*  be taken half seriously.
*  And he sometimes seems as if he knows what those are and he expects you to know too.
*  And that's what I saw from Donald Trump Jr.
*  So here you're saying Donald Trump Jr. is applying his father's philosophy, this kind
*  of anything goes, looseness with words, approach to life.
*  And he's applying that to his courtroom testimony, where of course, words matter a lot.
*  Right.
*  The idea seems to be some things matter, some things don't, and I'm the one who gets to
*  decide.
*  And that was pretty typical of his testimony.
*  He seemed relaxed, almost cavalier up there.
*  He was answering questions at a mile a minute.
*  And I sometimes was just like, why isn't this guy slowing down and thinking about what he's
*  being asked and how it might damage him?
*  Because it didn't really seem like he was doing that, which was a huge contrast, by
*  the way, to Eric Trump, who came up next.
*  Okay.
*  So tell us about Eric Trump's testimony.
*  So Eric Trump is in some ways the opposite of his brother when he appears on the stand.
*  He's very cautious.
*  He doesn't seem relaxed.
*  He seems unhappy to be there.
*  And he doesn't mind you knowing it.
*  And the other thing to know is that Eric Trump has a more central role at the Trump Organization.
*  And he's more involved overall in what's going on here.
*  Just explain that.
*  Eric Trump is an executive vice president, but he's doing all kinds of different stuff.
*  He's doing operations.
*  He's helping with different projects around the United States.
*  He's really at the heart of a lot of what the Trump Organization does once his father
*  is in office.
*  And so the attorney general has accused Eric not just of the symbolic role that Donald
*  Trump Jr. played, but of actually being involved in some of these valuations.
*  And what were some examples of that?
*  So the most prominent example has to do with an estate called the Seven Springs Estate.
*  And this place is really kind of fundamental to the Eric Trump mythology.
*  He worked there.
*  He lived there.
*  It's this beautiful kind of sprawling piece of land in Westchester, which is kind of a
*  schmancy place north of New York City.
*  And what he's accused of doing is just a little microcosm of what the company and the Trumps
*  are accused of doing overall, pumping up the value of this place into the hundreds
*  of millions of dollars when there's at least one appraisal that shows that it was worth
*  $30 million.
*  Wow.
*  And what role does the attorney general allege that Eric Trump played in inflating the value
*  of Seven Springs by that huge magnitude?
*  So what they're trying to show is that Eric Trump is the one behind this specific valuation,
*  that he was the one who informed the finance department at the Trump Organization of this
*  value, which Letitia James is saying is an inflated value.
*  And do they have evidence?
*  What we're seeing is a lot of communication between Eric Trump and a member of the Trump
*  Organization Finance Department that sure makes it look as if he was involved in talking
*  about this very subject and maybe even telling this finance department member who is literally
*  requesting the valuation from him what the number should be.
*  We don't have a smoking gun here.
*  We don't have the moment he told me the valuation, I told him the valuation.
*  That's not in evidence, but there's enough to really make it look like the attorney general's
*  accusation that Eric Trump was involved in this valuation could be true.
*  And what does Eric Trump say about all of that circumstantial evidence when he gets
*  on the stand?
*  He refuses to accept the logic of it.
*  He refuses to bend to it.
*  And as he's asked more and more about it, he clearly gets frustrated.
*  And what he starts to say is, look, I'm an operator.
*  I'm a construction guy.
*  I don't deal with these little kind of petty financial details.
*  That's not my role at the company.
*  Even if the emails suggest that in fact he might.
*  In fact, he probably did deal with these financial details.
*  So how does this all shake out to you watching in the courtroom?
*  Well, even though Eric Trump is so different in his demeanor and his affect from Donald
*  Trump Jr.
*  I was reminded of this exact same principle.
*  This is not important, even if I was involved with it.
*  And if my involvement here or there, you can show it with evidence or you can suggest it
*  with evidence.
*  Well, ultimately, that doesn't matter.
*  There's a kind of a take my word.
*  I know how this works.
*  You clearly don't thing going on here.
*  Yeah.
*  And that just doesn't necessarily help his case.
*  Right.
*  So then we get to Donald Trump himself.
*  Tell us about that testimony.
*  For some reason, I had thought that Donald Trump would be a little bit different on the
*  stand than he is at a political rally in an interview because the stakes are really high.
*  And in short, he wasn't.
*  He was a very familiar Donald Trump.
*  He was outraged.
*  He was prone to giving long, non-responsive monologues, much as he often doesn't answer
*  to reporters.
*  He lashed out at the judge.
*  He lashed out at James, who was sitting in the courtroom.
*  And it's not just that he's being Trump.
*  It's that he's being Trump in such a way that's really kind of harmful to his overall case.
*  He's talking about how involved he was with the financial statements that he did, in fact,
*  ask for values to be changed.
*  He is talking about his desire for his valuations to be higher than they're generally perceived
*  to be.
*  Kind of admitting to the very fraud, it sounds like, at the center of the case.
*  Sometimes he's admitting to parts of the fraud, or at least to his involvement in them.
*  But even when he's not doing that, his need for the public to know that his properties
*  are incredibly valuable is on display in so much of his testimony.
*  So we talked earlier about the triplex apartment.
*  Right, the one where he tripled the value of the triplex.
*  That's right.
*  It's 10,996 feet.
*  So at some point, Trump is asked a question, basically, how big is that apartment?
*  And he starts out by saying it's 11,000 feet.
*  Which is accurate.
*  11,000 square feet.
*  That's accurate.
*  But then he says, or 12,000, 13,000.
*  He just starts going up.
*  It was like he was doing exactly what he was accused of doing on the witness stand in front
*  of the judge.
*  He sort of can't help aggrandizing and exaggerating this real estate portfolio of his.
*  That's what it seemed like.
*  It seemed as if so often he was being asked questions that infuriated him.
*  So I'll give you a good example.
*  The judge, as we've talked about, has already ruled that these values were fraudulent.
*  And Trump should be doing everything he can to just get away from these statements.
*  I had nothing to do with them.
*  I don't have an opinion about them, et cetera.
*  But sometimes the attorney general's questions just seem calculated to rile him up and he
*  can't do that.
*  He can't do that distancing.
*  Kevin Wallace, the attorney general's lawyer, asks, you don't agree with the position of
*  the office of the attorney general that the values are overstated in the financial statements.
*  And instead of saying, you know, I hope they weren't overstated, but I don't really have
*  anything to do with them, Trump lashes out at James.
*  I think she's a political hack, is what he says in response to that question.
*  Got it.
*  And that can show you how his anger almost trips him up.
*  Rather than being very careful on the stand, he goes wherever it seems his id takes him.
*  Black fury, I think, in the political setting has been useful for him, has made people
*  feel like this guy speaks out for me, he's with me, et cetera.
*  That's not the case here.
*  Anger makes you lose control.
*  It makes you overstep lines.
*  And overstepping lines in a court case has really serious consequences.
*  Right.
*  And rather than being, it's not like you're saying very strategic, Trump misses an opportunity
*  to state unequivocally, I don't agree with those valuations or those valuations might
*  be wrong or, like you said, put some distance between them.
*  His anger overrides what might be a strategic instinct to better serve himself as a defendant.
*  That's exactly right.
*  When you see someone on the witness stand, you expect strategy, you kind of expect to
*  see in their conduct what their lawyers have told them about that appearance.
*  There were so many moments on Monday where we didn't see that, where we didn't see preparation,
*  where we didn't see strategy.
*  It sounds fair to say, correct me if I'm wrong, that by the end of this testimony from
*  Eric, Donald Jr. and Donald Trump himself, that this case is not going very well for
*  them.
*  It wasn't going very well for them the minute they entered the courtroom, but it sounds
*  like it's not going any better after their testimony.
*  It's hard to imagine that this testimony helped them.
*  And it's very easy to imagine little bits and pieces of it showing up in the attorney
*  general's closing.
*  Here's where he said this.
*  Here's where he said that.
*  Here's Donald Trump exaggerating that triplex again on the stand.
*  It seems to me that it was not helpful to their case and it may have been quite harmful
*  to it.
*  It feels like we learned something very important in this testimony about former President Trump
*  as a witness.
*  And it's what you said, which is that he's kind of heedless, incautious.
*  And I have to imagine that that is a fact that prosecutors in all the other cases in
*  which Trump as a defendant are thinking about.
*  They want Trump on the stand.
*  If I were a prosecutor and I saw what happened on Monday, I would absolutely want the former
*  president to testify in my case.
*  And of course, the question for future cases is, will his lawyers advise him to behave
*  differently?
*  Will he listen to them?
*  And will they now try to keep him off the stand?
*  It was so clear on Monday that he did not understand the pulse of the courtroom.
*  That makes it tick.
*  If I'm one of Trump's criminal lawyers and I see what happened on Monday and two of his
*  criminal lawyers at least were in the courtroom, I really try hard to keep him off the stand.
*  Well Jonah, thank you very much.
*  Of course.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, is scheduled to testify today.
*  The trial is expected to last for the next few weeks with a final ruling possible sometime
*  in December.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Who should govern Gaza when this is over?
*  I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, will have the overall security responsibility
*  because we've seen what happens when we don't have it.
*  In an interview on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ABC News
*  that Israel would play a major role in overseeing security in Gaza when its ground invasion
*  is completed.
*  When we don't have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror
*  on a scale that we couldn't imagine.
*  The remarks immediately evoked memories of Israel's original occupation of Gaza, which
*  began in 1967 and ended in 2005.
*  The United States has strongly opposed such a reoccupation, but in the interview, Netanyahu
*  did not specify what his plan for securing Gaza would actually look like in practice.
*  And Democratic candidates and causes won big victories on Tuesday in off-year elections
*  held in several states.
*  In Kentucky, the popular Democratic Governor Andy Beshear was re-elected in a deeply Republican
*  state.
*  In Ohio, which also leans Republican, voters approved two ballot measures, the first enshrining
*  abortion rights in the state's constitution, the second legalizing marijuana.
*  And in Virginia, Democrats kept control of the state Senate and were on the verge of
*  winning control of the House of Delegates, blocking the state's Republican governor
*  from trying to restrict abortion.
