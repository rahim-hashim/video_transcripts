# The End of An Era for U.S. Womenâ€™s Soccer
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPAMqmRsVSI)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is a daily.
*  A few days ago, when the U.S. women's team was eliminated from the World Cup, it marked
*  the end of a history-making run of victory.
*  But according to my colleague Rory Smith, it also marked the end of something even bigger
*  an entire era that redefined women's sports.
*  It's Friday, August 11th.
*  Where are we exactly in the tournament right now?
*  This is really confusing for me.
*  So it's Friday in Australia and New Zealand when they start, which I think is still Friday
*  in the U.K., but might be Thursday.
*  Thursday in the U.S.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And I can't do the three jumps.
*  Two global time jumps is kind of all the brain can sustain.
*  Well, as we're hinting at, you are in Australia covering the waning days of the Women's World
*  Cup, and you are graciously tolerating this ungodly time difference of 14 hours from all
*  of us here in New York.
*  I want to ask you to go back a little bit in the tournament, hit rewind, and reconstruct
*  the final moments of this game that has already become sports legend, the United States versus
*  Sweden.
*  Countdown is underway.
*  So it's a game in the round of 16, so the first knockout round of the World Cup.
*  Sweden, number one, USA.
*  And to be honest, it kind of played out as we thought.
*  It was very tight.
*  There wasn't a huge amount of action, which maybe fits certain stereotypes that certain
*  people still have about soccer.
*  It was tense.
*  Turns it back upfield.
*  It's pushed.
*  And you could feel the nervousness of the players and, to be honest, of the crowd building
*  as the clock ticked.
*  Pre-kick US.
*  It's getting chippy.
*  And then, as these things tend to do when nobody scores, it goes to penalties.
*  That's it.
*  Penalty kicks are going to determine who will go on and who will go home in this incredible battle.
*  Right.
*  And that's what I want to talk about.
*  So you start off with five kicks each, and the first two kicks for both teams are scored.
*  And the US scores its third, and Sweden misses.
*  Which means that the US have to score, hit the ball and the goal twice.
*  You are through to the quarterfinals of the World Cup.
*  You know, you get to stay in the competition.
*  You're still in the tournament.
*  You're still favorites.
*  And up steps Megan Rapinoe.
*  Sire Williams on the US bench as Rapinoe steps up to take the next kick.
*  Now, Megan Rapinoe famously doesn't miss penalties.
*  You know, she's one of the most experienced players on this US team.
*  She's arguably still the brightest star in women's soccer.
*  Megan Rapinoe knows about pressure.
*  And one of her specialties is taking penalties.
*  She's a sure thing.
*  And she steps up and she looks, as she always does, incredibly cool and collected.
*  Rapinoe right foot's in, over the bar!
*  And she misses.
*  And she turns and walks back to her teammates who are all kind of gathered on the halfway
*  line with this rueful smile on her face as though she can't believe the absurdity of
*  the situation.
*  Right.
*  But it looks, fortunately for Rapinoe, like she might kind of get away with it because
*  the Swedish player who follows her also misses, which means Sophia Smith can win it for the
*  States.
*  But she misses.
*  This one doesn't even come close.
*  And you get to the situation where no one can really believe what's happening, because
*  you never see that many penalties missed in a row in a penalty shootout.
*  But even that was kind of normal compared to what followed.
*  If she scores, Sweden wins, the US is out.
*  We come to the end of the shootout.
*  The Swedes need to score one to go through.
*  And Elissa Nia, the American goalkeeper, saves the shot.
*  But instead of the ball spinning away from the goal as it normally would, it spins quite
*  slowly back towards the line.
*  Nia, because of her incredible reflexes, manages to save it again.
*  Nia walks out of the goal, shaking her head, pointing to the referee saying, I've saved
*  it, I've saved it.
*  Hurtig, the Swedish player, is pleading with the referee that it crossed the line.
*  Unfortunately, no one has to make that case because the referees wear a special watch,
*  which is connected to goal line technology, which tells them if the ball has crossed the line.
*  And the whole world is kind of standing still here, waiting for the call.
*  Waiting for a watch to buzz.
*  And eventually it does.
*  And a second later, Hurtig is celebrating, the Swedish player, and Elissa Nia has got
*  a thousand yard stare, and Sweden are through in this impossible fashion, and the United
*  States are out.
*  Right.
*  And at this point, viewers at home are absorbing the idea that the US has lost, and they have
*  lost by literally a millimeter.
*  Well, the thing that struck me the day after it is that the US was knocked out by a unit
*  of measurement the country does not recognize.
*  They were knocked out by 0.04 inches.
*  Thank you for the translation.
*  So, Roy, once you pick your jaw up off the ground after these excruciating mistakes by
*  the US women's team, and this loss, what are you thinking?
*  I suppose the first thought that you have is that it felt like the end of an era.
*  The US has been the defining force in women's soccer realistically for 30 years.
*  But particularly over the last 10.
*  They've won the World Cup twice.
*  They have been home to the biggest stars, the most famous players.
*  They have developed a profile that I think exceeds the bounds of athleticism and goes
*  into advocacy and activism.
*  They have always given the impression that this is kind of their tournament.
*  But the idea that the US are the default winners, the champions in waiting, that is over not
*  just for this tournament, but for maybe every tournament from now on.
*  So what you're saying is that the era of inevitability is what's really over for women's soccer.
*  This team is now fallible.
*  They can now fail, and they have.
*  And with that in mind, Roy, tell us the bigger story of how this women's team ever became
*  so dominant, what the dominant era represented ultimately, and why it's now ending.
*  That's a big question.
*  So I think for a long time, the US had a kind of systemic advantage in women's soccer.
*  Bear in mind, this is a sport that was outlawed, as crazy as that seems to say.
*  It was banned completely in Britain at a kind of professional level until the 1970s.
*  It was banned for women.
*  Women were not allowed to play professional, organized soccer in Britain until the early 1970s.
*  In the US, Title IX, which was passed in the 1970s and made provision for the equal treatment
*  of men's and women's sports, certainly at the college level, meant that there was an
*  organized form of women's soccer being played.
*  They were at colleges that had coaching staffs and training programs and played competitive
*  games in competitive leagues.
*  And that means you get a pipeline of talent.
*  So when FIFA get round to organizing a World Cup for women, the first official one is in
*  1991.
*  The US are kind of unmatched.
*  They are the standard bearers, the pioneers of women's soccer.
*  But that's not the moment that makes this team, this program, so significant.
*  That comes in 1999, when you have this starburst that gives not just US soccer, but kind of
*  the American sports infirmament.
*  Players like Mia Hamm, who for a long time was regarded as the finest women's player
*  in history, Brandi Chastain, this team that become genuine stars.
*  And they become genuine stars because in 1999, the two very best teams in this World Cup
*  going at it, the World Cup is held in the United States.
*  This is the biggest game in the lives of these USA players.
*  And you could say that for China, too.
*  The Americans make the final.
*  Referees just looked at the watch.
*  The winner of the 1999 Women's World Cup will be decided on penalty kicks.
*  And Brandi Chastain hates the penalty kick that beats China.
*  And go!
*  Brandi Chastain does it!
*  And the USA are world champions once again.
*  And you get this iconic shot of Chastain in celebration, taking her jersey off to reveal
*  her sports bra and kind of sinking onto the turf on her knees.
*  And after a torrid two hours of football, the USA win five four-on penalties.
*  This look of complete and utter overwhelming delight on her face.
*  Jubilation on and off the field.
*  That image goes across America, it goes around the world.
*  Those sorts of iconic images have a power.
*  They resonate with people.
*  And suddenly it feels as though women's soccer has arrived, certainly in the US.
*  And to an extent, I think you can make the case everywhere.
*  And I think that victory not only determined that that generation of US women's players
*  became certainly the first real superstars of women's soccer, but also it gave them
*  a platform and a voice and a kind of broader significance that brought them into other
*  teams that weren't necessarily just about what they did on the field.
*  Explain that.
*  They start talking about better conditions, about better pay, more equitable treatment.
*  And the US national team kind of develops this activist edge to the extent that it becomes
*  almost inseparable really from the US women's team.
*  And the most obvious impact of that, I guess, is the establishment of the first professional
*  women's soccer lead in the States, then arguably kind of worldwide.
*  Which means that the players can devote themselves to soccer in a way that isn't really available
*  to a lot of people in Europe and South America.
*  And that creates this impression really that the US is this superpower that just can't
*  be caught, that its dominance is going to be kind of almost eternal, or at least as
*  close to eternal as sport can realistically manage.
*  So what you're describing is a very virtuous cycle where the dominance of the US women's
*  team, the activism leads to things like a professional league, which cements the dominance
*  and it strengthens the pipeline and begets even more dominance.
*  Yes. And all of that coalesces in the next truly great US team.
*  It starts to beget genuine household names, players who are famous in sports and the culture
*  as a whole.
*  And that is people like Alex Morgan, the striker, and most of all, I suspect, it's Medan Rapinoe.
*  Who comes to be seen almost as the avatar of that generation.
*  And remind us what makes her such an avatar of the sport.
*  Well, first and foremost, it's how she plays.
*  She burst into kind of soccer's consciousness 2011, 2012.
*  Wonderful for Megan Rapinoe.
*  Rapinoe shot over goal!
*  She's the sort of player that catches the eye.
*  She's not necessarily the biggest or the quickest or the strongest, but she plays with a swagger,
*  which I think a lot of people are drawn to.
*  Rapinoe looking for the finish.
*  And Rapinoe provides the finish.
*  She can do no wrong.
*  I think there is an ineffable quality to stardom that you can't always really explain.
*  Sometimes, you know, some people are LeBron or Michael Jordan, they're just like loads
*  better at the sport than anybody else.
*  And so they obviously become stars.
*  But I think there are other players who tend to stand out because of something in their
*  body language, something about the way they carry themselves.
*  You need to close down Megan Rapinoe because look at that ball!
*  A sense that they might do something exciting.
*  Megan Rapinoe!
*  Live for soon!
*  We've all seen the YouTube of her playing the guitar, now we can listen to her sing as well.
*  And I think Rapinoe is in that category.
*  She is the sort of player who you kind of have to keep an eye on because you never quite
*  know what she's going to do.
*  And that's Rapinoe on the field.
*  But increasingly, as her profile grows, she actually becomes as significant really for
*  what she does off the field as what she does on it.
*  Like what?
*  Well, particularly initially, LGBT rights.
*  Why would I ever not come out?
*  Why would I never not take this stand and say this is who I am?
*  And I'm very proud of that.
*  She came out in 2012, she's one of the first openly gay players, if not the first openly
*  gay player on the US women's national team.
*  And then in 2016...
*  Several star soccer players on the US women's national team have filed a lawsuit demanding
*  equal pay.
*  Together with a few of her teammates, Rapinoe leads this legal battle against US soccer,
*  her employers effectively, to try and achieve pay equity with the men's team.
*  And it takes a long time, the legal kind of procedure is very complicated.
*  But they do eventually force US soccer to change the way that players are compensated.
*  Megan Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem before her game last night with the Seattle
*  Reign.
*  And then later in 2016, she becomes one of the first professional athletes outside of
*  the NFL to kneel in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick's protest against racial inequality.
*  She told reporters, being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and
*  not have it protect all of your liberties.
*  And you know, that's a risk, because if you look at what happened to Kaepernick, he was
*  effectively forced to sacrifice his career to make his principles clear.
*  And a lot of athletes have been told not to do it, organizing bodies didn't want them
*  to do it.
*  And Rapinoe did it anyway.
*  Well, two days before her women's national team takes on France in the quarterfinals
*  of the Women's World Cup, co-captain Megan Rapinoe is in another match with President
*  Trump.
*  Most notably in 2019, around the time of the World Cup in France, she doesn't have any
*  problem at all with standing up to the President of the United States.
*  Traditionally, a winning team would be invited to the White House so that the president of
*  the day can bask in their reflected glory.
*  And Rapinoe says, she will not go.
*  To which Trump responds, maybe Rapinoe should win first.
*  You have to finish the job first.
*  And that's what the Americans do.
*  They get all the way to the final and against the Dutch in Lyon.
*  Rapinoe scores the decisive goal that means the US have retained the World Cup.
*  And when they get back to the States...
*  I stand by the comments that I made about not wanting to go to the White House, with
*  the exception of the expletive.
*  My mom will be very upset about that.
*  Rapinoe and the entire team don't go to the White House.
*  I would encourage my teammates to think hard about lending that platform or having that
*  co-opted by an administration that doesn't feel the same way and doesn't fight for the
*  same things that we fight for.
*  She makes it very clear that she does not approve of anything that Trump is doing and
*  that she will not allow him to use her stardom to make himself look better.
*  And of course, there's real risk here for Rapinoe and for the entire team in taking
*  on someone like Donald Trump.
*  Yes, Rapinoe and the entire team really found themselves in a more central role in a kind
*  of ongoing broiling culture war than I think they probably anticipate or than many people
*  would have said is ideal.
*  That's never really been something that has concerned Meghan Rapinoe, I think, that she
*  is absolutely willing to stand up for what she believes in, regardless of who that might
*  antagonize or alienate or upset.
*  If there's a cause that she believes is worth fighting for or a cause that is close to her
*  heart or something that she feels she should stand up for, she will stand up for and she
*  will use the platform she's got.
*  And Rapinoe was always very clear that all of that was contingent, because while sport
*  is a great way to discuss things that people might not want to discuss, to discuss things
*  that they might want to avoid, it all depends on how successful you are.
*  If you are winning games, if you are winning trophies, if you are one of the best players
*  in the world, if you are a world champion, then people kind of have to listen to you.
*  They want to hear what you've got to say.
*  Rapinoe has always said that first and foremost, you have to win the stuff that people care
*  about and that is what gives you your platform.
*  And now after all those years and years of winning, the US women's soccer team has now
*  lost.
*  Yeah, for the first time in more than a decade, it has lost a World Cup game.
*  It looks like the end of an era and it looks also like the rest of the world has kind of
*  caught up.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Roy, how does the rest of the world manage to catch up to US women's soccer?
*  I think the first step was unbanning the sport.
*  That was quite helpful.
*  And then what you really see probably starts 10 to 15 years ago, where the major club teams
*  of Europe start to take an interest in women's soccer.
*  And you see the major teams of the Premier League and of the top divisions in Italy and
*  Spain and Germany belatedly.
*  And it's really important we don't cast anyone here as the good guys because this was in
*  the 21st century.
*  This is the sort of thing I should really be describing from like the Victorian period,
*  but it's not.
*  This is the 21st century.
*  But these clubs know exactly how to produce footballers.
*  They are extremely good at it.
*  They're also extremely good at finding footballers.
*  And they have the brilliant light bulb moment of, if we can do this for men, it'll probably
*  work for women too.
*  What you see is within the clubs themselves, you see all of these facilities suddenly populated
*  not just by boys, but by girls that you get players who are recruited to youth academies
*  at the age of 10, 11, sometimes earlier.
*  This seems slightly uneasy saying it, but if there's a talented kid playing soccer somewhere
*  in an organized setting in Europe, the local professional team will know by the time they're
*  six.
*  Wow.
*  Like we're all finished after six.
*  If you're already spotted by the time you're six, you are done.
*  But it is a machine.
*  It is a talent spotting and a talent creation machine.
*  And you see this rapid growth in women's soccer that the European teams get better and they
*  get better really fast.
*  Right.
*  And the US of course does not have a comparable system.
*  No, the US is a complete outlier in global soccer.
*  And in women's soccer, there is a real issue with pay to play that women's soccer in the
*  US has always been kind of a middle class pursuit.
*  And because of that, it's obviously a little bit exclusive and that has this effect of
*  limiting the number of players who can have access to it.
*  And at the same time, the place that leads isn't to professional teams, it leads to colleges
*  and the colleges provide good quality coaching.
*  It's a professionalized environment, even if it's not fully professional.
*  But that's at what 18, 19?
*  And competing with European and South American and to an extent even African kids now who
*  have been trained professionally at professional elite teams since they were 10 or 11.
*  That's an awful lot of catching up to do for someone who's 18 or 19 and going into college
*  that there is a natural disadvantage to that US system when it's exposed to global competition.
*  So once Europe decides to really invest in this pipeline for women's soccer, whatever
*  advantages the US had with systems like Title IX, they basically evaporate.
*  Yeah, and it evaporates really fast because the European clubs can move so quickly and
*  with so much money.
*  So you start to see really since the 2019 World Cup in France, which is obviously one
*  that the Americans won, it starts to feel even there like the gap is closing the aura
*  that they had the sense of fear that they inspired in European teams, the idea that
*  was the final boss in a video game that you had to beat the American national team.
*  That starts to dissipate.
*  And I think coming into this World Cup, there was a real sense among the European teams
*  and for the sake of being able to walk around safely, I should say Australia, the US team
*  was kind of there to be taken down that they weren't what they used to be.
*  And that there was nothing to be afraid of anymore.
*  And so what does this year's World Cup look like when that US aura begins to dissipate?
*  Well, they kind of arrived here knowing that for quite a few of the players, this would
*  be their last hurrah or what they hoped would be their last hurrah.
*  You know, Megan Rapinoe was retiring.
*  She has already announced that several of the members of the team are in their mid to
*  late 30s.
*  And without wanting to be ageist, that tends to mean that you are in the autumn of your
*  professional athletic career.
*  They probably won't come back either.
*  And to be honest, they kind of look like a team that's at the end of a road.
*  You know, they played four games, they beat Vietnam, they drew with the Dutch and with
*  Portugal.
*  And PS, when you say drew, two stupid Americans tie.
*  Yeah, they tie, sorry.
*  But they never really looked particularly exciting or imaginative or inventive.
*  They didn't feel like they were the defining story, the must watch draw of this tournament.
*  They felt like a faded force.
*  They looked a shadow of what the world expects from the United States women's team and what
*  the US women's team expects from itself.
*  Right.
*  And that extends quite clearly to the final game that you described at the beginning of
*  our conversation against Sweden when Rapinoe misses her penalty kick and Sweden's last
*  penalty shot goes in by that painful millimeter.
*  Yeah, and there was a temptation in the immediate aftermath to see it as being a really close
*  run of thing that the World Cup had been ended by a millimeter.
*  But that's not really true, because that millimeter was just a culmination of all of the rest
*  of the tournament, which in turn was the culmination of all of the last four years.
*  And that in turn probably would link to the growth of women's soccer around the world,
*  to the inevitable march of time for some of the most important players on the US team.
*  So it wasn't unforeseeable that the US should not win the World Cup.
*  It wasn't really an injustice that they went out to Sweden.
*  The only thing that struck me as being particularly cruel was the fact that Rapinoe, with her
*  last ever kick at a World Cup, should miss a penalty.
*  That felt like it wasn't really the code of her World Cup career deserved, given all that
*  she's achieved for the sport as a whole and in terms of the causes that matter to her.
*  And she expressed all that after the game.
*  I mean, this is like a sick joke.
*  For me personally, I'm just like, this is dark comedy, I missed a penalty.
*  He called it a sick joke that that would be her final contribution to a World Cup.
*  I think this team has always fought for so much more.
*  And to know that we've used our really special talent to do something that's really changed
*  the world forever.
*  I think that means the most to me and the players in this locker room here.
*  And she talked about how she's tried to use the platform that the US national team provides.
*  That's the best part.
*  We're going to miss you.
*  Thank you, Megan, for everything.
*  Thank you.
*  And she has always said that without the winning, you don't get the microphones, you don't get
*  to say whatever you want all of the time, because people in Rapinoe's telling, listen
*  to winners, they want to hear what winners have to say.
*  And in her view, if you don't win, then that might go away.
*  Right, she seemed to recognize that this platform is now in jeopardy.
*  I wonder, Rory, to the degree that the era that we've been talking about truly is over,
*  based on the pipeline and Europe's success in building it that we've been talking about,
*  it might be over for some time.
*  The US might not be able to catch up to Europe's catching up to the US for years.
*  Maybe it will be impossible to catch up.
*  We're not going to know that for a while.
*  But I'm curious, what do you think that this era of extraordinary dominance and success
*  and activism will have meant with US women's soccer?
*  Well, first of all, I think that maybe the US will just have to get used to being one
*  of several nations that can win major tournaments.
*  And there's no great shame in that.
*  I don't think the US is going to be bypassed as a soccer force.
*  They will be back.
*  They might win the next World Cup.
*  But I think the era of them being default champions is probably over for good.
*  There will always be other countries that can challenge them now and challenge them
*  in a convincing, consistent way.
*  What I don't think will change is the kind of spiritual, philosophical legacy of this
*  team that women's soccer all over the world has an activist edge.
*  And I think in no small part, that's because most of these women have had to fight for
*  something, the right to play, the right to be paid as much as they deserve, the right
*  to have access to the same facilities as the men, the right to have their sports projected
*  in the way that it ought to be.
*  So women's soccer is always accompanied by a degree of advocacy.
*  But to me, Rapinoe and this generation of the US national team, I think they were the
*  embodiment of that.
*  And I suspect that they inspired quite a lot of people within women's soccer to stand up
*  on the issues that they believed in.
*  I mean, it's been really interesting here in the last week or so to see how defensive
*  really players from other countries have been about the US national team.
*  I don't want to kind of cause any offense when I say that the rest of the world generally
*  quite like seeing Americans lose at things.
*  But that's not the case in women's soccer.
*  There is an abiding respect and admiration for this team.
*  They feel quite protective of the US, I think, in a way that's quite rare.
*  And that, I think, speaks to two things.
*  One is what this generation of the US national team has meant in a sporting sense.
*  You know, athletes admire winners, and this US team have been relentless winners.
*  But also, I think there's an element in there of what they've represented as people.
*  The admiration for what they've achieved, both on and off the field, will continue long
*  after we've forgotten kind of how they got knocked out of this World Cup.
*  Wolverine, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In a major diplomatic breakthrough, the United States and Iran have reached a deal to win
*  the freedom of five imprisoned Americans, most of whom have been charged by Iran without
*  evidence of spying.
*  In exchange for the Americans' release, the US will release several jailed Iranians and
*  unfreeze about $6 billion in Iranian oil revenue.
*  The release of the Iranian money could prove controversial given Iran's history of funding
*  armed militants across the Middle East.
*  But the US says that Iran will have no direct access to the money, which will be held by
*  a bank in Qatar.
*  To access the money, Iran must submit orders to the bank for humanitarian products like
*  food and medicine that have no military purpose.
*  And...
*  Tragedy that hits one of us is felt by all of us, with lives lost and properties decimated.
*  We are grieving with each other during this inconsolable time.
*  Officials on the Hawaiian island of Maui say that the recovery from the wildfires that
*  have killed dozens of people there will take years.
*  The fires have burned hundreds of buildings, including homes, businesses, hotels, a school
*  and a museum.
*  In a video posted on Thursday, Maui's Mayor Richard Bisson asked residents for their
*  patience.
*  In the days ahead, we will be stronger as a kai'aulu, or community, as we rebuild with
*  resilience and aloha.
