# The Slide Toward War in Lebanon
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Vob-vKmSs)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Last week, after the Israeli military detonated thousands of pagers in walkie-talkies across
*  Lebanon, aimed at the militant group Hezbollah, the question was, what would happen next?
*  Over the past five days, we've gotten an answer.
*  The strikes came in waves, one after another.
*  In a series of attacks across Lebanon, including in densely populated parts of its capital,
*  Beirut, those attacks sent the country into high alert.
*  Thousands of people in the south have been fleeing their homes.
*  And prompted panic among Lebanese civilians.
*  OK, there's a lot of panic.
*  People are making their way out of this area.
*  A few minutes ago, there's been another airstrike.
*  You can see the smoke.
*  As of Tuesday night, the death toll stood at more than 600, according to the Lebanese
*  Health Ministry, with more than 27,000 people in shelters.
*  Today, my colleague Ben Hubbard, on the origins of the spiraling conflict between Israel and
*  its most feared regional adversary.
*  It's Wednesday, September 25th.
*  So Ben, over the last several days, it really feels like we've come closer to an all out
*  war between Israel and the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah than we've ever been.
*  You have a long history reporting on this group and their conflict with Israel.
*  I wonder what you've been thinking as you've been watching things develop over the past
*  few days.
*  So I've been watching this conflict between Hezbollah and Israel for a long, long time.
*  And I've never seen anything like what we've seen over the last week.
*  We had pagers blow up in the hands of people across Lebanon.
*  The next day we had walkie talkies blow up and also inflicting damage.
*  Right after that, we had a very high level assassination of a senior Hezbollah military
*  leader and some of his comrades in Beirut in an Israeli airstrike.
*  And then we had more than a thousand airstrikes across Lebanon, particularly in places where
*  Hezbollah has a lot of power.
*  And we're watching this happen and then we see the death toll just going up and up and
*  up.
*  And by Monday night, it was over 500 people.
*  It included women and children.
*  And very soon we realized that this is actually the deadliest day in Lebanon for many, many
*  decades.
*  And this, of course, is very different than what we've seen over the past 11 months since
*  October 7th, which is that Hezbollah began to fire into Israel after October 7th in solidarity
*  with its ally Hamas.
*  This is taking things up to a very different and very new level.
*  Yeah.
*  Very soon after the Gaza war started, Hezbollah jumped in and started firing on Israel.
*  And the idea was to try to bog Israel down on the northern border so that it couldn't
*  focus entirely on Gaza.
*  And both sides kind of had this understanding that they would continue this battle, they
*  would strike each other, but they would try to keep things in certain bounds.
*  They try to sort of keep it confined to the border area and not sort of let this blow
*  up into a much bigger war.
*  And for many, many months that worked.
*  I mean, they basically did manage to keep it confined.
*  And so the question as we were watching this was always, what would it take for this to
*  spiral out of control?
*  And in my trips to Lebanon, talking to Hezbollah people and talking to other people close to
*  the movement, they tended to mention three things.
*  They talked about high level assassinations of Hezbollah leaders.
*  They talked about strikes directly on Beirut and not just along the southern border.
*  And they talked about the killing of large numbers of Lebanese civilians.
*  And all of a sudden last week, the Israelis carried out this massive escalation in this
*  battle and very quickly checked all three of those boxes.
*  And why is that?
*  What changed?
*  Well, there's a few reasons for this.
*  One is that there's a lot of political pressure inside of Israel on the leadership.
*  You have somewhere around 60,000 Israelis who have fled their homes in the north because
*  they're worried about getting hit by missiles fired by Hezbollah.
*  So there's a lot of pressure on the political leadership to find a way for these people
*  to return home.
*  And then as far as we can tell, the capabilities for some of the early attacks, specifically
*  the pager explosions and walkie talkie explosions, had basically been set in motion a while ago.
*  And we have reporting suggesting that Hezbollah had discovered this and the Israelis sort
*  of realized they needed to use this or they were going to lose it.
*  So those two elements came together and we've had this astounding series of attacks on Hezbollah
*  that have changed the entire shape of this conflict.
*  Right.
*  There's been this barrage of rocket fire and bombings, including in Beirut.
*  And everything we've seen so far has indicated that there are a lot of Lebanese civilians
*  caught in the crossfire.
*  What are the Israelis saying that they're doing here?
*  Well, before all of this started on Monday morning, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  put out a video that was addressed to the Lebanese, telling them basically that Hezbollah
*  has been using them as human shields, putting rockets near their homes, sort of dragging
*  them into this war and that all of these rockets are a threat to Israel.
*  And so Israel was going to come in and try to take out this military infrastructure.
*  And he asks the Lebanese to basically get out of the way.
*  Say if you are anywhere close to anything that has to do with Hezbollah, you better
*  leave.
*  Which is probably very little solace for those families who've actually been affected by
*  this.
*  We don't necessarily know where a Hezbollah installation is, but why this move away from
*  Gaza when Hamas is the one that attacked Israel on October 7th?
*  For a very long time, Israel has regarded Hezbollah as one of the largest threats on
*  its border.
*  And even before the Hamas attack last October, Israeli officials were much more worried about
*  Hezbollah than they were worried about Hamas.
*  And so this has been something that kind of has been in the air for a very long time.
*  People in the Israeli security establishment have sort of felt like we're eventually going
*  to need to go and kind of take care of this Hezbollah problem and sort of get them off
*  of our border.
*  And now it seems like they've at least taken very, very significant steps in that direction.
*  And it's still unclear how far it's going to go.
*  I mean, it's already gotten to be much, much bigger than it was.
*  And now everybody is wondering what's next.
*  Is there going to be continuous airstrikes trying to take out Hezbollah's infrastructure,
*  military infrastructure?
*  Or is it possible that the Israelis are going to launch a ground invasion?
*  OK, so now that an all out war between Israel and Hezbollah is a real possibility, including,
*  as you say, potentially even up to an invasion of Lebanon.
*  I wonder, Ben, if you could explain the broader context for all of this.
*  How did these two start fighting in the first place?
*  So as it turns out, the conflict actually dates back to a ground invasion of Lebanon.
*  They said they didn't want to take Beirut unless they had to, but they came.
*  In the 1980s, Israel invaded.
*  They crossed the border in 1982 to try to get militants off of their border.
*  And they stayed.
*  They basically set up a military occupation of the south of the country.
*  The Israelis said they had one goal, to root out once and for all Palestinian bases across
*  the border from their northern settlements.
*  And the Shiite Lebanese, who were a majority in the south, weren't very happy to have them there.
*  And so a group forms that came to be known as Hezbollah.
*  Hezbollah guerrillas launched two salvos across the border from Lebanon, retaliation, they
*  say, for Israel's shelling of south Lebanon on Friday.
*  Which was at the time an underground resistance force trying to get these invaders off of
*  Lebanese soil.
*  And they did this with the help of Iran, which provided them with support and funding.
*  And it worked, basically.
*  From now on in Lebanon, May the 25th will be a holiday, the National Day of Resistance
*  and Liberation, to celebrate the departure of the Israelis from the south.
*  They became a very effective guerrilla force, attacking Israeli forces.
*  And in 2000, the Israelis packed up and left.
*  And for Hezbollah, this was a huge victory for them and something that was noticed across
*  the rest of the region.
*  And they didn't stop.
*  They continued to expand following an ideology of the resistance, which in their terminology
*  is this sort of shared vision of these forces across the region coming together to ultimately
*  destroy Israel.
*  And this is very deeply rooted in religious ideology that they share with Iran.
*  And it kind of guides them forward.
*  And I should mention that Israel, the United States, and other countries consider Hezbollah
*  a terrorist organization.
*  So at this point, Hezbollah has emerged as a clear antagonist to Israel.
*  What's the next kind of flashpoint in this fight between these two adversaries?
*  So Hezbollah continues to develop its role in Lebanese politics, its military capabilities.
*  And in 2006, some of its fighters launched a cross-border raid on Israel.
*  They killed a number of soldiers and they captured two and bring them back to Lebanon.
*  I'm calling to the people who kidnapped him.
*  Send us a sign of life for my son.
*  And this sets off gigantic, devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah.
*  A very bloody one, as I remember, as I covered it.
*  Yes.
*  Israel had to respond to this absolutely unprovoked assault whose scale and depth was unprecedented
*  in recent years.
*  Israel pummels south Lebanon and lots of Lebanese infrastructure across the country in airstrikes
*  launches a ground invasion, tries to come back in.
*  Since the beginning of the war, there have been virtually no supplies being brought into
*  Lebanon.
*  That means that Lebanon, to all intents and purposes, has been shut off from the outside
*  world.
*  And this drags on for about 34 days.
*  More than a thousand Lebanese are killed.
*  About 150 people are killed in Israel.
*  Hugely, hugely destructive war.
*  The head of Hezbollah pledged to wage an open war against Israel.
*  And Hezbollah shows itself to be an incredibly capable guerrilla force.
*  Forces inside Lebanon fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli border towns and a warship.
*  They have tunnels dug in south Lebanon.
*  They have bunkers.
*  They use a lot of the landscape.
*  They basically wait for the Israelis to come into these towns and villages and then sort
*  of pop up out of nowhere, fire anti-tank missiles, lay ambushes.
*  And it's incredibly effective.
*  They reach a point where neither side figures they can go much further.
*  And it brings the war to a stalemate.
*  And even though Lebanon has been devastated by this war, Hezbollah walks out of it looking
*  like heroes.
*  Once again, instead of being sort of the scrappy force that fought the occupation, now they're
*  one of the few forces in the region that can say, we stood up against the Israeli military
*  and stop them from even coming in.
*  Yeah, I remember watching those Hezbollah fighters emerge from the trenches on the day
*  that Israel withdrew.
*  And they were really walking with the confidence of victorious men.
*  Despite the fact that there had been massive casualties on the Lebanese side, they really
*  were acting as though they had won.
*  Yes.
*  And this has an effect inside of Lebanon and in the broader region.
*  Inside of Lebanon, their military forces get stronger and more effective.
*  And they start to evolve into what a lot of people have called the state within a state.
*  They have their own TV station where they broadcast the news basically of how they see
*  the world.
*  They start providing widespread social services, mainly to their poor people in sort of their
*  base community.
*  And they begin to play an even stronger role in Lebanese politics, participating in parliamentary
*  votes and government formation and things like that.
*  And they just start becoming a bigger part of the mix.
*  And Lebanon has an incredibly weak central state.
*  This is a country that suffered a terrible, terrible 15-year civil war that it basically
*  never recovered from.
*  So it does have an army, but the army is not incredibly powerful.
*  And Hezbollah is just basically not subject to anybody's control.
*  They never have to ask permission from anybody to do what they want to do.
*  So they have members in parliament and they usually have a handful of people in the cabinet.
*  But that's not what they're really interested in.
*  What they're really interested in is their broader military project.
*  And they basically draw a very clear line around their military activities and they
*  will not let anyone else get involved or tell them what to do or not to do.
*  Okay, so that's on the domestic front.
*  But you mentioned that the 2006 war and its outcome really had an effect on the broader
*  region as well.
*  So what was that?
*  So Hezbollah's performance in the 2006 war really puts them on the map regionally.
*  There's people across the region who are used to basically Arab armies being humiliated
*  by the Israelis.
*  And then all of a sudden this militia stands up and stops the Israelis from invading their
*  country.
*  And so they kind of developed this aura as this kind of people's army.
*  And you start seeing people flying Hezbollah flags and putting up pictures of Hassan Nasrallah,
*  the leader of Hezbollah.
*  You would see it in Cairo.
*  You could see it in Damascus.
*  People that are against Israel and might feel that their governments are not doing enough
*  to sort of work against Israel.
*  And then all of a sudden you have, wow, this is the real resistance.
*  And that really raises their stock across the Arab world.
*  And they run with it.
*  Hezbollah goes through basically another transformation.
*  And instead of just being a force focused on fighting Israel, they expand into the rest
*  of the Arab world.
*  They start intervening in regional conflicts, sending their people abroad to help out other
*  militias.
*  And this is when things start to backfire.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Ben, what does it look like when Hezbollah expands its footprint in the Middle East?
*  Tell me about that.
*  So you'll remember that from the early days, Hezbollah is very close with Iran.
*  And Iran has this idea of the axis of resistance.
*  The axis of resistance is supposed to be this network of forces throughout the Arab world
*  that are opposed to the United States and that are opposed to Israel and are trying
*  to push back on their interests in the region.
*  So these forces exist in different countries.
*  And Hezbollah is kind of the senior member.
*  They're sort of like the older brother of all of these other militias.
*  Everybody looks up to them and sort of see them as this experienced party that can kind
*  of help them get their act together.
*  And after 2011, this axis starts to take off.
*  And Hezbollah is really the connective tissue.
*  Hezbollah starts sending out experts and they start sending out fighters.
*  In less than a year, Hezbollah has turned the tables for Syria's once beleaguered president
*  Bashar al-Assad, their Shia ally.
*  They get involved in Syria's civil war.
*  They go to try to help the government of Bashar al-Assad put down a rebellion against his
*  rule.
*  The group is now perceived as killing Sunni civilians inside Syria on Iran's request.
*  And they train fighters there and they work alongside them.
*  And many of them participate in battle.
*  We may not have spoken about Iraq before, but we have a little...
*  Later they send fighters to Iraq.
*  They send fighters and trainers to Yemen.
*  Let's go to any place where we can fight this threat that is threatening our Muslim nation
*  and our region.
*  So they're kind of freelancing in a way around the Middle East.
*  Yes, yes, exactly.
*  And many of the Arab governments are watching this happen and sort of wondering why this
*  group that claims to be focused on fighting Israel is suddenly popping up and trying to
*  help Iran out.
*  And worse than that, Hezbollah is actually killing other Arabs.
*  They are fighting on behalf of the Syrian government and they're killing people on the
*  other side.
*  And so it begins to tarnish Hezbollah's regional standing and its regional reputation.
*  So that's a very big shift in a very short period of time for Hezbollah.
*  Yeah, it's a big shift.
*  And there's a somewhat similar shift that takes place around the same time inside of
*  Lebanon.
*  Lebanon, as I said before, has an incredibly weak central state and the country basically
*  starts to fall apart.
*  A tragedy is unfolding in Lebanon.
*  Inflation has driven the country's currency to historical lows.
*  The economy starts falling apart.
*  The banking system begins to fail.
*  Attacks on banks everywhere and people demanding their money.
*  They've been locked out of their accounts since the financial crisis began in late 2019.
*  People are going to the banks and trying to get their money out and the banks basically
*  say we don't have your money anymore.
*  Wow.
*  The state electricity network has again collapsed.
*  A lack of fuel forced Lebanon's largest power stations to shut down.
*  There's an electricity crisis where people are going for days without electricity.
*  I mean, it gets to be very, very miserable and it creates a lot of anger against this
*  political establishment that's been ruling Lebanon for a long time.
*  So in 2019, a protest movement begins to try to get rid of them.
*  Almost 1.5 million people, that is a quarter of the population, have taken to the streets
*  over the last five days.
*  People chant revolution, revolution, we want the fall of the regime.
*  People pour into the streets, they come out in downtown Beirut and in other cities basically
*  calling for a toppling of the regime.
*  We need to get rid of these people who've been running our country because they've done
*  such a terrible job.
*  And interestingly, many of them consider Hezbollah as part of this establishment.
*  People come out and they chant against Hezbollah the way that they chant against the other
*  political parties and they very much see them as players in this corrupt system that has
*  brought the country to this kind of breaking point.
*  So in other words, by 2023, Hezbollah is much diminished.
*  And yet when it comes to October 7th, when Hamas attacks Israel, Hezbollah behaves very
*  much in a way that is not diminished.
*  It actually starts attacking Israel in solidarity with Hamas.
*  Why does it do that?
*  So this actually fits in very well with Hezbollah's sort of more recent activity of trying to strengthen
*  this axis of resistance, trying to work with these other anti-Israel forces in the region.
*  So Hamas attacks Israel, Hamas is a member of the axis of resistance.
*  Israel goes to war with Hamas.
*  And Hezbollah says basically, we need to help Hamas out.
*  And that's what gets us into what we saw over the last 11 months, this sort of low boil
*  war along the Lebanon-Israel border.
*  And then all of a sudden we hit this last week and it all falls apart.
*  Israel launches this massive escalation and Hezbollah doesn't seem to have seen it coming
*  at all.
*  Walk me through what Hezbollah's response has been so far.
*  In terms of statements, it's been largely defiance.
*  Hezbollah leaders have come out, they've promised to keep fighting, they've promised to get
*  vengeance against Israel for these attacks.
*  Militarily, it's been more of the same.
*  They are still launching missiles and rockets across the border at Israeli targets.
*  There has not been significant damage or significant casualties reported on the Israeli side.
*  And I think everybody sort of expected that because of Hezbollah's capabilities, if something
*  like this happened, they would be able to mount a really large response and they haven't.
*  And people are still trying to figure out exactly why that is.
*  Is that because they're just unable to do it, either because too many of their people
*  on the border have been wounded or killed?
*  Is it because they can't communicate enough to organize sort of a broad attack?
*  Or is it that they're kind of wishing that they could take things back to the way that
*  they were last month, where, you know, they can have this war going with Israel and they're
*  hitting things, but it's not sort of escalating into this gigantic war.
*  So just tying all of this together, Ben, what do you make of Hezbollah's position here?
*  The group is just in a much different place than the sort of hero status that it used
*  to have when it was the one standing up to Israel and winning.
*  They are in a much, much different place, both in the region and in Lebanon.
*  In the region, I think that there's a lot of sadness about the civilian deaths in Lebanon.
*  And I think people are very concerned about the damage that's being done in Lebanon.
*  But you hear much less sort of sadness about Hezbollah.
*  I don't see a lot of people sort of mourning that Hezbollah has taken these hits.
*  And I think that's because there were a lot of people in the region that were sort of
*  fed up with what they had been up to.
*  And inside of Lebanon as well, I think that, you know, there had always been this idea
*  that Hezbollah is there to defend us from Israel and to resist against Israel.
*  And but during this war, you know, there were definitely a lot of Lebanese who sort of asked,
*  why did you get us involved in this?
*  Why are you dragging Lebanon into Hamas's war?
*  And so I think people are worried about what Israeli action could do, whether there's going
*  to be a ground invasion, how that's going to be terrible for the country.
*  But I don't think that is a lot of people worried about what it means for the future of Hezbollah.
*  So, Ben, is it possible that given all of this, you know, Hezbollah's weakened stature
*  domestically and in the region and their loss of key leaders in these most recent round
*  of attacks, that there might actually be a real chance here that Israel could achieve
*  its goal of incapacitating Hezbollah, this threat that they fear most?
*  It's very hard to predict where this is going, but I can throw out a few ideas.
*  It seems quite clear that Hezbollah today is not what it was, that it has been hit incredibly
*  hard as an organization on multiple levels.
*  This includes taking out many senior leaders with lots of experience.
*  This includes taking out a lot of middle management, and it includes hitting the rank and file.
*  And so really across the structure, this is an organization that has taken a deep, deep
*  blow.
*  And from what we've seen so far, they're either not capable or choosing not to respond militarily
*  to what the Israelis have done.
*  So that suggests that the organization is damaged and that it could be more difficult
*  for them to move forward.
*  But in terms of the question of, you know, has Israel achieved or could it achieve what
*  it sets out to do?
*  I think that's a much different question.
*  Israel has tried to get quiet on its northern border by invading Lebanon before twice, and
*  it has not worked.
*  And if you make a comparison with Hamas, Israel has been at war with Hamas now for 11 months.
*  Hamas is by all accounts a less sophisticated, less experienced fighting force than Hezbollah.
*  They're also basically trapped inside of Gaza.
*  They have closed borders.
*  They can't move in and out and bring equipment in and out the way that they would like to.
*  And Israel has still really struggled to try to destroy this organization as they set out
*  to do.
*  Hezbollah, on the other hand, is more sophisticated.
*  It has the open borders of Lebanon to rearm, to move fighters and to do other kinds of
*  logistics.
*  So even though serious damage has been done to this organization, it's premature to conclude
*  that we've reached its demise.
*  Ben, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  On Wednesday, in a sign of defiance, Hezbollah fired a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv, the
*  first time the group had fired so deeply into Israeli territory.
*  The missile, which Hezbollah said was aimed at Israel's intelligence agency, was ultimately
*  shot down by Israel's military and caused no damage or injuries.
*  Meanwhile, Israel's attacks into Lebanon continued.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  My fellow leaders, let us never forget, some things are more important than staying in
*  power.
*  It's your people.
*  In his final speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Biden
*  made a full throated defense for America's continued involvement in conflicts in Europe
*  and the Middle East, framing his four years in office as part of a vital effort to safeguard
*  democracy.
*  When Russia invaded Ukraine, we could have stood by and merely protested.
*  Vice President Harris and I understood that that was an assault on everything this institution
*  is supposed to stand for.
*  Speaking on the United States defense of Ukraine against Russia's invasion, the president
*  said that America and its allies had, quote, ensured the survival of Ukraine as a free
*  nation, but warned that Ukraine's power to hold off Russia could be fleeting.
*  Innocent civilians in Gaza are also going through hell.
*  Thousands and thousands of kills, including aid workers.
*  Too many families dislocated, crowding in the tents, facing a dire humanitarian situation.
*  On the Middle East, Biden made a point of highlighting civilian casualties in Gaza and
*  said Israel and Hamas should sign on to his ceasefire and hostage plan, while also reiterating
*  his long-held position that Israel has the right to defend itself.
*  But he refrained from weighing in with specifics on Israel's actions in Lebanon, saying only
*  that his administration was, quote, determined to prevent a wider war, and that even as the
*  situation had escalated, he believed that a diplomatic solution was still possible.
