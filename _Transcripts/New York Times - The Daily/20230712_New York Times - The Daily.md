# The Great Resignation is Over
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9KFjzwja9s)
*  Previously on The Daily.
*  How big was your staff pre-pandemic and how big is it now?
*  So in February I believe we had about 13 employees.
*  Now it's six of us.
*  Pre-pandemic we had a staff close to 50.
*  Wow.
*  What are you at now?
*  I have 30 now.
*  Over the past two years, tens of millions of Americans quit their jobs.
*  You know, I started thinking like, well, why am I really doing this?
*  It felt very liberating.
*  I was able to rediscover and discover things that I never really did for myself.
*  Is this really serving me or is it just serving, you know, whoever my employer is?
*  It was a tidal wave that became known as the Great Resignation.
*  For now, I would much rather take my time and try to find a situation where there's
*  stability and security.
*  Once I took stock of my life, I was like, I've never, ever, ever.
*  They're gone.
*  Ever.
*  They're not coming back.
*  Never going back to that.
*  I think a lot of people are like, I've had it.
*  I'm done with it.
*  I can't do it anymore.
*  I think it's a wake-up call.
*  Now that era of quitting is over.
*  I'm Natalie Kittroweth.
*  Today my colleague Ben Castleman on what its end means for workers.
*  It's Wednesday, July 12th.
*  Hi, Ben.
*  Natalie.
*  Ben, this is so fun.
*  This is the first time we've done a daily together.
*  I'm genuinely really excited.
*  I can't believe it.
*  Reunited.
*  It feels so good.
*  So back in 2021, you did an episode with us where we heard from all of these people who
*  had left their jobs.
*  And then just last week, I saw that you wrote a story saying that that phenomenon, the great
*  resignation, had ended.
*  What did you mean by that?
*  So what I mean by that is that we had this period coming out of the pandemic of just
*  rapid-fire job switching across the American economy.
*  And we can measure this directly because the government, the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
*  measures how many people quit their jobs every month.
*  And that measure went through the roof coming out of the pandemic, and it stayed through
*  the roof for months and months to an unprecedented level.
*  At the peak, four and a half million Americans a month were quitting their jobs.
*  But now it is coming down, and it has gotten pretty close to where it was before the pandemic.
*  So I think we can safely say that the great resignation, whatever it was, is over.
*  And what are we supposed to make of that?
*  Why do we think that's happening?
*  Well, look, I mean, one possibility is that workers moved around and found jobs that they
*  were happier with and that paid better so they don't need to keep moving because they
*  got a job that they like.
*  And I'm sure that for some people, that is what happened.
*  But I think what's more likely in the economy as a whole is that a lot of workers are starting
*  to feel nervous.
*  You know, we've been hearing for a long time now about the risks of a recession.
*  I mean, we've talked about this on The Daily many times.
*  Workers are aware of that.
*  They're hearing these warnings.
*  They're seeing that the economy is not booming along the way it was coming out of the pandemic.
*  And so I think we're starting to see evidence of workers getting just a little bit more
*  cautious and not feeling like, oh, they can just walk out the door and get something else.
*  It sounds to me like, honestly, in order to understand why the great resignation is over,
*  we kind of need to understand why it happened in the first place.
*  Can you explain that to us?
*  Yeah, I'm glad you asked because I think that this phrase great resignation, honestly, I've
*  never liked it very much because I think that it calls to mind a picture in a lot of people's
*  heads that really doesn't reflect what was going on in reality.
*  How so?
*  You know, I think you hear great resignation and you think about people who are privileged
*  white collar professionals who after the pandemic are rethinking their priorities or it's young
*  people who, you know, just want to go and live van life in the country.
*  And look, I think that did happen.
*  We saw quits rise pretty much across all industries and all demographic groups.
*  But that's not most of it.
*  That's not where it's concentrated.
*  To a large degree, the great resignation was a phenomenon of low wage workers, of service
*  workers in hospitality, in leisure, in retail.
*  That's where the weight of the quitting was.
*  Can you remind us why they were quitting?
*  So I think it helps to wind back the clock a bit to the pandemic period.
*  We saw businesses shut down, especially in-person businesses and lay off millions of workers,
*  most of whom go on unemployment benefits, which expanded significantly in the pandemic.
*  So that by the time we get to the spring of 2021 and vaccines are being rolled out,
*  businesses are reopening, people are going back to restaurants and hotels and retail
*  outlets, all these businesses suddenly need workers.
*  And for workers who were in these industries at that time, this was a pretty miserable
*  moment, right?
*  This is when it still feels really unsafe in a lot of cases to do this work.
*  It's a time where they're being asked to enforce mask mandates and are often getting a lot
*  of pushback on that.
*  And look, that's only one of the reasons why the supply of workers was constrained.
*  You know, childcare was still disrupted, so a lot of people couldn't return for that reason.
*  The borders were still, by and large, sealed.
*  So we lost out on what is usually a major source of low-wage work in this country, which
*  is immigration.
*  And so for all of these reasons, we had a ton of demand for workers as we all rushed
*  back out into the world and not that much supply.
*  But Ben, can I ask you, what about unemployment benefits that people were getting during and
*  after the pandemic?
*  How did that play into any of this?
*  It's a really important question.
*  You know, one of the major policy tools that the government used during the pandemic was
*  expanded unemployment benefits.
*  For a while there, you were able to get an extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits.
*  And this was done explicitly to try to give people an option not to work, right?
*  This is at the heart of the pandemic.
*  We wanted people to be able to stay home and be safe.
*  Those benefits continued in a somewhat reduced form after the economy began to reopen.
*  And we began to hear a lot of businesses complaining that they couldn't find workers because the
*  workers were out there receiving unemployment benefits.
*  We certainly know that unemployment benefits did give workers some more leverage in this
*  situation, right?
*  They didn't have to come back to the first job that was offered to them because they
*  had a way of paying their rent and of buying food.
*  But we also know that the quitting that we've been talking about here actually continued
*  to increase after those extra benefits expired, after they went away.
*  What we're seeing is workers quitting their jobs to go, in some cases, start businesses
*  of their own or to change into other industries that maybe are more attractive to them at
*  that point, or in many cases, to go into other businesses in their same industry.
*  And so what we're talking about here, this great resignation period, it can't be about
*  unemployment benefits, right?
*  Because it continued to grow after the unemployment benefits went away.
*  What does that tell you, Ben?
*  What was happening in the economy that explains that?
*  What it tells me is that this was still a moment of really intense demand for workers
*  and that it became a real moment of worker power.
*  These businesses wanted workers, they needed workers, and a lot of workers had moved on
*  and gone on to other industries.
*  And as a result, the workers who were left behind had some leverage.
*  They had the ability to say, I'm not going to come work for you if you're going to pay
*  me the $12 an hour that you were paying me before.
*  I think there's also an important element of psychology, of workers discovering a power
*  that maybe on some level they already had, but now they knew about.
*  Once they had quit a job to go take another job, maybe it's not as hard to do it a second
*  time.
*  Maybe they can go to their boss and say, listen, you know how you hired me away from somewhere
*  else?
*  Someone else can do that.
*  So you better give me that dollar an hour raise.
*  I think we had a real sort of bubbling up of worker consciousness that they held some
*  power in this negotiation.
*  And that fundamental power shift, does it have an impact on the economy?
*  Can you see it play out?
*  You can see it clear as day.
*  The most obvious place is in wages.
*  What we saw in this period was pay for these low wage workers going way up.
*  I think over a two year period, we saw something like a 28% increase in hourly earnings for
*  hotel and restaurant workers, which shows that employers really needed workers and they
*  were willing to pay for them.
*  And Ben, put that into context for me.
*  How big of a deal is that increase in wages, given what we have seen over the last several
*  decades in the US economy?
*  It's a sea change.
*  I've been covering economics for 15 years now.
*  For as long as I've been covering this, we've been talking about wage stagnation and how
*  wages, especially for the lowest wage workers, have just been stuck.
*  And all of a sudden, they came unstuck.
*  We saw wages for low wage workers rise faster than for any other group.
*  And it actually reduced in a significant way the inequality, the gap between what the highest
*  earners make and what the lowest earners make.
*  Economists have been studying this.
*  And over the last couple of years, we've reversed about a quarter of the 40 year increase in
*  earnings inequality.
*  That's obviously not 100% of it or close to it, but it's a really big bite to take in
*  just a two year period.
*  And now, you've told us, the quit rate is almost back to where it was pre-pandemic.
*  This period, this great resignation, is over.
*  Yeah, the period of quitting, the great resignation period, seems to be by and large behind us.
*  And so I think that the logical question now is whether this moment of worker power is
*  also behind us.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Ben, before the break, you hinted at the fact that the increase in earnings, especially
*  among low wage workers, might not last with the end of the great resignation.
*  Tell me about that.
*  So all of these gains that we've seen, they've basically come as a result of a really hot
*  labor market, right?
*  Of lots of demand for workers, outstripping supply, giving workers leverage.
*  But inevitably, at some point, the labor market will not be so strong, right?
*  Unemployment will rise, we'll hit a recession, whenever that may be.
*  And nothing has happened to lock in these gains so that these gains will persist beyond
*  just a strong labor market.
*  What could we have done?
*  So your answer to that, of course, is going to depend on your political perspective, your
*  approach to the economy, right?
*  Folks on the left are going to point to things like the minimum wage.
*  Wages across the country are now far above, in practice, wages are far above the federal
*  minimum wage of $7.25.
*  But the federal minimum wage hasn't gone up.
*  And so the moment that the economy gets weaker, employers could just try to pay that $7.25
*  an hour minimum wage again.
*  We haven't seen policies to make it easier for workers to organize.
*  We haven't expanded unemployment benefits, for example, in a way that gives workers an
*  opportunity to hold out for a better job if they lose their job.
*  So we haven't seen sort of any of the kind of policies that folks on the left think would
*  help strengthen workers' power in some more enduring way.
*  And we haven't seen any of the policies that folks on the right might point to either.
*  As a general rule, people on the right are less likely to see inequality per se as a
*  problem.
*  But there are certainly steps that they would like to see the government take that they
*  argue would help workers over the long run.
*  Things to make it easier to start a business, things to make it easier to change jobs by
*  lowering licensing requirements, for example.
*  We haven't seen those kinds of policies either.
*  And so what we're left with here is a system that just depends on the strength of the economy,
*  that isn't dependent on any policies that would help kind of lock in these gains.
*  What you're saying is that neither side, not the left, not the right, no one has been able
*  to take advantage of this moment where workers had real leverage to put in place policies
*  that would have made some of these gains more permanent.
*  Yeah, you might think that this would have been the moment to do that.
*  If you ever think it makes sense to raise the minimum wage, it would make sense in a
*  period where real-world wages have outstripped the minimum wage to such a degree that it
*  literally wouldn't cost businesses anything to raise the minimum.
*  If you think that there are policies that would help workers, it sort of makes sense
*  to put them into a place during a good economy, not to wait around and try to do it in the
*  middle of a recession when businesses are trying to survive.
*  But we haven't done any of that.
*  Why not?
*  Well, look, if you talk to folks in the Biden administration, for example, they'll point
*  to all sorts of things that they've done that they would argue will help the economy and
*  help workers in the long run, right?
*  Their infrastructure bill, for example, all of these kinds of policies that they argue
*  will make the economy stronger.
*  But a lot of things that they tried to do in terms of raising the minimum wage and in
*  terms of unionization policies, right, those are things that didn't get through Congress.
*  The idea of gridlocking Congress is hardly new and not something I think you and I are
*  going to solve here.
*  But it's a reality that has limited what the government has been able to do during this period.
*  So, Ben, where do we go from here?
*  So a lot is going to depend on the economy.
*  And right now, the labor market remains strong.
*  The unemployment rate is still very low.
*  We're still adding jobs at a pretty steady rate.
*  Wages are still rising.
*  They're no longer rising faster for workers at the bottom of the pay scale, but they're
*  still rising for pretty much everybody.
*  So as long as that continues, we have no reason to think workers will lose the gains that
*  they've already made, even if they're not continuing to make huge additional gains.
*  But look, the economy is vulnerable.
*  Forecasters have been predicting a recession for months now, and it keeps not coming.
*  But at some point, it may.
*  The Fed has been raising interest rates aggressively.
*  We've seen certainly a slowdown in the economy, even if it's at this point still in decent
*  shape.
*  And look, there will be a recession one of these days.
*  And because we don't have anything that has sort of locked in these gains, when that happens,
*  there's a real possibility that a lot of what workers have seen here will disappear, right?
*  If all of their leverage came from this huge demand for workers, then it's going to disappear
*  when that demand goes away.
*  So in the economy that we're in now, where there is a lot of talk of a coming recession,
*  where there's no policies on the left or the right that would keep the concrete gains going,
*  what happens to the other piece of this that you were talking about, this new sense of
*  consciousness among workers, that feeling of worker power?
*  I think in some ways that's the most interesting question here.
*  It's also in some ways the hardest to answer, right?
*  Because it's hard to measure.
*  I think there is a real sense that this period has been a wake-up call for workers and a
*  moment of real mobilization.
*  You see that in a direct way in unionization, right?
*  We've seen unionization drives at Starbucks and at Amazon.
*  We see strike activity, whether it's the Hollywood writer strike that's going on now or a UPS
*  strike that's looming on the horizon.
*  We also see it not just in this sort of classic organized labor way, but also just in sort
*  of the day-to-day activity and awareness of individual workers.
*  I talk to a lot of low-wage workers, and a lot of them tell me that this period has changed
*  the way they think about their work and their role in the workplace.
*  They've had this moment of realizing, I can go to my boss and I can say, if you don't
*  give me a raise, I'm going to go down the street and get a different job, get a better job.
*  And once that awareness exists, it changes the way they think, and it is a lesson that
*  they say they're not going to forget anytime soon.
*  But will they be able to actually use those lessons if the economy goes south?
*  If things get really desperate, if there are fewer jobs out there, how do workers use this
*  consciousness?
*  Yeah, I think it's a really fair question.
*  If most of this power came from an ability to go to your boss and say, give me a raise
*  or else, what happens when the boss chooses or else?
*  What happens when the boss says, fine, we were about to lay people off anyway, so walk
*  away?
*  If we haven't seen any real structural shifts here, and if we haven't seen any real policy
*  shifts, then I don't know why we should expect these gains to last in a period of high unemployment,
*  of few job opportunities, in a real recession.
*  That makes me wonder, Ben, what is the long-term impact then of the Great Resignation?
*  So look, workers right now are still being paid significantly better, particularly low-wage
*  workers, significantly better than they were before the pandemic.
*  You know, there's a universe here where, at the very least, workers hold on to some of
*  those gains.
*  Maybe they don't make further gains, but at least we see a higher floor for a lot of workers
*  going forward.
*  And so has the Great Resignation changed things in a lasting way?
*  Maybe.
*  If you talk to some workers, if you talk to some union organizers, they'll argue yes.
*  But I think the test of that is going to come whenever that recession hits and history tells
*  us that it will hit someday.
*  Then we'll see whether these gains hold up or if they disappear just like the Great Resignation
*  has.
*  Ben, thank you so much.
*  Thank you, Natalie.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Thank you.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  A federal judge cleared the way for Microsoft to buy Activision Blizzard, blocking an attempt
*  by the Federal Trade Commission to delay the merger.
*  The FTC failed to convince the judge that it could prove that the merger between Microsoft,
*  which makes the Xbox, and Activision, which makes video games, would reduce competition
*  and hurt consumers.
*  The ruling was the latest setback for the FTC, which has tried to become more aggressive
*  in policing big tech, but has not yet won any major victories in court.
*  And make no mistake, the devastation and flooding we're experiencing across Vermont is historic
*  and catastrophic.
*  On Tuesday, the governor of Vermont, Phil Scott, warned residents that even though the
*  rainfall that had pummeled the state had subsided, the flooding still isn't over.
*  Floodwaters continue to rise in some places, like our capital city, and have surpassed
*  levels seen during Tropical Storm Irene.
*  Rivers in the state reached some of their highest levels on record, while the authorities
*  worked furiously to reach people stranded in remote mountain towns.
*  By Tuesday, they had rescued at least 117 people from cars and homes.
