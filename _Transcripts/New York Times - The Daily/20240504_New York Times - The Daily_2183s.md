# 'The Interview': Marlon Wayans Lost Nearly 60 Loved Ones. Comedy Saved Him.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s42ajyATlIE)
*  Hey, everybody. It's Sabrina. Just popping in here to remind you that every weekend on
*  Saturday, we're going to be sending you episodes of a new show our colleagues are making. The
*  show is called The Interview. This weekend, David Marchese talks to comedy star Marlon
*  Wayans. A quick warning, there's some swearing and references to sex and sexual assault.
*  OK, here's the show.
*  From The New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm David Marchese.
*  It's not easy to make what some people might call dumb comedy, because if it were, more people
*  would have a career as successful as Marlon Wayans. Wayans broke out in the early 2000s when
*  he co-wrote and co-starred in slapsticky parody comedy movie hits like Scary Movie 1 and 2,
*  White Chicks, and my personal favorite, Little Man, which for those of you who don't remember,
*  is one in which he plays an adult masquerading as a baby. He spends most of the movie in a diaper.
*  Marlon is the youngest of 10 children, and he's a member of the Wayans family comedy dynasty,
*  which also includes his successful siblings Damon, Sean, Kim, and Keenan Ivory Wayans.
*  They all had a hand in the groundbreaking 90s sketch comedy show In Living Color.
*  Marlon went from there to later starring on five seasons of the WB sitcom, The Wayans Brothers.
*  He made all those hit movies I mentioned, and then on top of all that, he's also built a nice
*  career for himself as a supporting player in dramatic movies. But recently, Wayans, who's now
*  51, has been using his comedy to work through some much heavier topics. His upcoming stand-up
*  special, called Good Grief, is all about the death of his parents, as well as the nearly 60 other
*  loved ones he's lost in just the last few years. When I talked to Marlon, he was in Albuquerque,
*  where he was filming a psychological horror movie with Jordan Peele's production company,
*  and he was getting ready to host a party for the film's cast and crew, where everyone was
*  expected to show up in cowboy gear. Here's my conversation with Marlon Wayans.
*  Hi Marlon. What's up David? How are you? I'm good, tired. Tired from filming?
*  Yeah man, this one is a lot on the 50 year old body, 51, but it's great.
*  You said you're tired, but you're having a party tonight? Is that what I just heard?
*  Yeah, when I do movies, I like to form community and family, and so I'm having a party for my cast
*  and my crew at my house that are renting, and just kind of gathering. The fights are going to be on,
*  and just so people could mingle and roll some cigars and have some tacos.
*  Well, you know, since you're having a party tonight, a shindig, a knees up, you want to pull up?
*  It seems like a perfectly natural thing to talk about the subject of your new special,
*  which is the death of your parents. Gang gang. Isn't that crazy?
*  People are like, what's your next special? I'm like, oh, it's a really funny, hilarious journey
*  about the death of my parents. But it wasn't just the death of my parents. I lost
*  57, 58 people that I loved in a matter of three years, and it felt like biblical. You know how
*  you read things in the Bible and you go, man, that's some real traumatic stuff that person went
*  through. And then they find this light at the end, we get the lessons. And it's always through
*  tragedy. How do you find the funny thing in the sad thing? Or when did you realize that you could
*  make comedy out of these traumatic events? It's been a gift since I was a kid. I mean, all of us
*  Wayans is, we're crazy people. The worst thing happens, and the first thing we think is what's
*  funny about it. There's funny absolutely everywhere. I remember my cousin said he died,
*  and my auntie buried him on jeans, and he had a t-shirt, and some Air Force ones, and a baseball
*  cap. And me and Damon sitting over his casket, and Damon looks at me and goes, you know,
*  if there's a dress code in heaven, I don't think city's getting in. And we,
*  and people thought we were crying, but we were crying and laughing. We always look for laughs.
*  Are there elements of the new special that you can point to and say, you know, this is a kind of
*  joke or the kind of material that I couldn't have done five years ago or 10 years ago? Like,
*  what in it is evidence of your growth as a comedian?
*  I think as a comedian, I'm getting to the good stuff. This was the hardest thing for me to do,
*  to work on this material about my mom passing, and I'm still dealing with the grief
*  as my dad is on his way to transitioning. I had two shows the night my father passed.
*  I had two shows, and I pulled up to the comedy club, and I get a call, and my dad died.
*  I was like, okay. All right. Cried in the car real fast. Boom. I had a show. I didn't cancel
*  the show. I did my show, and then right there on the stage, I told the audience my dad passed,
*  and I broke down, I cried. And then I got ready for the next show. And I think I was
*  and I think in order to grow as a comedian, for me, it's like talking about the hard stuff.
*  When you talk about real life pain, like parents passing, something everybody may go through,
*  and you can get through that set, and you can find these nuances of funny, and you can still be
*  irreverent, edgy, crazy, silly, thought provoking, and vulnerable all at the same time.
*  I think that's growth. And I miss my parents dearly, but I'm a different human with my
*  parents gone than I was when they were here, because I think now I'm a man. I don't have
*  parents anymore. So I live differently, and I understand the quality of life. I want to
*  vacation more. I don't look at my phone as much. I walk. I never went outside and walked. I was
*  never a walker. I thought people was crazy. Why are you walking? Like, bro, get on the truck.
*  Every morning, I get up, and for one half hour, I go for a walk, just to clear my mind, just to think.
*  And it has me thinking in ways that I never thought before. I pray more, because when I
*  pray, I feel like I'm speaking to my parents, and that they're listening, and I let them know
*  what's going on. I report back to them, like Mork, when he used to talk to Ork
*  into the show. Very 1980s, 70s. But my identity has been concreted in the departure of my
*  legendary parents. So the key to self-improvement, it's simple. You just have to have your parents die.
*  That's a way. Sometimes they'll break you, though. You know what's crazy? My mother's death broke me.
*  It shattered me into a million pieces, because that was my girl. I never got married,
*  because I never wanted my mother to be jealous of a woman. I never wanted my mother to feel second
*  to any woman. Is that true? You know that's the reason why you never got married? Absolutely.
*  I was one of five reasons. I'll say that was number two. Number one is, I was going to fuck that up.
*  It's going to happen. Everybody that knows that I haven't been married, they say,
*  all you did was skip two divorces. And my mom was very needy. And I told my mother on her deathbed,
*  I said, I never got married, because I always wanted you to be my number one girl.
*  Those were my last words. I said, take that to heaven with you.
*  So I realize as we're talking about this, talking about your parents,
*  not really making the case that this is a particularly funny special.
*  No, it's hilarious. Let me tell you. It's about an hour and seven minutes. It's hilarious for about
*  an hour and five. And then you have spread throughout the special two to maybe three minutes
*  of heart. I'm proud of this special because I think it's going to make you feel, because I'm crazy,
*  and I know it, and I can be inappropriate, and I know it. And I'm always going to be obnoxious
*  in that way. I think in order for me to hit the different levels of comedy, you got to be somewhat
*  offensive. And I'm okay with that. But when you hit the frequency, it speaks to heart. And
*  it's so relatable. You don't think that these things that you're going through, you think that
*  it's just happening to you, but you do these sets and you're like, wow, this is happening to a lot
*  of people. You said to reach certain levels of comedy, you got to be offensive. And there is the
*  material in the special. I'm thinking in particular of the Magic Johnson AIDS material. Oh, you saw
*  the special. I saw it. Yeah. Which by the way, he has HIV, not AIDS. You should go in and redub
*  that. You know what the other mistake you make is? You call Louis Armstrong, sax player, trumpet
*  player. But it was still funny, right? Here's the thing. You can't be super on point with the facts.
*  When you're telling jokes, sometimes you just tell the jokes, man. And what's crazy is I've had
*  friends and relatives to die from AIDS. And so part of even that joke is finding humor and things
*  that happen. It's a different way to look at something tragic. And I think the world has
*  forgot how to laugh. And part of it is we're grooming people to be sensitive. But I find
*  when I'm in a comedy club, people like to laugh. They like to laugh at those dark things, the
*  magic jokes, the people want to laugh again. And I'm trying to deprogram and like get us back to
*  just laughing. So in the special, there's one magic joke I'm thinking about in particular,
*  where I understand what you're saying. You sort of have this series of jokes where you frame it like
*  Magic's life got better after he got sick. That's kind of the hypothesis of the jokes. But then
*  you throw in a line there about sex with monkeys or whatever. And that was one really where I
*  cringed. I was like, that's rough. Well, I said, show me the monkey I got next. I didn't say he
*  had sex with monkeys. I said, I don't know how he got this good version of this disease. But
*  however he got that, I want it that way. To me, that was escapism. Because it's not real. Of course
*  he didn't have sex with a monkey. If you read every joke, if you get literal, everybody's going
*  to be offended by it. There's about 72 things in that special to be offended by. I think great humor
*  is take whoever you send up, those people are laughing the loudest. And I hope that Magic laughs
*  the loudest at that joke, which he will. Magic has a great sense of humor. I hope Shaq laughs at his
*  joke. I hope all of them laugh at- Do your Shaq impression right now. Do your Shaq impression.
*  Kobe. These are friends of mine. When Kevin Hart does a LeBron hairline joke,
*  I don't think LeBron gets mad. I think part of it is it's all out there. I'm not telling no secrets.
*  This is all out there. I'm just going, here's a different way to look at it. I rescued myself
*  from depression by learning to laugh in my worst circumstances. Losing my parents
*  broke me. And I'm telling the audience, here's how you can survive this. Find humor in everything.
*  You know, the idea of the culture getting too sensitive or overly sensitive, it's something
*  that people have been talking about and have identified for a while now. And I'm just interested
*  in digging into that a little bit more, because on one hand, what we might say is too sensitive
*  could also be understood as the culture being made safe for people who didn't feel safe in the
*  culture before. Like the example that comes to mind for me is, it's one that has to do with
*  your life. You have a trans son, right? And so the sensitivity around how people talk about
*  transgender people and what they say and how we think about transgender people,
*  that is directly related to a change in the culture that allows your son to live the life
*  that he wants to live. These things are connected. So how do you see that connection? Like on the one
*  hand, what you're calling the sensitivity, on the other hand, how a culture actually changes.
*  I'm working on a beautiful hour about that, about the transition. And as a parent that went through
*  it, I think I have something to say that forwards the agenda of that kind of unconditional love and
*  acceptance for your child and for others. I went through it. And the transition wasn't about
*  their transition. It was my transition, going from like, opposing what they wanted to do to complete
*  acceptance. And it was the five stages of grief. I felt like I was losing my daughter. My daughter
*  was dying in my eyes. And so I speak about this from a true perspective. And I take you through
*  the five stages of grief and midway through the act after denial, after anger. And when I get to
*  bargaining, that's when the whole set flips. Because the people that are angry and in denial,
*  they're all on my side as the parent at first. And I'm talking in complete ignorance,
*  because that's what a lot of people are. And then the whole set takes a complete 180.
*  Because it's about me getting to acceptance. And I become a cautionary tale
*  for the people that may be going through this, of how you can get through this. Try to get to
*  acceptance as quickly as possible. It took me all of a week. That's all. It sounds like a busy week.
*  It was. It was. Well, I was like, no, you can't do this. You can't do that. I'm not supporting it.
*  I was that guy. I was that guy. And I'm ashamed to say it. Because in my eyes, I was protecting
*  my child. Now understanding that all I was doing was creating distance. And that's not fair
*  to them. Who the F am I to stand in this person's way and tell them what's right for their life?
*  I'm a parent. And the only thing I can do as a parent is be an example to love my child and
*  hope that other parents do the same. So did your experience with your son
*  and understanding what your thought process was, the five stages, you know, and how you
*  reacted to what pronouns does your son use? He and they. Right. So reacting to what they
*  were going through. Did that change or affect your thinking at all about comedy and
*  who gets made fun of when and how and when to push buttons? Yes and no. I think a comedian
*  has the right to do have their point of view, just as people have their right to have their
*  point of view. I don't get offended by anybody's humor. I think the Don Rickles did a lot of
*  racist jokes, but man, he was really funny, really funny races. I'm part comedian, right? So
*  before I'm even like black or a man, I'm a comedian. I'm all for comedians developing
*  their point of view, no matter how ignorant, small, inconsiderate, dark. They have to do this
*  because if nobody tries to find the funny, then society is missing out on humor.
*  There are certain comedians, I'm thinking of, you know, Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, where it
*  seems like to them, material about transgender people, it's the taboo that they need to keep
*  pushing at to show that they're willing to push at a taboo. I don't think it's the taboo that
*  they're pushing it. They just want to say what the hell they want to say. And what you to tell me
*  what I can say and not say. Dave is a friend of mine. I have a trans child. I'm not going to
*  not be Dave's friend because of his point of view. I went to see his shows. We've had several
*  conversations about things. He knows I have a trans son, but that doesn't change the fact that,
*  hey, you got to outwarn this that he wants to do from his point of view. And he has every right to
*  do it. Me and my child had this conversation and they understood, you know, they may feel that way.
*  But I said as a comedian, he has every right to say what he wants to say and try to find the humor
*  in what he's saying. I don't think his intention is to make you feel bad. I think he's just trying
*  to protect his right to say what he feels. We don't have to think alike. You're still my friend.
*  I learned from you. There's things I learned from you. And hopefully through conversations,
*  we could come to the fence and agree on and disagree on some things, but we affect change
*  in each other. And that's life. And I think we have to learn to laugh again. We're heading to a very
*  sad place when we can't laugh anymore. But you know, it's fine. I really think the idea that
*  we don't laugh anymore is just fundamentally wrong. Like I think, you know, if you take social media
*  as an example, so it would be just joke after joke after joke, like funny meme after funny meme.
*  To me, the question is really like, what are those jokes saying? And are they-
*  – Who's telling the joke?
*  – Who's telling the joke and what are they trying to convey with the joke? I think that
*  feels to me like the more germane question or the-
*  – People don't tell the same jokes they used to at work. They don't sit,
*  there's no water cooler talk anymore. You know what I mean? It's like-
*  – When's the last time you were at a water cooler? What do you know about water cooler?
*  – I got one in my house.
*  – Was your assistant laughing at your jokes? Oh, good for you.
*  – No, but I think like even now when you walk on sets, it's like everybody's tight. Nobody wants
*  to offend. Nobody wants to say anything. Nobody wants to- we're a bunch of robots just walking
*  around. There's no joy. That's why I love performing on a stage because it's a reminder to me that
*  people still want to laugh. There's nothing like that elation that you get. It's a high that you
*  get when you don't know if this joke that I'm about to say is going to offend everybody or
*  they're going to walk out or they're going to boo me or they're going to hate this. And then you
*  tell it and everybody cracks up and you're like, whew. It's just when you get into the corporate
*  setting or you go sometimes when you go home, it's safety again. But now, even then, you can't say
*  that. You can't say that. You got your kids telling you, dad, that's inappropriate. That's
*  inappropriate to you, you little fucker. To me, it's perfect. I pay the rent here. I'm going to
*  say what I want. It's okay for me to be inappropriate. My inappropriateness has paid for your college.
*  You know, you talked earlier about changes in kind of what's considered funny or what we expect of
*  comedians. And I was thinking about that in the context of your hit movies, you know, which come
*  out of the tradition of like Mel Brooks films or Zuckerman, Abram Zuckerman films. Those were hits.
*  Those were moneymakers. You know, you made them cheap and you made a lot of money on them.
*  But those kinds of films are also really not in vogue anymore. And it seems to be like both in
*  standup and in just in film comedy. Generally, there's always the idea that the comedy has to
*  be kind of like about something in addition to being funny. Like it can't just be a funny movie.
*  It also has to be about a larger theme. And I'm curious to know like why you think
*  the kind of comedies that you made your name with fell out of vogue. What's changed?
*  Well, if you look at Hollywood for the past 10 years, there hasn't been a lot of comedies,
*  period. Because Hollywood, everything is cyclical. They were chasing the superhero. They were chasing
*  the blockbuster. And I'm very patient because they're going to make comedies again.
*  But I think the people that's going to make the comedies are the people that know how to make the
*  comedies. They keep trying to make like these like scary movie. The audience is like, that don't
*  taste like the Wayans. I'm not going. Because they know we know how to tell these jokes.
*  There's a family recipe that we've had. You can't replicate what we do. It's just we know you can
*  have all the seasonings. You don't know how much to put on it. Wait, are you are you? Is the new
*  scary movie that they just announced that irritating to you? No, I mean, you know,
*  it's not the first time we've, we've heard it, you know, so, you know, they want to waste $50 million
*  go for it. Do you get a check from that? No, that's a that's a whole nother conversation.
*  I like to say that, you know, those Weinsteins, they,
*  they wasn't just, they, they, they raped everybody.
*  Not the same business wise, not the same business wise, literally and business wise. They, they,
*  we all got a little bit of a little taste. They, there was some terrible, terrible people.
*  Uh, good example of an offensive joke. Depends on the audience. Damn, Dave, you sensitive.
*  I'm gonna take you to a Ricky Gervais show and a Dave Chappelle show though.
*  So I'm gonna sit next to you and watch as you go, Oh God.
*  Wait, do me being sensitive in a white guy voice. Oh God, you can't say that. Christ.
*  Jesus. Hey, Christ. That's inappropriate.
*  You know, it's crazy. What's crazy, Marlon? Like, no, I think like even when you go on stage, right.
*  And you say a certain topic immediately. Sometimes you feel audience tighten up.
*  Yeah.
*  And then your job as a comedian is
*  to basically beat them into submission until they either lighten up or they tighten up so much
*  that you leave, they tight ass was right there and you say good night.
*  Um, just before we go, you know, I know you got to get ready for a party. Can you tell me a, uh,
*  funny party story from your life? A funny party story? Yeah. Party story.
*  I feel like you've been to a few parties. I've been to too many parties. Oh man. Uh,
*  Oh, I saw Tupac 20 minutes before he got shot. And ironically, I saw Biggie 20 minutes before
*  he got shot. I mean, it's not funny, but wow, what a coincidence. Wait, is that true?
*  In both instances? Yeah. Holy moly. That's not funny. 20 minutes from now, you make his shot.
*  Here's the thing. And then you laugh. He's a sick man. David. Uh, oh wait,
*  can I try an offensive joke on you? Go for it. So you had a 58. I just thought of this one.
*  Go for it. You had 58 loved ones. Yes. Diaries. You ever think the problem is you are you contagious?
*  They want to get the hell away from me. 58 people or wait, I can keep going. 60 if you include
*  Tupac and Biggie. Are you counting anyone that you just admire as a loved one? Like you see,
*  oh, Tina Turner died. Oh, she's just number 55. No, she wasn't one of the people. Some of those
*  people were like Chadwick was a friend. That was the hard one. Yeah. You know, I swear like
*  it's, it's crazy. Like when you think about how many people have passed this and that's what made
*  me do the special. Cause I feel like we need to laugh about it. I needed, I needed therapy.
*  It was therapy for me. I still hurt, but man, the last time I cried about my mom and my dad
*  was only on set recently. And that's cause my director, he's a sick man and he wanted to
*  insight some feelings. And he said, just think about how proud your mom and dad are of you
*  right now. And I thought about, I thought about how I showed up in their absence from my family
*  and how I was able to help bury them, help my older siblings get through, help my nephews and
*  my nieces just show up for everybody. Yeah. And I think that's what they raised me to be
*  and that's what they'd be proud of. Well, I appreciate you showing that emotion now. I can see
*  tears in your eyes and you know, I'm sorry that you're going through that, but it's really good
*  for me for this podcast. If you cry, maybe a little bit more audibly, I would really appreciate that.
*  Oh, I like you. You're going to be my friend, Dave. You're going to, you're going to be my friend.
*  But you know, thank you. Thank you for that openness. I appreciate it.
*  You just want to leave on a high note, but that was a joyful cry. I do miss them,
*  but I know they would be proud. But Marlon, I'll talk to you later this week.
*  Yes, sir.
*  After the break, I call Marlon back to revisit that Weinstein joke
*  and talk a little bit more about parenthood. I can't say what I am as a father. They can say
*  what I am as a father. And when I'm gone, I hope I left them with a whole lot of love and a whole
*  lot of memories. Whatever flaws, whatever I wasn't able to show up, I hope they forget that.
*  Hi Marlon. How are you?
*  I'm good, man.
*  So, you know, I was, I was thinking about a very specific moment from our conversation where I
*  asked you about no longer being involved with the scary movie franchise and you mentioned
*  Harvey Weinstein, who, you know, I guess you believe kind of strong armed you out of the series.
*  And, and when you brought it up, actually it was Bob and Harvey. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.
*  But it was clear you were loading up a joke and you had this pause where I think you were thinking
*  about then whether to say the joke. And I want to know if you can tell me like in your head,
*  in that moment when you have the, like the potentially offensive joke lined up,
*  what is actually going through your head in that pause?
*  Who's my audience? And I heard you cringe on the other thing, the monkey joke.
*  But I was going to say, you know, he didn't just, you know, he does this with women, he raves too.
*  Trust me, we did business with him. Yeah. So you see your response? You see,
*  did you see your response? I call that, we call that and like me and my brother,
*  we'd be in a writer's room or we'd be in network notes. And, you know, we've always been edgy with
*  our humor, always. That's just how we do it. Right. And so when people have that reaction,
*  like, Oh God, you know, little things you do. We call that, we used to call it getting on a
*  whitey bike. It was like brothers would crack up at that. But whitey bike, I don't know about that.
*  And they start peddling backwards. You know, it's funny though, I'm not,
*  I don't know if the whitey bike is actually the bike I ride on because
*  it's the bike that you said it made me laugh.
*  I'm not offended, you know, but there is the thing where it's like, when somebody says the
*  taboo thing where you go like, woof, I don't know, are you allowed to say that? But that's different
*  than taking a fence. You know what I mean? But what is taboo? When you've been in a situation
*  for me, right? Once again, I can talk about things from a different perspective. And when I talk
*  about Bob and Harvey and I say that it's because there's damage there. I can go into a whole
*  another article about the scary movie franchise. And you guys are like, Oh, I see why he said what
*  he said. Because we have been victims in that way, but in business, not physically, but in
*  business. And you know, I think a monster is a monster. And those monsters showed up in business
*  as well. Yeah. You know, in the good grief special, you talked about how you learned to be a man from
*  your dad. But I'm curious about what you learned about manhood and masculinity from your son.
*  That sometimes you have to work your femininity. It's okay to be in touch with your feminine.
*  It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to express yourself. It's okay to unstrap from your masculinity
*  and your ego. And sometimes that takes you not to, you know, to have a different approach.
*  And sometimes it's not about trying to teach them. Maybe God's trying to teach you something.
*  And so it taught me to be a lot more accepting and unconditional and even forgiving of myself.
*  It's okay to have stupid thoughts. It's okay to forgive yourself for having a point of view
*  that's not completely popular or evolved. It's okay to have those small feelings, those insecure
*  things, those egotistical thoughts. That's like, nah, I think I can control everything.
*  And then God breaks you down and life breaks you down. And when you realize that you are crumbled
*  and you're on your knees, that's when God can just whisper to you. And you're like, oh, that's what
*  you're trying to teach me. And I'm very grateful to my child. I love that baby because that's my
*  firstborn. And I can't say what I am as a father. They can say what I am as a father. And when I'm
*  gone, I hope I left them with a whole lot of love and a whole lot of memories. Whatever flaws,
*  I wasn't able to show up. I hope they forgive that.
*  You've referred a couple of times to hearing God or God talking to you. And do you remember the
*  last thing God said to you or the last thing that you remember feeling like it was coming from God?
*  For me, my God speaks to me every day. He's in everything I do, even in my jokes,
*  even in my experience, even in the darkness. God gave me a gift, which is to stay joyful
*  through dark things. He gave me a gift and I'm going to give that gift as much as I can,
*  as long as I can. And that will be my life identity. In the worst moments, I was able to
*  try and find a smile and hold my hand up through the rubble and go, hey guys, take this one with you.
*  Well, Marlin, you know, geez Louise, you got a salty mouth, but I just think you're a heck of a guy.
*  Geez Louise is my favorite. I'm going to keep you on Never Brunk. I need the white guy voice.
*  It's been a darn pleasure talking to you.
*  A darn tootin time.
*  That's Marlin Wayans. Good Grief will be available on Prime Video June 4th.
*  When reached for comment during the fact checking of this episode,
*  Bob Weinstein disputes that Marlin was strong-armed or that the negotiations were cutthroat.
