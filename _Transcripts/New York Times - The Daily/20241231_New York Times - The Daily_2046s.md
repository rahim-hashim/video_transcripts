Then, Jancee Dunn, a reporter on the Well desk, shares some of the most useful tips she has gleaned this year.

# The Year in Wisdom
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE)
*  Hey, it's Michael. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=0.0s)]
*  For our final episode of 2024, guest host Melissa Kirsch is back talking with some of [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=2.14s)]
*  our Times colleagues about the year's best advice for living well. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=8.36s)]
*  I think this one's really special. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=14.6s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=16.8s)]
*  From the New York Times, this is The Daily. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=21.84s)]
*  I'm Melissa Kirsch, deputy editor of Culture and Lifestyle. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=25.0s)]
*  2024 is coming to a close. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=30.0s)]
*  This is traditionally a time of reflection when we look back on the year that was and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  look ahead to the year to come. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=38.28s)]
*  So I'm talking with three of my colleagues whose jobs, in part, are to think about how [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=40.88s)]
*  we live and to think about how we can all live better. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  Today, the year in wisdom. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  This Tuesday, December 31st. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=53.04s)]
*  Philip Galanis, welcome. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=60.72s)]
*  Hi, Melissa. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=61.72s)]
*  How are you? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=62.72s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=63.72s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=64.72s)]
*  I'm just terrific. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=65.72s)]
*  It's the last day of the year. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=66.72s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=67.72s)]
*  So, Philip, for the past 16 years, you've been writing an advice column for the Times [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=68.72s)]
*  called Social Cues. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=73.5s)]
*  Every week, you answer questions from readers on a pretty wide array of subjects. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=75.88s)]
*  Give me a sense of that range. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=80.56s)]
*  Well, there's a ton about money. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=82.8s)]
*  There is a lot about parenting and a lot about marriage, pets, your family's finances, the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=84.92s)]
*  way your parents divide the money between siblings, the way your siblings treat you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  at Thanksgiving, the way your boss speaks to you in meetings. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=99.16s)]
*  I can't think of a human relationship that I have not gotten a question about. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=104.56s)]
*  It's everything. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=111.64s)]
*  And so it seems like you need to be an expert on everything. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=113.24s)]
*  Oh, but that is where you were wrong. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=117.24s)]
*  You really don't need to be an expert about anything. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=121.36s)]
*  And I am standing here as living proof of it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=125.44s)]
*  I really think it is not telling people, but instead listening to what they are telling [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=128.76s)]
*  you and starting at that point, helping to guide them to what might be the best outcome [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=141.68s)]
*  that we both can envision for them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=151.0s)]
*  Are there qualities that all good advice has in common? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=153.52s)]
*  What makes advice good advice? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  The mark of really great advice is listening so closely that you're almost the same person [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=162.0s)]
*  with the person who is asking for the advice. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=170.72s)]
*  In my experience, the best way to do it is not to think, what should I do? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=174.32s)]
*  But really listening to Melissa telling me about her situation and thinking, Melissa [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=180.8s)]
*  and I have this problem. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=189.92s)]
*  We share it now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=192.6s)]
*  The most helpful thing I can say to her to help her march toward a solution that's going [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=195.76s)]
*  to work for her. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=202.68s)]
*  Because the other thing about advice is the thing that works for me may well not work [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=205.12s)]
*  for you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=212.08s)]
*  It really is about rethinking the idea that we have inside of us the right answer. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=213.32s)]
*  We just need you to hear it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Really you know the right answer and the best advice that I can give is one that makes [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=224.08s)]
*  you hear what you know already is the right answer. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=231.12s)]
*  Just sort of turning up the volume on that voice inside of me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=236.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=240.44s)]
*  I don't give advice to anyone unless I hear them asking me for it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  Because often you end up hurting people's feelings inadvertently because they hear you're [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=249.8s)]
*  doing this wrong. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=257.24s)]
*  So I'm going to tell you how to do it right. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=259.04s)]
*  And that's about as unproductive as it gets. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=262.0s)]
*  So it's New Year's Eve. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=266.16s)]
*  This is the time of year when people are making resolutions. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=271.56s)]
*  Deciding how they're going to be better next year. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=272.56s)]
*  Do you have thoughts about New Year's resolutions? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=278.72s)]
*  I think for the most part if we had the imaginations to come up with resolutions that weren't so [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=280.12s)]
*  crushingly banal, getting our steps in, going to the gym more, eating fewer carbs. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=288.72s)]
*  I mean things that are joyless. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=297.56s)]
*  Punishing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  Self-punishing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=302.20000000000005s)]
*  Very puritanical. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  The most common one that I hear is about diet. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=305.12s)]
*  If you eat 10 crappy cookies, rather than saying let's reduce those cookies to zero, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  let's instead find the best cookie you can possibly find at the best bakery. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=319.64s)]
*  Let's do the legwork. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=330.12s)]
*  Let's find the cookie that is really going to turn you on and eat two of those in a week. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  If we can just do, I think if we could incorporate some more joy into our resolutions and less [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=337.88s)]
*  drudge, then they would, the gyms wouldn't all be ghost towns on January 15th. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=345.32s)]
*  If our resolution was I want to find somebody whom I will love to talk to on the treadmill [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  for 30 minutes at the gym three times a week and you make the project finding that person, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=362.76000000000005s)]
*  that's a fun resolution. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  You're deepening a friendship or finding somebody out of thin air. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  That's a good one, but it's not about the stupid steps. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  It's about finding the joy in whatever we need to do in order to make ourselves, I don't [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=380.0s)]
*  know, thinner, prettier, whatever silly thing we decide we need to be, which is generally [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=388.44s)]
*  not what we need anyway. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=395.4s)]
*  That is good advice. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=399.23999999999995s)]
*  This is why you are the authority. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  Any advice for humanity for 2025? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=406.4s)]
*  Let's make 2025 the year of listening. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=410.12s)]
*  Less talking, more listening. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  I think it really pays off and it also pays dividends and I'm going to try to listen more. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=416.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for talking with me, Philip. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=426.2s)]
*  Oh, thank you for having me in. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  It was really fun. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  My colleague Jancy Dunn writes a weekly column about wellness. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=440.12s)]
*  She consults doctors and researchers and other experts on topics like how to sleep better, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=444.04s)]
*  how to apologize like you mean it, and perfect timing for anyone who's traveling for the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  holidays, how to avoid getting sick on a flight. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=453.68s)]
*  She's here with me today to share some of the most useful things she's learned this [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=457.16s)]
*  year. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=461.0s)]
*  Hi, Jancy. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=462.0s)]
*  Hi, Melissa. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=463.0s)]
*  Okay, so I asked you to look back on your year-end reporting. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=464.0s)]
*  I'm very excited to hear what you found. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=467.8s)]
*  What have you got? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  So the first one is if you're feeling lonely, try reaching out to a mentor from your past. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=471.76s)]
*  A mentor from your past, like someone who has given you guidance like in a previous [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=478.76s)]
*  job or when you were a child. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=484.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, like somebody who has helped you in your life and maybe they don't even know how much [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=487.28s)]
*  they helped you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=492.0s)]
*  It can be a coach, a teacher, a neighbor. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=493.0s)]
*  So if they're still around, contact them and tell them how they've helped you and you [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=496.52s)]
*  may reestablish that connection. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  You already have that shared past. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=504.52s)]
*  And I have done this with my fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Manley. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=507.12s)]
*  She's in her 90s and my parents had given me a box of crap. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=510.96s)]
*  You know when they're cleaning out their house and they say to you like, here's your box [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=515.18s)]
*  of crap, I'm not keeping this anymore? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=519.14s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=520.68s)]
*  My fourth grade report card was in there and Mrs. Manley had said, oh, I think Jancy can [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=521.68s)]
*  write. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=525.76s)]
*  She may grow up and be a writer someday. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=526.76s)]
*  She called it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=528.6s)]
*  So I wrote her a letter and I basically just kind of thanked her for encouraging me because [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=529.68s)]
*  when you get encouragement like that, it put in my head, oh, wait, could I be a writer? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=536.12s)]
*  Is that even a job? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=541.72s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=542.72s)]
*  And so I told her all that and I said, you really shaped the course of my life. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=544.36s)]
*  She did. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=547.84s)]
*  And now I'm a writer and I thank you and you are a wonderful teacher. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=549.52s)]
*  And she wrote back immediately with this stationary with a puppy with a letter in its mouth. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=553.4s)]
*  And now she's my surrogate grandmother. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=558.52s)]
*  You just don't know what can happen if you contact somebody. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=561.12s)]
*  It can be really fulfilling. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=563.88s)]
*  Is there some sort of wisdom there in like reaching out to someone who knew you so long [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=565.8s)]
*  ago like they know the essential you? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=569.84s)]
*  Yes, precisely. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  There's a shorthand there. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=573.4s)]
*  There's a comfort there. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=575.02s)]
*  And the person that you are now may also connect with the person that they are now. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=576.88s)]
*  And it's just, especially when you get older, she's in her 90s. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=581.8s)]
*  I'm in my 50s. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=585.16s)]
*  We're kind of the same age in a weird way. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=586.16s)]
*  Like, you know, you're both adults or both adults. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=587.88s)]
*  And so we have a lot more in common than we did when I was a fourth grader and she was [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=590.76s)]
*  my teacher. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=594.76s)]
*  Okay, what's next? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=595.76s)]
*  Okay, next we have don't chew ice ever. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=598.04s)]
*  Don't chew ice ever. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=604.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=605.68s)]
*  As someone who very rarely chews ice, I'm going to guess that the reason why one should [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=606.78s)]
*  not chew ice ever is because one may break a tooth. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=612.28s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=615.9s)]
*  Do you have a dental background or how did you know that? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=616.9s)]
*  No, I just have like a really good gut instinct about things having to do with teeth. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=620.54s)]
*  I interviewed eight dentists and the majority of them, I think six out of eight, first thing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=626.14s)]
*  out of their mouths. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=631.86s)]
*  I said, what do you want people to know? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=632.86s)]
*  And they said, don't chew ice. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=635.42s)]
*  It was overwhelmingly their number one tip. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=637.4799999999999s)]
*  Chewing ice is notorious for causing, as you mentioned, small chips in your tooth enamel, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=641.54s)]
*  the outer layer of your tooth. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=646.6999999999999s)]
*  And these chips can develop into larger cracks that may require treatments like root canals, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=648.74s)]
*  crowns, even surgical removal of the tooth. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=655.26s)]
*  There's a terrifying phrase, right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=659.0999999999999s)]
*  And this all comes from chewing ice, which so many people do. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=661.18s)]
*  Okay, what else do you have? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=664.74s)]
*  This is about decluttering, always a hit in the early part of the year. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=666.5s)]
*  Let go of that dusty box or bag of mystery chargers and cords. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=672.46s)]
*  We all have it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=679.78s)]
*  Oh my God, I feel seen. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=680.78s)]
*  Let it out. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=683.9s)]
*  How so? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=684.9s)]
*  That bag is the most ridiculous bag of cords. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=685.9s)]
*  Do you ever subtract from the bag? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=690.78s)]
*  That's what a couple of the experts said to me. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=693.44s)]
*  Or do you just add to it? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=695.24s)]
*  Does it just get bigger and bigger? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=696.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, I always think like, well, I'm going to need these things or someone's going to [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=698.32s)]
*  need a cord. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=701.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't want to be caught without a cord. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=704.6800000000001s)]
*  So it's cords, it's chargers, it's remote controls from the Clinton administration. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  It's a bag of obsolete technology. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=711.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=713.2800000000001s)]
*  And we have no idea what any of those cords are for, but we are very, very afraid to throw [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=714.5200000000001s)]
*  them out. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  So we should just throw this bag away. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=721.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=724.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, first separate everything into piles and think of all the things in your house [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=725.1999999999999s)]
*  that have cords or chargers. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=729.7199999999999s)]
*  Go through and try them. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=731.12s)]
*  If they don't work, it's likely that they don't. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to be presumptuous. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=735.5s)]
*  Then it's time to drop them off at a place that accepts electronic waste. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=737.5999999999999s)]
*  Nice. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=743.3199999999999s)]
*  What's next? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=745.3199999999999s)]
*  I loved this one. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  If you're feeling cynical, take 15 minutes and collect moments of moral beauty. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=748.64s)]
*  Moral beauty. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  Tell me what moral beauty is. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=757.4399999999999s)]
*  That is a concept that was created by a researcher named Docker Keltner, and he wrote a book [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=759.3599999999999s)]
*  called Awe. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=766.0999999999999s)]
*  It's basically, you know, if you're losing faith in people, the world, politics, whatever, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=768.28s)]
*  he says to take 15 minutes out of your day and pay attention to the moments of kindness [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=774.62s)]
*  all around you. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=780.22s)]
*  I mean, it can be the tiniest moment. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=781.22s)]
*  It can be when you're at a store and you see two people sort of joking around in the checkout [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=783.0600000000001s)]
*  line, or when you are in traffic and somebody waves you in and you get that little rush [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=788.62s)]
*  of pleasure like, oh, thanks, and you hold up your hand, you know, you're like, ah. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=793.8s)]
*  There's a lot of that out there if you pay attention, and you really only need about [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=797.94s)]
*  and you can collect 10 things, and they kind of reset you and remind you that a lot of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=802.4s)]
*  people are good. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=808.92s)]
*  I think that I walk around a lot like a cop looking for social infractions, just like [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=810.1999999999999s)]
*  the tiny ways in which people are being rude to one another, and my antennae are always [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=815.9599999999999s)]
*  up for that. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=820.5799999999999s)]
*  And so that idea of resetting and reorienting myself, looking for those moments of beauty [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=821.5799999999999s)]
*  or where people are being kind and not paying so much attention to these tiny injustices, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=827.68s)]
*  that seems like a really worthy pursuit. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=833.56s)]
*  Yes, even, you know, this morning when I was walking to work and I was in Penn Station [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=835.88s)]
*  and someone ahead of me had held the door open with their elbows so they don't get germs, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=841.24s)]
*  you know, but it's an awkward thing to stick your elbow out like that for somebody, and [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=845.56s)]
*  I thought, hmm, it's nice. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=849.92s)]
*  I do it without even thinking about it now, kind of record those moments. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=851.52s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=856.3399999999999s)]
*  This was really great. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=857.5799999999999s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=858.5799999999999s)]
*  And Happy New Year. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=859.5799999999999s)]

*  We're going to take a little break, and when we return, lessons from 20 years of the Times' [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=867.5s)]
*  Modern Love column. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=872.42s)]
*  Twenty years ago, Daniel Jones helped create the Times' Modern Love column. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=879.5799999999999s)]
*  Every week, Modern Love publishes personal essays on love in all its forms, not just [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=884.82s)]
*  romantic love, but love between parents and children, siblings, love between friends, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=889.4200000000001s)]
*  love that's lost or unrequited. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=895.38s)]
*  Dan has read thousands of these love stories, and today he's here to tell us what he's learned. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=899.5400000000001s)]
*  Hi, Dan. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=908.1800000000001s)]
*  Hi, Melissa. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=909.1800000000001s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=910.1800000000001s)]
*  Dan, I imagine over all the years of doing this work, your perspective on love has probably [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=911.18s)]
*  changed. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=916.6999999999999s)]
*  How has this work changed the way you think about love? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=917.9799999999999s)]
*  I get asked that a lot, and I think about it a lot. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=921.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think mostly I've seen in essays, both ones that seem, you know, that are sort of [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=924.5799999999999s)]
*  successful in terms of what happens in them and not, is there's kind of a dividing line [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=929.9799999999999s)]
*  between people who continue to open their hearts and those who shut down. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=936.46s)]
*  And one is the path to happiness, and one is the path to unhappiness and regret. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=942.34s)]
*  And it's not always easy when something ends or when you suffer a real loss. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=947.3000000000001s)]
*  And to see people who continue to put themselves out there and say, like, this is my one life, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=954.22s)]
*  I'm going to make something of it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=961.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I admire that, and I feel like it's changed my life. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=963.9s)]
*  You published a piece earlier this year about what you've learned from reading and editing [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=968.9s)]
*  all these love stories. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=972.66s)]
*  One of the takeaways that stayed with me is the line, love is more like a basketball than [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=974.5s)]
*  a vase. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=978.6999999999999s)]
*  Talk about that. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=980.0999999999999s)]
*  Well, that line comes from an essay by a writer named Thomas Hooven. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=981.0999999999999s)]
*  Actually, I call him a writer, but he's a doctor and was a medical resident. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=985.3s)]
*  He'd come from a difficult childhood. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=992.22s)]
*  His fiance at the time had similarly come from a difficult childhood. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=994.7s)]
*  And they found each other and their relationship was kind of a refuge from their past family [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=998.86s)]
*  lives and their childhoods. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1004.26s)]
*  And any kind of conflict they would have was like apocalyptically threatening to that. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1006.42s)]
*  That love and his whole concept of love was peace. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1015.14s)]
*  He perhaps sensing the fragility of that broke off their engagement just a few weeks before [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1020.26s)]
*  they were to get married. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1026.74s)]
*  And he was just not long before starting his medical residency. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1028.9s)]
*  And he went off to this medical residency just devastated. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1035.7s)]
*  And how am I going to get through this? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1038.34s)]
*  And it was lonely. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1039.62s)]
*  But turned out to be kind of a boot camp for him in what real love means and that real [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1041.9s)]
*  love involves conflict and disappointment and it has to be able to absorb and hold all [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1048.42s)]
*  of those feelings. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1053.5800000000002s)]
*  It can't just be about peace and comfort. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1055.14s)]
*  And during his residency, he learns that and comes out the other end of it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1058.94s)]
*  What he says is as a more full human being and a better doctor and meets a woman where [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1062.42s)]
*  they are able to have a full relationship that he describes as being more like a basketball [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1068.74s)]
*  than a vase. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1074.9s)]
*  And it's durable and can bounce and can take a beating and a vase is something that breaks [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1076.38s)]
*  the first time you drop it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1081.5400000000002s)]
*  But looks beautiful from the outside. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1083.14s)]
*  And it resonated so deeply with me because I felt so similarly to him in my life of wanting [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1086.3400000000001s)]
*  to avoid conflict, of feeling like love should not. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1093.0400000000002s)]
*  If you fight, that means you're not meant to be together. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1097.5800000000002s)]
*  On the contrary, to be able to manage a fight and grow from it and know someone more deeply [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1101.42s)]
*  because of it is one of the main keys to a durable and lasting relationship. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1106.6200000000001s)]
*  Looking back over the archive, so many of the stories that you publish are about love [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1112.5s)]
*  that doesn't last. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1116.22s)]
*  They're about breakups, they're about one night stands, or they're about chance encounters [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1117.22s)]
*  with people that you never see again. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1121.1000000000001s)]
*  It's about the loss of love or a very fleeting love more than it's about an enduring love. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1123.14s)]
*  I'd love to talk about what you take away from pieces like that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1128.5s)]
*  There's a popular conception that a relationship that ends is a failed relationship. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1131.98s)]
*  And every relationship can have its value. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1137.74s)]
*  And to think of something as a failure because it ended, it's not fair and it's not wise. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1142.26s)]
*  It's not productive and it's not true. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1150.42s)]
*  Maybe it's what movies and fairy tales maybe tell us about what a successful relationship [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1152.58s)]
*  looks like. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1157.86s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1158.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1159.86s)]
*  I mean, at one point, I remember noticing, especially among young people, college students, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1160.86s)]
*  sophisticated college students, they still referred to Disney movies as being their inspiration [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1166.3s)]
*  in a way for what romantic love is, which all those movies end in a wedding. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1173.34s)]
*  A wedding is the achievement instead of the beginning of a deepening relationship. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1180.54s)]
*  And that's part of that misconception, these sort of scripts that we seem to play in our [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1187.66s)]
*  lives or that we feel like we need to stick to. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1192.5800000000002s)]
*  And it's not that, you know, it's the beginning of conflict. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1196.22s)]
*  It's the beginning of something that is deeper. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1199.98s)]
*  My favorite modern love essays tend to be about tiny quiet moments instead of grand [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1205.02s)]
*  gestures. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1210.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm thinking about essays like Learning to Measure Time in Love and Loss. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1211.5800000000002s)]
*  Talk to me about that piece. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1215.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1217.0600000000002s)]
*  And this is an essay by a writer named Chris Huntington. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1218.0600000000002s)]
*  He talks about this ritual with his son where they also talk each day about the best moments [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1220.46s)]
*  and the worst moments of their day. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1228.26s)]
*  And one night he's reading with his son and he's feeling distracted and probably checking [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1231.14s)]
*  his phone and just all those things where you're not in the moment. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  And he says, oh, wait, we forgot to talk about our best moment and worst moment. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1240.1000000000001s)]
*  What's the best moment of your day? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1244.54s)]
*  And his son says, this is daddy, this is. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1247.02s)]
*  I actually start to get teary just thinking about it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1250.94s)]
*  And when I read that, tears sort of sprung to my eyes and I thought about my own experiences [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1255.1s)]
*  with my reading to my son and to my daughter and the distraction that I used to feel and [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1260.2s)]
*  what am I going to do tomorrow and what do I have to do for work? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1267.1s)]
*  Just that reminder, that small moment of like, this is your life. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1270.46s)]
*  These are the important moments of your life. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1274.7s)]
*  Be in them. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1277.7s)]
*  Well, thank you so much, Dan, for talking with me today. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1287.02s)]
*  Thank you, Melissa. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1290.66s)]
*  And happy New Year to you. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1291.66s)]
*  Happy New Year to you. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1293.1000000000001s)]
*  We're going to take a short break. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1300.46s)]
*  And when we return, New York Times readers share the best advice they received this year. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1302.18s)]
*  The best advice I've been given this year. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1311.26s)]
*  The best advice I've received this year. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1314.46s)]
*  Best advice I got all year. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1317.54s)]
*  The best piece of advice I got this year. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1318.66s)]
*  My name is Zach Rosen. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1321.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm from Detroit, Michigan, and I'm currently living in Amsterdam. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1322.1000000000001s)]
*  The best piece of advice I got this year is from my friend Daniel Estrin. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1326.58s)]
*  And the advice is this. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1330.18s)]
*  When someone says thank you, just say you're welcome. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1333.06s)]
*  This is not as easy as it seems. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1338.82s)]
*  We usually say, oh no, thank you or no problem. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1340.68s)]
*  But when we actually accept a thank you with a you're welcome, I find it deeply satisfying [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1343.82s)]
*  for both parties. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1350.18s)]
*  And I think it's just a really good practice to accept thanks from someone sincerely. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1352.22s)]
*  Instead of trying harder, try softer. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1359.1s)]
*  Best advice I got all year was from a Texan who said, never crouch with spurs on. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1363.94s)]
*  What other people think of you is none of your business. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1370.22s)]
*  Surrender to the darkness. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1374.34s)]
*  You don't need to know how it's going to turn out. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1376.14s)]
*  Hi, this is Dave Breshear in New Orleans, Louisiana. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1381.98s)]
*  Best advice I got this year, I had to bury my wife after 40 years of marriage. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1394.94s)]
*  And the bedroom has been very difficult. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1402.18s)]
*  My therapist suggested bringing the dog into the bedroom. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1405.3s)]
*  I'm allergic, so it had to be in his crate. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1411.7s)]
*  But he's happier. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1414.3400000000001s)]
*  And it's transformed my bedroom into a place I can feel comfortable. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1416.18s)]
*  My best advice when helping somebody get through chemo was not one day at a time, but five [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1425.3400000000001s)]
*  minutes at a time. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1435.38s)]
*  The smartest piece of advice I've gotten is that everything is temporary. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1439.18s)]
*  And I hope that applies to the head cult that I have right now. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1445.02s)]
*  But mostly, I hope it applies to how I feel about what happened one day, which was my [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1448.8200000000002s)]
*  husband came downstairs at breakfast time and said, I owe you an apology. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1458.74s)]
*  I've treated you badly. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1464.9s)]
*  I've been seeing someone else and I love her and I want to be with her. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1466.8999999999999s)]
*  And he got in his car and drove away. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1471.26s)]
*  And I haven't seen him since. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1473.8999999999999s)]
*  We've been married for 34 years. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1477.82s)]
*  And I thought we were both happy, but apparently only one of us was. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1480.98s)]
*  So it turns out that even marriage is temporary. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1486.26s)]
*  But I'm hoping that a whole lot of other things happen that couldn't have happened unless [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1490.78s)]
*  this bad thing happened. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1497.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm Stan Perry in Houston, Texas. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1507.02s)]
*  One piece of advice I received in 2024 and that I followed all year is each day keep [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1509.86s)]
*  a list of wins. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1515.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm an attorney, so sometimes it's work related. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1517.74s)]
*  For example, ruling from a court that was significant for a lawsuit. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1521.42s)]
*  Other times it's something that may not be that significant for my career, but is very [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1527.14s)]
*  significant on a personal level. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1533.74s)]
*  For example, my parents are in their 80s and each time I talk to them, I consider to win [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1536.14s)]
*  just to be able to hear their voice and talk to them. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1541.6200000000001s)]
*  Hi, my name is Gina Luongo and I live in Toronto, Canada. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1548.66s)]
*  The best piece of advice I got this year, quite simply, is when you put on your lipstick, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1554.0600000000002s)]
*  use your finger to spread it over your lips. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1559.5800000000002s)]
*  It gives a very fresh, natural and pouty look. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1562.66s)]
*  And it's what French women do apparently. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1566.38s)]
*  I can't believe it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1568.46s)]
*  I've lived over five decades and have never tried this before. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1569.46s)]
*  It has softened the look of my face while adding some much needed colour. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1573.14s)]
*  I love it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1577.1s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1578.1s)]
*  My brother's advice, never pass up free food or drink. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1579.1s)]
*  If you focus on the wound, you will continue to hurt. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1584.1s)]

*  My name is Mel Foster and I live in West Bloomfield, Michigan. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1599.2199999999998s)]
*  A recent client, Bernie, shared this advice. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1603.62s)]
*  Never be afraid to enter into a new venture, but always be aware that you're going to pay [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1606.54s)]
*  a dumb tax. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1613.54s)]
*  You are going to try to figure out every possible roadblock that there is to your effort. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1616.1399999999999s)]
*  But when you actually get into it and actually pursue it, you're going to find there are [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1623.26s)]
*  problems that you never foresaw and it's going to cost you money. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1628.94s)]
*  And that's your dumb tax. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1633.94s)]
*  I had back trouble for most of the year. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1637.98s)]
*  My physical therapist gave me some helpful exercises, but the best advice was a simple [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1641.38s)]
*  slogan, motion is lotion. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1647.18s)]
*  The more active I am, the less my back bothers me. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1650.6200000000001s)]
*  Magic. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1654.8200000000002s)]
*  My name is Len DeCessa. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1658.94s)]
*  I live in Dresher, Pennsylvania. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1663.9s)]
*  The best advice I received in 2024 was from my therapist. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1667.6200000000001s)]
*  I was talking about issues I was having in my relationship with my wife and he said to [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1673.5s)]
*  me, you can be the safe harbor or you can be the storm, but you cannot be both. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1680.74s)]
*  And that really impacted me. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1688.26s)]
*  Matter of fact, it's on my wall in my office. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1689.74s)]
*  My best advice of the year is keep swimming. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1700.74s)]
*  And that is from Finding Nemo. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1708.62s)]
*  My friend shared that with me after the tornado that Hurricane Milton set off in my area and [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1711.82s)]
*  I got a direct hit. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1721.34s)]
*  And then the insanity of the election time and now holidays. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1723.06s)]
*  And so my new term is just keep swimming. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1728.22s)]
*  Just keep swimming. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1732.02s)]
*  My name is Tamara and I live in Edinburgh in Scotland. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1734.06s)]
*  The best piece of advice I've got this year and maybe ever is from my friend Helen, who [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1740.54s)]
*  told me don't borrow trouble. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1745.66s)]
*  Annoyingly, I've shortened this to DBT. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1748.78s)]
*  And DBT is all about not getting yourself in bits or knots or catastrophizing about [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1751.5s)]
*  things in the future that are outside your control. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1758.82s)]
*  This is Nina Miller from Portland, Maine, reporting the most sage advice I received [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1761.22s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1773.6200000000001s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1775.98s)]
*  Practice makes better. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1777.94s)]
*  For me, as a professional French horn player in an orchestra, playing the horn is really [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1784.18s)]
*  an imperfect instrument, yet we strive for perfection, which is unobtainable. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1790.02s)]
*  So having the permission to know that practice makes better was extremely liberating for [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1796.9s)]
*  me and just changed the whole way I look at my life, my work and the playing of my French horn. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1803.94s)]
*  The best advice that I received this year was from my husband. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1812.02s)]
*  We are an old couple who have decades of harmony and conflict between us. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1821.98s)]
*  Whenever we are arguing, usually over something petty, like who left the light on or put a [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1829.18s)]
*  pink shirt in the whitewash, he will remind me that we will die soon. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1834.74s)]
*  We are at that age where our conversations are peppered with sciatica and weak knee stories, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1840.48s)]
*  and the next day is not guaranteed. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1847.8s)]
*  So when we have flare ups, he reminds me of our mortality and the importance of appreciating [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  every given moment. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1858.6s)]
*  My husband and I became first time parents this year after quite a bout with infertility [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1863.28s)]
*  and had to go through several rounds of IVF. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1870.3s)]
*  So this child was very much a journey. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1874.12s)]
*  And of course people want to give parents, new parents, tons of advice, and so much of [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1877.32s)]
*  it is so kooky. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1881.68s)]
*  Sleep when they sleep, or you must have this toy, or this developmental thing. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1884.2s)]
*  But I think the best piece of advice we've received was raise the child you have, not [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1890.68s)]
*  raise the child you want. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1897.04s)]
*  My name is Nina Kalabin and I currently live in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, but I'm from [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1899.08s)]
*  New York State. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1923.6s)]
*  I just found it to be the most beautiful sentiment around. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1926.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, society and life can feel so challenging and bleak on the day to day that our natural [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1945.52s)]
*  is what grounds us to a greater being. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1952.5600000000002s)]
*  And it's something I'm profoundly grateful for and something that I want to carry with me. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoTjFVJalE&t=1955.24s)]
