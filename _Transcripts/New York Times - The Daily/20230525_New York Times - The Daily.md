# Millions of Dollars, Thousands of Robocalls and 1 Legal Loophole
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVINTc60D9s)
*  Before we get started today, I wanted to share two pieces of exciting news.
*  The first is that we here at New York Times Audio have just released an app.
*  For fans of New York Times podcasts like you, it does something very helpful.
*  It takes all kinds of shows, like Serial, The Run-Up, This American Life, The Daily,
*  and gathers them into one place.
*  And it helps you discover the new shows that we're making that you might not know about.
*  And that brings me to the second piece of exciting news, which is that New York Times
*  Audio is launching a new news show.
*  It's called The Headlines.
*  As a daily listener, you know that what we do every day is we bring you one story in
*  depth.
*  But of course, our newsroom is covering dozens and dozens of stories every single day.
*  And that's what The Headlines is for.
*  It's a short show that brings you the top stories of the day, straight from the reporters
*  covering them.
*  This week, we're sending the show right down our feed for you to listen to.
*  And after that, you can find it on our app.
*  Search NYT Audio in the App Store or go to nytimes.com slash audio app.
*  Everything in there is available to all New York Times subscribers.
*  We hope you'll check it out.
*  Okay, now here's today's show.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  A Times investigation has found that a group of Republican political operatives used robocalls
*  to raise $89 million on behalf of police officers, veterans and firefighters.
*  Today, investigative reporter David Ferenthold on how they actually spent the money and on
*  the legal loophole that allowed them to do it.
*  It's Thursday, May 25th.
*  So David, you are an investigative journalist, and you cover nonprofits and financial abuse
*  in that world.
*  And you just published a big investigation into this one group of nonprofits.
*  Tell me what you found.
*  What's the story?
*  This story really starts more than a year ago with a tip that I got from a source who
*  said, look, there's a ring of these nonprofits, not traditional charities, but political nonprofits.
*  In the paperwork, it doesn't even look like these groups are connected, but they are.
*  They're all linked together.
*  And what they do together is take huge amounts of money in donations from regular people,
*  small donations from lots of regular people.
*  And when they get that money, they don't use it at all in the way that they say they will.
*  Now this piqued my interest for a couple of reasons.
*  The amount of money potentially involved, according to the tip, was pretty huge.
*  Tens of millions of dollars was the initial direction we got.
*  The second was the kind of nonprofits involved, a political kind of nonprofit called a 527.
*  527 being?
*  So we have to get a little into the tax code.
*  I promise this is maybe the only time we'll have to go into it.
*  OK.
*  527 is an area of the tax code that creates a kind of nonprofit whose purpose is politics.
*  You can give money to them.
*  You don't get a charitable tax deduction.
*  It's not a charity.
*  But their purpose is to raise money for politics and then to spend it helping politicians get
*  elected.
*  Got it.
*  So I was curious about these groups.
*  And another reason this all piqued my interest was the way that they raised money, which
*  was through robocalls, the humble robocalls.
*  How many times have you and I picked up the phone, realized it was a robocall, and hung
*  up within a tenth of a second?
*  So many.
*  In this case, these guys had raised tens of millions of dollars from thousands and thousands
*  of donations with a robocall.
*  So how did that work?
*  So the first thing I really had to do in this story was find the robocalls.
*  What do these robocalls sound like?
*  What made them so effective?
*  And the answer, it turns out, to be really interesting.
*  Like how?
*  You think of a robocall like what tells you it's a robocall?
*  You hear either really a robot's voice or maybe you hear a voice with a foreign accent.
*  None of that is on these calls.
*  Hello, this is David.
*  How are you today?
*  When you pick up, it sounds like you're talking to a kind of weary Midwestern cop who's just
*  had a bad experience with a last caller.
*  Oh, there you are.
*  I was beginning to think everyone was ignoring me like my wife and kids do.
*  They're amazingly lifelike because they are recordings.
*  Hello, is Margaret there?
*  It typically begins with your name.
*  Carla?
*  Antonia?
*  If you have a common name like I do, they have recorded your name.
*  David?
*  Usually there's a joke at the beginning.
*  Good to hear a kind voice.
*  That last call was tougher on me than my mother-in-law's meatloaf.
*  Or one of them is like, you're harder to get a hold of than a rabbit on roller skates.
*  Oh boy.
*  Which like putting aside that that actually would not be that hard to get a hold of a
*  rabbit on roller skates, but the idea being like I've been calling you and you haven't
*  picked up.
*  You're the first person I've reached in 15 minutes and I'm pretty tall.
*  So it really sounds like a person but actually it's just a computer.
*  It's a guy behind a computer pushing buttons to play the solicitation spiel and then with
*  enough preloaded responses that you get those answers plus things like uh-huh's and chuckles
*  and everything about a conversation, but it's just a person pushing buttons on a computer.
*  Okay, so after the kind of folksy dad joke, then what?
*  Well then they get into the meat of the call.
*  I'm calling for the American Police Officers Alliance.
*  They introduce the reason why they're calling.
*  Hi, this is Richard calling for the Firefighters Support Alliance.
*  These groups are always talking about one of three causes.
*  Calling on behalf of the American Veterans Honor Fund.
*  Helping police, firefighters, or veterans.
*  Help affect real change for our veterans.
*  And then they hit you with the ask.
*  You know tragically 17 US veterans commit suicide every day and I don't know if you
*  knew but every night there are over 50,000 homeless veterans that are struggling on our
*  streets.
*  The goal is to elect officials who are working to make our communities safer.
*  They say that the donations go to helping elect legislators who are sympathetic to
*  these groups, police, firefighters, veterans.
*  As well as support assistance to the families of first responders killed in the line of
*  duty.
*  In some cases they say that giving to them will actually mean supporting the families
*  of fallen police officers.
*  So all we ask is that you just help out with whatever you think is right.
*  You know really anything that you can send back is greatly appreciated.
*  Just help out with whatever you think is fair for our heroes, okay?
*  Okay and if you're still on the line by the end of the pitch then what happens?
*  They start talking numbers and they will often suggest some pretty small amounts.
*  Our top donation levels are 50 and 35 dollars so how much would you like to donate?
*  You know they'll say the big pledge is 50 dollars the small one is 30.
*  They want you to commit to a number and they don't push very hard to get a very high number.
*  They're happy for you to give 35 or 50 dollars.
*  Can we count on your support with a very important contribution for the drive?
*  Okay so 35, 50 dollars, pretty small donations.
*  Yeah, very small.
*  But when we looked at these groups finances and added up all the money that they brought
*  in over their nine years of operations they brought in 89 million dollars.
*  From robocalls?
*  That's right.
*  More than 18,000 donations came to these groups.
*  Most of them for less than 200 dollars.
*  A lot of the donors you can see in the forums are in their 70s, 80s, 90s, they're retired.
*  So it worked again and again and again on a whole lot of people around the country.
*  We talked to a woman named Louise McConkey who lives in Puyallup, Washington outside
*  Seattle.
*  She'd given 35 different times to the five groups we looked at totaling 3650 dollars.
*  And what she didn't know was that all this money that she and so many other people were
*  giving, almost none of it went where it was promised to go.
*  The tipster was exactly right about that.
*  After I talked to Ms. McConkey we did a huge amount of reporting, we looked at 15,000 pages
*  of transactions, we did all this research to try to figure out what became of the money
*  that Louise McConkey and thousands of people like her gave and found out that only about
*  1% of their donations was used for anything like what they thought they were supporting.
*  1% went to helping politicians win elections.
*  So what happened to the rest of the money?
*  That was not easy to figure out.
*  What we had to do was go find the public filings these nonprofits had made explaining what
*  they did with the money.
*  And when we found them we realized they had reported 15,000 pages of documents.
*  And in some cases they seemed to have gone to extra lengths to make their findings as
*  hard as possible to understand.
*  For instance, they would sometimes take 6 million dollars worth of spending for over
*  a year or half a year and report it one dollar at a time.
*  Oh God.
*  One dollar on this day to this company and a dollar the next day to this company.
*  Why are they filing in these tiny increments?
*  Well one possible reason is it makes my job really hard.
*  It makes it really hard for anybody like me to try to add up all these tiny little expenditures
*  and get any real sense of what these groups are up to.
*  Interesting.
*  Okay.
*  And we found, after adding a lot of them up, that a lot of their vendors were these shell
*  companies.
*  It was really hard to figure out who the actual humans were behind those companies.
*  So after we then sort of went through corporate records to figure out, okay, who were the
*  people behind these companies they're paying?
*  That took a while.
*  But what it showed was that about 90% of these groups spending just went to pay for more
*  fundraising.
*  They just spent it on more robocalls.
*  Wait, so they spent the money they raised from robocalls to make more robocalls?
*  Yeah.
*  One of the analysts we talked to described it as an elaborate self-looking ice cream
*  cone.
*  It was just fundraising that paid for more fundraising.
*  Like that is some intense overhead.
*  Like if we're to take them at face value, right?
*  It's like, whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  This is not normal.
*  Most charitable nonprofits, most political campaigns, anybody else you could think of
*  who might be a peer for these groups sort of has an opposite relationship to their fundraiser.
*  They pay a fundraiser to raise money so they can go do something in the world with it,
*  either if you're a charity to go help the world, if you're a political campaign to support
*  a candidate.
*  This was like a fundraiser that has a nonprofit.
*  So much of the money that they raised was just consumed by fundraising that they were
*  left with almost nothing for their theoretical purpose.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  When we looked at other groups like this, other political nonprofits, most of them didn't
*  even exceed a third of their spending on fundraising.
*  Oh, wow.
*  At that point, your question becomes, well, who's running these things?
*  Who would set up an operation like this?
*  And the answer to that question was also in the spending records.
*  Turns out it all goes back to three guys who got their start in campus Republican politics
*  in Wisconsin about 2008.
*  And the leader appears to be a guy named John Connors.
*  He was a minor figure in the political empire of Scott Walker, the former Wisconsin governor.
*  He graduated college in 2008 in Wisconsin and took a few jobs working for Walker, then
*  set out and started his own consulting firm.
*  It was a big deal in Wisconsin politics, but did not have much of a national presence.
*  The other two guys, Kyle Mikely and Simon Lewis, were his employees.
*  Connors employed Lewis as a director of operations and played Mikely as a researcher.
*  So those three folks that had this connection, they sort of came up together in Wisconsin
*  campus Republican politics and then had been minor players on their own in Wisconsin politics
*  before this.
*  So how did these three go about starting this operation that you're describing?
*  Was it shady from the start?
*  Well, it starts with a group called Veterans Action Network.
*  This is a 527 group that turns up in Wisconsin in 2014 and becomes a client.
*  It starts paying John Connors' firm for political consulting.
*  Now when you look at Veterans Action Network, it makes almost no sense.
*  When you look at its filings, it claims to be a group that started to help veterans make
*  a difference in politics.
*  When you look at what it actually did with its money, it didn't do that.
*  It spent almost all of its money on fundraising.
*  It spent several hundred thousand dollars with Connors company.
*  It did nothing to help any candidate anywhere, anytime.
*  As a political operation, it was a failure from beginning to end.
*  So you ask, well, what was the point of it?
*  Why did it exist?
*  And one clue you get is from an email that Connors sent to somebody back in 2016 when
*  he says that his company created Veterans Action Network.
*  Basically that they created a company that then became their client.
*  They created their own client and started charging it.
*  For them, Veterans Action Network was a success.
*  It didn't make any difference in politics at all, but it paid several hundred thousand
*  dollars to Connors company.
*  And what you see then is that operation is mimicked on a much larger scale by four new
*  organizations that are started in 2017, all by people close to Connors.
*  They're all 527 nonprofits that like Veterans Action Network, they play on these conservative
*  causes police, firemen, veterans.
*  They raise huge amounts of money, make almost no political difference and pay a lot of money
*  to Connors and these two other guys, Lewis and Mike Lee, his associates.
*  At the end of it all, we realized that these groups, which again made no difference to
*  anybody in the world of politics, had made a huge difference to those three.
*  Their companies got more than two point eight million dollars from these five groups combined.
*  OK, so what you've uncovered here, these 527 groups raising money from regular citizens,
*  promising to spend their donations on something they care about, like police or veterans,
*  but not spending that money on the things that they care about.
*  That amounts to a kind of double crossing of the citizens, like not doing the thing
*  that they said they were going to do.
*  Surely that's illegal, right?
*  I feel like I asked that question of so many people in the reporting of this story.
*  And the answer is it might not be illegal.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, this sounds like a pretty clear scam.
*  Like how is this not illegal?
*  Well, listen, if this was a 501c3 charity, a traditional charity, it might be.
*  There are a lot of state attorneys, general and others, who think their job is to stand
*  up for donors in that situation.
*  If a donor is being ripped off, they can step in, sue you, take some sort of legal action.
*  But in the political context, for political nonprofits, there's really not a watchdog
*  to play that role.
*  These groups sort of exist in a blind spot within the campaign finance system.
*  Seemingly on purpose, they have found a way to be regulated by the least funded, the least
*  interested, the most distracted regulator in the game, which is the IRS.
*  And the only enforcement mechanism that might come down on them is if the IRS said, hey,
*  listen, you're supposed to operate primarily for the purpose of helping candidates.
*  You're not.
*  These groups, in fact, say that they just got audited by the IRS and the IRS told them
*  they were doing, quote unquote, a perfect job.
*  We can't check that.
*  The IRS won't tell us what they do with an individual taxpayer.
*  But these groups say, look, we've talked to the regulator.
*  We just got out of an examination with the toughest watchdog that exists in our little
*  world and we did fine.
*  OK, so the IRS is saying they're doing a perfect job.
*  But why does this blind spot exist?
*  Basically, the idea of regulating campaign finance is that if you're going to raise money
*  for politics, there's an assumption that you want to use it to influence politics.
*  And so all the policing and all the limitations and all the transparency is focused on giving
*  money to politicians who uses their money to help which politician to guard against
*  the quid pro quo.
*  The idea that you would raise money and then not spend it on politics, that you would give
*  it to yourself or you'd give it to your fundraisers, suck it out of politics.
*  There's really not a system built up to police that.
*  And it just wasn't anything someone imagined would be a problem when they set this system
*  up.
*  And so it becomes very easy to do it now because nobody really intended to guard against it.
*  So basically, when they imagine this class of nonprofit, they didn't conceive of the
*  possibility of using that money for something else entirely.
*  That's right.
*  And these groups are very deliberate about that.
*  So in the law, there's a tripwire that says if you spend more than a thousand dollars
*  helping any federal candidate, you have to report to the FEC, which has its problems,
*  but is a more aggressive and transparent agency.
*  If you spend over a certain amount in various states, you have to start reporting to those
*  state campaign finance watchdogs.
*  These groups were very careful not to do any of that, to just sort of keep their money
*  or spend it on things that had nothing to do with politics.
*  And for that reason, the only real rule they had to follow was this rule in tax law, which
*  is that they had to be operated primarily.
*  Those are the two important words, operated primarily for the purpose of influencing the
*  election of candidates or the selection of unelected people like Supreme Court justices.
*  But do these groups even pass that test?
*  Well, we talked to a lot of campaign finance experts who said no, that any reasonable expectation
*  would say that if you raised $89 million and only spent 1% on actual politics, that you're
*  not operated primarily for the purpose of influencing elections.
*  But what these groups say is that, look, you're just not thinking creatively enough.
*  You're just not drawing the circle of behavior wide enough.
*  They say, look, everything we do, even when we ask you for money, when we call you up
*  and say, hey, the police are under attack, give us money, that that in its own way is
*  political activism.
*  Yeah, we don't say the name of a candidate.
*  We don't tell you who to vote for.
*  But we're raising an issue with you that you might think of later on, and that would change
*  your vote.
*  So what they say is just if you define politics broadly enough and indirectly enough, that
*  really everything they do fits that definition.
*  So they're saying basically that the calls themselves are political, even though explicitly
*  in the calls, they're promising to spend money on actual candidates and they don't.
*  It's a weird sort of circular logic where like if you've given money for the service,
*  you've already gotten the service.
*  You know, like the calls are both the funding and the thing itself.
*  Self licking ice cream cone.
*  Self licking ice cream cone, exactly.
*  So that is an unbelievably huge loophole that just doesn't seem to protect us at all.
*  No, there's nothing in this system to protect the donors.
*  So what are the three guys you told us about have to say about all of this?
*  I mean, once you uncovered that connection between their companies and these 527 groups.
*  Basically that they were providing a service.
*  They were paid well and deservedly so for services they provided to these nonprofits
*  that were out there trying to change the world.
*  I want to read you the quote from John Connors, who wrote to say, yes, I am paid for what
*  I do.
*  Everybody is, he says.
*  But my real compensation is the satisfaction of Americans getting involved in the system.
*  How much money did he get again?
*  Groups that he owns got more than a million dollars.
*  So satisfaction of Americans plus a million dollars.
*  So right.
*  You know, I kept being surprised in this reporting.
*  I kept thinking we would find something more concrete, some real impact that these groups
*  had used with all their money and kept being surprised that I was wrong.
*  Right.
*  In theory here, the person who stands up for the donor is the donor themselves.
*  There's transparency theoretically in this system.
*  These groups have to file their expenses with the IRS so that a donor doesn't need somebody
*  to come in and stand up for them.
*  They can go search their filings and say, OK, is this a group I want to support or not?
*  But what we found shows kind of a folly of that expectation.
*  If you were a donor and you decided, hey, you know, I'm interested in knowing is the
*  American Police Officers Alliance a good use of my money?
*  First, you have to go to a Byzantine IRS site that doesn't really tell you anything about
*  what you're looking for.
*  And then if you manage to find one of their expenditure reports, you have to read 900
*  pages of expenditures, one dollar at a time.
*  It took us full time with powerful computers, weeks to try to get a real picture of how
*  these groups spent their money.
*  It's ludicrous to think that an individual donor could get anything like a reasonable
*  understanding of the way their money was going to be spent in a day, in a week and even a month.
*  So if the transparency is supposed to be sort of the cure in this system, that part is not working also.
*  The element of transparency is just absolutely absent from the rules.
*  Yeah, you can see all the trees, but there's no way in heck you're going to see the forest.
*  So stepping back here, you know, our country really has allowed for nearly unlimited money
*  in politics through these 527s and super PACs and all the rest of it.
*  And the fear among critics was that there would be too much money in politics, like
*  that unlimited money would corrupt our democratic system and disenfranchise voters.
*  And that's still a concern, of course.
*  But what you found is that we have a situation where the system, in a very direct way, is
*  simply dispensing with the politics altogether, is kind of double-crossing voters, you know,
*  taking their money and pocketing it.
*  Like, politics is just the cover.
*  Right. Yeah, the whole system is built around the idea of stopping a quid pro quo, or at
*  least illuminating if there was a chance for a quid pro quo.
*  It's not ready for the quid pro nothing.
*  You know, the quid pro nil, which is what's happening here.
*  You're giving money to somebody who just takes it out of the system entirely and doesn't
*  do the thing that they told you they were going to do with it.
*  There's not really a set up here.
*  What's ironic about this is that there's two sets of victims here.
*  There's the donors whose money is being siphoned out of the system.
*  But the other victim you could argue is Republican politicians.
*  Some of the folks who've pushed the hardest to deregulate money in politics.
*  A lot of these causes that these groups are raising money for are traditionally conservative
*  causes.
*  A lot of the folks they raise money from are traditionally conservative voters.
*  So these are people who might have given to Republican candidates and maybe thought they
*  were giving to Republican candidates, but instead had their money sort of sucked out
*  of the system.
*  So it's kind of an ironic outcome of this deregulation of politics that they've also
*  allowed people to use politics as a shield, use it as a lure, but then take all the money
*  out of the system and not give it to politicians at all.
*  One instantly stuck with me here in 2020, obviously a year when policing and standing
*  up for the police were a huge cause and a huge subject of political controversy in
*  America.
*  These groups raised $20 million, obviously drawing on the anger and the emotion that
*  came out of watching, you know, the Black Lives Matter and George Floyd protests, you
*  know, the people who felt like the police were being criticized too much.
*  They spent literally nothing.
*  Those two groups spent literally zero on politics that year.
*  So if you gave money to those groups and thought, okay, I've done my part to support police
*  in America, you didn't.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, it's unbelievably cynical, right?
*  Like brilliant, but also craven.
*  Absolutely.
*  Do you think that this loophole, now that you've exposed it in a big way, will be closed?
*  Or do you think that actually closing the loophole is in some ways antithetical to the
*  spirit of the law, which was to allow all kinds of money to be spent in a pretty unregulated
*  way, as you pointed out?
*  Like, does anyone actually want to close this loophole?
*  I hate to be cynical, but I don't think it's going to be closed.
*  And to me, that's a sign of how little interest or possibility there is for any sort of meaningful
*  campaign finance reform in this country, because if there's low-hanging fruit here, this is it.
*  This is something where people's money is being used in a way that's opposite of what
*  they think and where politicians themselves, people who'd be making the changes in the law,
*  are directly hurt by it.
*  And there's no sign that's going to change anytime soon.
*  No, not that I've seen.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me on.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, The Times reported that the drone attack on the Kremlin this month was
*  most likely orchestrated by one of Ukraine's special military units.
*  American spy agencies reached that conclusion, in part through intercepted communications from
*  both Ukrainian and Russian officials.
*  The May 3rd attack unsettled the Biden administration, which is worried that
*  strikes inside Russia could cause Moscow to retaliate beyond Ukraine.
*  And American intelligence agencies and Microsoft said that they detected a mysterious
*  computer code that they said had been installed by a Chinese government hacking group
*  in telecommunication systems in Guam.
*  The discovery raised alarms because Guam, with its specific ports and vast American airbase,
*  would be a centerpiece of any American military response to an invasion of Taiwan by China.
