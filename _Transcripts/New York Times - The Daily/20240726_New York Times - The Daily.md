# Is One Third of Venezuela’s Population About to Flee?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4qLKAbaXA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  For years, Venezuelans have been living through one of the most severe economic collapses
*  in modern history, one that has caused about a quarter of the country to flee.
*  This weekend, an election is offering many a real hope for change.
*  Today, my colleague Julie Turkowitz, on the woman who's inspiring that hope, and why,
*  after years under a repressive government, Venezuelans think this time might be different.
*  It's Friday, July 26th.
*  So Julie, we've spent a lot of time over the past couple of days on the show talking about
*  the thing that everybody's talking about, which is the American presidential election.
*  But there's another important election happening, and that is the one in Venezuela on Sunday.
*  The outcome could have some pretty serious repercussions, both for Latin America and
*  also for the United States.
*  You are covering it.
*  Talk to me about what's at stake here.
*  So Venezuela is a country of roughly 28 million people that has seen somewhere between seven
*  and eight million people leave in the last 10 years.
*  In other words, about a quarter of the country has left.
*  Many of our listeners have heard about this exodus because in recent years, many Venezuelans
*  are showing up in the United States.
*  Many of them are seeking asylum.
*  And what they are leaving behind is a pretty stark economic, humanitarian, and political
*  crisis.
*  And I think it's important to note that the only other places in the world in which we
*  see an exodus this large are places that are experiencing war.
*  If you're talking about Syria, Ukraine, the conflict in Afghanistan, Venezuela does not
*  have an armed conflict, but it has a very dysfunctional economy and it has a very repressive
*  government.
*  And so this is the backdrop to the election on Sunday.
*  And many Venezuelans hope that this election will reverse the immense suffering, restore
*  democracy and stop this exodus that has caused so much damage inside Venezuela.
*  Okay, before we get into this election and what it means to Venezuelans, I have to ask,
*  why would the president of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who, as you say, is this famously
*  authoritarian leader, agree to hold an election in the first place?
*  Well, Maduro has long loved holding elections because a vote makes him look legitimate.
*  The thing is that these elections have not really been free or fair in many years, but
*  he's holding elections this year under great international pressure.
*  The United States in recent years has placed punishing sanctions on the Venezuelan government.
*  This has strangled not only the government, but also the Venezuelan people.
*  And Maduro wants those sanctions to be lifted.
*  And one way to get sanctions lifted is to do what the U.S. wants, which is to hold a
*  free and fair election.
*  Now we know that this election on Sunday is not going to be free or fair, but it's happening.
*  Okay, so let's explore that.
*  How is it that voters in Venezuela, this country that at this point is barely a democracy
*  anymore, have actually come to believe that this time could be different?
*  So the way that I like to think about it is through the lens of one woman whose life kind
*  of embodies the challenges that Venezuelans across the country are facing right now.
*  And that person is a young woman named Leonela Colmenares.
*  She's 28 years old.
*  She lives in the state of Tachira on the western edge of Venezuela, the border with Colombia.
*  Leonela was a kid when Venezuela still had a pretty decent economy.
*  This was back during the era of Hugo Chavez.
*  Oil prices hit historic highs.
*  His socialist project was redistributing the wealth throughout Venezuela.
*  And Leonela remembers a comfortable childhood.
*  Food on the table, going on trips with her family to the beach.
*  And having these big Christmas celebrations with her extended family, which is a very
*  important Venezuelan tradition, sort of a staple of Venezuelan culture.
*  But as she gets older, life gets hard.
*  Around the time when Chavez dies in 2013, his handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro,
*  takes over and oil prices start plummeting.
*  And this causes the economy to really go into a freefall.
*  For Leonela, this means that her family now can't afford the medicine that her mother
*  needs for her chronic pains.
*  Leonela can no longer afford university tuition.
*  She's in and out of university.
*  She remembers this one day waiting in line all day long, splitting headache from hunger.
*  And at the end of the day, the only thing she's able to buy is a bag of corn flour.
*  And then in 2019, the U.S. imposes sanctions on Venezuela, which really strangles an already
*  crippled economy.
*  At the same time, Maduro, facing all of these economic problems, makes some changes.
*  And suddenly goods are coming into the country.
*  There are things on the shelves, but they're so expensive that everyday people like Leonela
*  cannot afford them.
*  And Leonela is seeing this mass exodus take shape around her.
*  Hundreds of thousands of people are leaving.
*  Maybe millions of people are leaving Venezuela to try and find opportunities abroad.
*  And so in 2022, Leonela becomes one of them.
*  She goes to Colombia.
*  But what she finds is that life far from her country is really hard and she can barely
*  make ends meet.
*  She's missing key moments in her family's life back home.
*  So she goes back to Venezuela a few months later.
*  Today she works three jobs.
*  She makes pastries.
*  She works as a university administrator.
*  And she's an informal taxi driver using her car to drive people around.
*  And yet she still can't afford her mother's medication.
*  But on top of that, she's finding that so many people around her have left.
*  The Christmas dinner table is full of empty seats.
*  And she eventually says that at least 10 people in her immediate family, her cousins, her
*  aunts, her uncles, have been part of this large exodus.
*  So she's back where she started.
*  And it sounds like the circumstances are actually even worse.
*  But you started this story, Julie, as a story of hope for Leonela.
*  So what changes?
*  What happens?
*  What changes are the politics in the country.
*  There is a new opposition leader on the rise and her name is Maria Corina Machal.
*  And suddenly Leonela and a broad swath of the country see a reason for hope and even
*  a path toward building a country that they would want to live in again.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So tell me about this opposition leader, Maria Machal.
*  So Maria Corina Machal is a longtime politician in Venezuela who has taken the country by
*  storm.
*  She is quite conservative.
*  She grew up in a well-to-do family.
*  She studied at a sort of elite boarding school.
*  She went to the US at one point to study.
*  She has cited Margaret Thatcher, the conservative icon, as one of her idols.
*  She's a very strong believer in the private sector, believes that the private sector
*  should be the motor of the economy.
*  And she has long argued for the privatization of the country's state oil company.
*  But the message that voters are really resonating with is not necessarily about her politics.
*  It's about what she's not.
*  She's not Mauro.
*  She's not Mauro's socialism.
*  And she has, I think, very smartly centered her campaign around the idea of reuniting
*  families.
*  Her rallies are incredibly emotional.
*  People crying in her arms.
*  Begging her, bring back my father, bring back my brother, bring back my sister.
*  There's a sort of almost deification, frankly, in the country.
*  I think that she has played this up.
*  Her team has played this up.
*  In a very religious country, her name is Maria, and she traverses the streets with people
*  yelling Maria, Maria.
*  Wow.
*  Help me, help me.
*  And people throwing rosaries at her.
*  She puts around her neck, if you watch her at campaigns, she wears not one, not two,
*  but ten rosaries around her neck.
*  And many people say she was brought to us by Jesus Christ.
*  Last year, there was this one moment, which I think is reflective of so many moments that
*  have happened since.
*  Amid the crowd, there's all of these people holding up their cell phones that are connected
*  to people in Colombia, family members in Peru, family members in the United States, so that
*  their brothers, mothers, sisters, children can see Maria, Corina Machado.
*  There was this one moment when Maria Corina Machado addresses this woman who is holding
*  up her phone and says, this is so your daughter can come back, and the daughter is on the
*  other line.
*  Wow.
*  And so what she is saying is, elect me, I will improve the economy, and I will create
*  a situation where the people that you love can come back and be with you in the country
*  that you love.
*  Of course, it's not really clear if these are promises that she can make good on.
*  But the fact that it almost doesn't matter whether or not she can is a reflection of
*  just how desperate people are for change.
*  And this message really resonates with Leonela.
*  And with thousands, if not millions, of young people just like her all across Venezuela.
*  And Leonela, who was previously part of a different opposition political party, starts
*  volunteering for Maria Corina's campaign.
*  So how has Maduro responded to Maria Machado's rise?
*  So Maduro is really trying to make it impossible for Maria Corina to become the president.
*  Her movement is clearly very popular.
*  It's shown in poll after poll.
*  And eventually, the Maduro government does this thing where it bans her from running.
*  And for a moment, the opposition is a little lost.
*  They've just lost their candidate.
*  And then the government allows her coalition to register somebody else.
*  And the coalition is able to put a surrogate on the ballot.
*  And this surrogate for Maria Corina is this little known diplomat named Edmundo Gonzalez.
*  So she's not even the candidate?
*  So technically, no, she's not the candidate.
*  But everyone in her movement knows that she's the real force behind his candidacy and that
*  she is really the person that they are voting for.
*  So Maduro's government won't let Maria run, but for some reason, he lets this other guy
*  run on her ticket.
*  Why does he do that?
*  What most observers and analysts say is that he didn't expect so much energy behind Maria
*  Corina Machado.
*  And then he didn't expect when he banned her, when his government banned her from running,
*  the opposition to be able to come around a new candidate.
*  The opposition in Venezuela is notoriously fractured.
*  And then the government did not expect Maria Corina to be able to transfer her popularity
*  to Edmundo Gonzalez.
*  They thought that they could control this election and that they could control this
*  movement.
*  And it has really become much bigger than Maduro and the people in his camp expected.
*  So he really underestimated them.
*  And now he has a situation on his hands.
*  He does.
*  He really does.
*  So in response, the government of Nicolás Maduro has really escalated tactics to try
*  and interfere with the opposition campaign.
*  The government has arrested dozens of supporters and fined people who simply offer services
*  to the campaign.
*  So we're talking of people who rent them a stage, rent them a truck.
*  People who sell them food have been fined.
*  The police have blocked roads to prevent Maria Corina from making it to her own rallies.
*  But so far, none of this has dampened support for the opposition.
*  And in fact, the opposite is happening.
*  It's making this campaign of Maria Corina and Edmundo Gonzalez even more popular.
*  So it really looks like things are on a collision course at this point.
*  We have the election on Sunday.
*  There's this hugely popular opposition now hurtling toward it.
*  And an authoritarian leader who's extremely unpopular and has been known to cheat to win.
*  I know from my years of foreign correspondence, you know, a bad loss can actually be pretty
*  hard to cover up.
*  So it's hard to see how this plays out peacefully.
*  Right.
*  There is an enormous amount of tension in Venezuela right now.
*  If the result shows that the opposition has won, will the government of Nicolás Maduro
*  hand over power?
*  He has essentially said, if I don't win, there is going to be a bloodbath and a fratricidal
*  war.
*  If the government of Nicolás Maduro says we won, is Maria Corina going to accept that?
*  And are people going to go to the streets and protest if they feel that their vote has
*  been stolen, if they feel that Nicolás Maduro has invented the numbers or somehow manipulated
*  the election in his favor?
*  And are you expecting to see violence, Julie?
*  We don't know.
*  There's a high likelihood that whatever result is announced on July 28th or more likely July
*  29th is going to be disputed by one of the sides.
*  The question is how big will the protest be and will they spin out of control?
*  What will be the response of the government?
*  Will there be violence?
*  A lot of people, including Leonela, have said that they're scared to protest.
*  I mean, nearly 300 people have died in the country in protests in the last 10 years.
*  Leonela specifically has said that she's not going to go to the streets.
*  She's not going to protest and said she's going to protest with her feet and she's going
*  to leave the country.
*  She plans to travel to the United States and she plans to do that despite all of the efforts
*  that Biden and other politicians have made to stop people from doing this.
*  And multiple polls show that as much as a third of the country is interested in leaving
*  if Maduro stays in power.
*  So the loss of an opposition leader who has promised to bring people back might result
*  in yet another mass exodus.
*  Exactly.
*  And I think that one thing that's really important to think about when you think about Leonela
*  is that seven to eight million people have left the country.
*  So many of those people are young people like Leonela.
*  She has stayed.
*  She has made a conscious decision.
*  She left for economic reasons, but then she came back.
*  If she leaves, it is sort of representative of this last slice of the country that could
*  fight to make change.
*  Kind of giving up and saying I have to leave.
*  I can't fight the fight anymore.
*  I have to leave for myself and my own protection.
*  Julie, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Thursday, California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered officials in his state to begin dismantling
*  thousands of homeless encampments, which have spread in recent years as the cost of housing
*  in California has skyrocketed.
*  It was the nation's most sweeping response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that gave
*  governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets.
*  His order could divide Democratic leaders in the state, some of whom have already begun
*  to clear encampments, while others have denounced the Supreme Court decision as an opening for
*  using inhumane measures to solve a complex crisis.
*  And what has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating.
*  Vice President Kamala Harris met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in her debut
*  on the world stage since her rapid ascension as the presumptive Democratic nominee for
*  president.
*  Harris did not stray from President Biden on policy, but she struck a stronger tone
*  on the plight of the Palestinians.
*  We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.
*  Declaring that, quote, far too many innocent civilians had died in Gaza.
*  A quick reminder to catch a new episode of The Interview right here tomorrow.
*  This week, Lulu Garcia Navarro talks to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg about the Democratic
*  Party in this moment.
*  Today's episode was produced by Carlos Prieto, Claire Tenesqueda, Olivia Natt, and Muj Zaydi.
*  It was edited by Liz O'Balin and Michael Benoit, contains original music by Dan Powell and
*  Marian Lozano, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderly.
*  Special thanks to Frances Robles and Anatoly Kurmanayev.
*  That's it for the daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  See you on Monday.
