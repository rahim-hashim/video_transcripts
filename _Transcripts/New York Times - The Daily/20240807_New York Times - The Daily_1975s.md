# Harris Chooses Walz
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpBszu7b6N8)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Before we get started, I want to tell you about another show made by the New York Times
*  that pairs perfectly with The Daily.
*  It's called The Headlines.
*  It's a show hosted by my colleague Tracy Mumford that quickly catches you up on the day's top
*  stories and features insights from the Times reporters who are covering them, all in about
*  10 minutes or less.
*  So if you like The Daily, and if you're listening, I have to assume you do, I hope that means
*  you're going to like The Headlines as well.
*  You can now find The Headlines wherever you get your podcasts.
*  So find it, subscribe to it, and thank you.
*  And now, here's today's Daily.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, the story of how a little-known Midwestern governor became Kamala Harris' choice for
*  a running mate.
*  My colleague Ernesto Landonio walks us through the career, politics, and sudden stardom of
*  Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota.
*  It's Wednesday, August 7th.
*  Ernesto, over the past few days, we watched Vice President Harris bring the final three
*  contenders for her running mate to her house in Washington, D.C. for a set of in-person
*  interviews, and then we watched as she seemed to narrow her pool of choices down to a final
*  two, the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, and the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz.
*  And now, of course, we know that she has made her choice.
*  What has she told us about her campaign strategy, the way she views this race, in ultimately
*  choosing Tim Walz?
*  Michael, I think what the choice tells us is that Kamala Harris was drawn to two qualities
*  that Governor Walz brings to the table.
*  And what's interesting is they may seem to be in tension.
*  For starters, here's the ultimate everyday man, somebody who grew up in a small town
*  in middle America, served in the National Guard, was a high school teacher, a football
*  coach, very plain spoken, goes to campaign events wearing t-shirts and baseball caps,
*  is a gun owner and very proud about it.
*  He sort of embodies the Midwest.
*  And she clearly thinks that that is going to bring the kind of moderate white working-class
*  voters that the campaign needs in swing states to come to them, to sort of make this feel
*  like a balanced ticket.
*  And something that will give her enough of the crucial votes to defeat Donald Trump
*  in the fall.
*  Right.
*  On the other hand, as governor, he passed a slew of pretty progressive legislation in
*  the past couple of years, everything from abortion rights to gun control.
*  So these things are likely to appeal to bread and butter Democrats.
*  But the question is, when voters have examined these two facets of Tim Walz, may it bring
*  them enough enthusiasm from the base and enough undecided voters that the campaign desperately
*  needs or at some point, do these two aspects of him start canceling each other out?
*  Right.
*  In short, you're saying Harris is betting on a dual appeal from Walz to two essential
*  constituencies.
*  But the risk is that the appeal to one of them is just much, much greater than to the
*  other.
*  Right.
*  You could definitely see a scenario where voters, once they've examined Tim Walz's
*  story and legacy, may conclude that both of these candidates are quite liberal.
*  OK, so tell us the story of Tim Walz, a story that I think a lot of us don't know because
*  we really don't know Walz all that well, and how he has come to embody these two qualities
*  and that tension that you just described.
*  Michael, the origin story of Tim Walz's political career is quite fascinating.
*  He and his wife were social studies teachers in a small city south of Minneapolis.
*  And in 2004, when George W. Bush was running for re-election, Walz took a group of his
*  students to a political rally in his hometown.
*  They wanted to just see the president make his case.
*  A strange scuffle happened when they were trying to get in.
*  Well, one of the kids had a John Kerry sticker on his wallet.
*  This is where the individual says, well, you're not going to be allowed to enter.
*  You've been deemed a threat.
*  Apparently, one of the students had a sticker for Bush's rival, John Kerry, on his wallet.
*  And security officials at the rally didn't want to let them in.
*  And I said, oh, it's OK.
*  They're with me.
*  Who are you?
*  I said, I'm Tim Walz.
*  I'm their teacher.
*  And they said, well, you too have been deemed a threat to the president.
*  And I said, well, that's not true.
*  And it kind of escalated.
*  And this really ticked off Tim Walz.
*  He was really upset.
*  There was a fight and a confrontation at the rally.
*  Wow.
*  At this point in time, I'm kind of nervous I'm going to get arrested.
*  So I'm like saying, well, you know, I'm teacher of the year in Mankato.
*  And they didn't care about that.
*  And it was kind of a sad epiphany moment, how it felt for people to be looked right through
*  by people.
*  These people didn't see me.
*  And this is happening all the time.
*  And ultimately, he sort of walks away from this moment feeling really sick of the Bush
*  administration, the politics of the day.
*  And he turns around and volunteers for the Kerry campaign.
*  And then the more interested he becomes in politics in this era, he starts looking around
*  his congressional district.
*  And there's a Republican who's held this seat for many, many years.
*  This was a largely rural district in southern Minnesota.
*  And there's no reason to believe that a newcomer to politics, somebody without a donor base,
*  could make a run for this seat and win.
*  But Walz signs up for this weekend boot camp where expert campaigners train newcomers who
*  want to run for office.
*  And he gets really enthused by the idea that he can pull it off.
*  So he starts raising money with the support of an army of students who become so thrilled
*  and energized by the prospect that their nerdy and kind geography teacher is making this
*  uphill bid for a congressional race.
*  So his campaign staff is basically his former students.
*  That's right.
*  And he proves to be a formidable candidate.
*  He draws a lot of attention to his experience in the classroom and as a coach.
*  When I coached football, these stands held about 3000 people.
*  That's a lot.
*  It's also the number of American soldiers who have died fighting in Iraq.
*  He's a very strong advocate for pulling out of the war in Iraq.
*  Serving right now are kids that I taught, coached, and trained to be soldiers.
*  They deserve a plan for Iraq to govern itself so they can come home.
*  One thing that happens in the campaign that is really surprising to people is he comes
*  out as being in favor of same-sex marriage.
*  Now it's useful to remember that this is 2006 when the vast majority of Democrats, Democrats
*  running for most elected office, were not ready to come out in favor of same-sex marriage.
*  And here's a guy who's new to politics, who's trying to unseat a Republican who's held onto
*  his seat for more than 12 years, taking what appeared to be a reckless position on something.
*  And when he was asked about it at the time, Tim Walz told his supporter, you know, this
*  just happens to be what I believe in and I'd rather lose a race that I've ran being true
*  and consistent to my values than try to run as somebody I'm not.
*  Hmm.
*  And of course, he wins.
*  Yes, to everybody's surprise, he pulled it off.
*  So from the get-go, he shows a kind of maverick, politics-b-damned quality, taking stands that
*  he knows may be unpopular among the voters he's trying to win over, but he's got some
*  innate political gifts that are all making it work.
*  Yeah, I think that first campaign showed us that Tim Walz had real political chops.
*  He was a very effective campaigner and people really liked him.
*  When he was knocking on doors, when he was introducing himself to voters, they saw him
*  as somebody who was very genuine and who was admirable.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  So once he gets elected in this conservative-leaning district in Minnesota, what does he actually
*  do in Congress?
*  In Congress, he develops a reputation for being somebody who can work across the aisle.
*  And this is a period where Democrats and Republicans were deeply polarized over the Iraq War.
*  He spends a lot of his time lobbying to expand benefits for veterans so it's easier for them
*  to go to college after their service, and also becomes a leading voice in the quest
*  to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the policy that prohibited openly gay servicemen from
*  serving in uniform.
*  And he remained really popular.
*  He easily won re-election five times.
*  The last time he runs for his seat happens to be 2016, when President Trump wins his
*  district by about 15 points.
*  And still, you know, voters kept Tim Walz in office.
*  I think it's important to note what you just said.
*  is distinguishing himself as a Democrat who can take some pretty progressive positions,
*  as he did in that first campaign on gay rights, as he did with Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and
*  keep winning in very Trump-friendly districts of his state.
*  That's right.
*  And as he's serving his sixth term in office, he sets his sights on the governor's mansion
*  and decides to run for office in 2018.
*  He wins that race easily.
*  And early on during his time as governor, the eyes of the world are on Minnesota after
*  a police officer kills George Floyd.
*  And what we see is massive looting and protests in Minneapolis.
*  Right.
*  And remind us how Governor Walz handles that violence, those protests.
*  Yeah, I think that's a crucial chapter in Tim Walz's political career and one that will
*  come under scrutiny in the days ahead.
*  After George Floyd was killed on a Monday,
*  protests took root in Minneapolis.
*  And they got progressively larger and more violent.
*  There comes a point where the mayor and the police chief in Minneapolis plead for help.
*  They ask the governor to send in the National Guard.
*  And crucially, that request was not immediately heeded.
*  This is the third precinct here.
*  There are fires burning to the left of it.
*  And at the height of the crises, a police precinct building was abandoned.
*  There's someone climbing up the wall right now, kicking the window in, trying to climb
*  up the wall.
*  Because city officials grew concerned that protesters were about to overrun it and may
*  attack the cops inside their own turf.
*  And the building is set on fire.
*  Right, a very memorable image.
*  I can recall it happening in real time.
*  Yeah, and in the days that followed, I think there were a lot of questions of why the governor
*  didn't send in troops earlier and whether a more muscular, decisive response could have
*  averted some of the destruction that spread through the city.
*  And how does Walls end up explaining his decision not to send in the National Guard more quickly?
*  The governor and his administration have said that they were really, really dealing with
*  an unprecedented challenge.
*  And I think there was a concern that sending in troops into this really, really tense situation
*  could have done more to escalate rather than pacify things on the street.
*  But in the weeks and months that followed, there were a lot of questions about Governor
*  Walls' leadership.
*  And there were critics who said during what may have been the most challenging week of
*  his life, we saw a governor who was indecisive and who waited too long to send in resources
*  that ultimately allowed the city to get to a semblance of order.
*  Right.
*  And it looks like this is a moment that will almost assuredly be used against him by Donald
*  Trump and J.D. Vance, the Republican ticket, which has made law and order so central to
*  their message in this campaign.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And here in Minnesota, that was certainly a liability for him when he ran for reelection
*  in 2022.
*  But voters kept him in office and he won that race handedly.
*  And not only did he win, but Democrats managed to flip the Senate and have full control of
*  the legislature on his watch.
*  And that sets in motion one of the most productive legislative sessions in Minnesota history,
*  where Tim Walls and his allies in the House and the Senate managed to pass a trove of
*  really progressive legislation, oftentimes on a party vote.
*  Tell us about some of that legislation.
*  Well, Minnesota becomes the first state in the wake of the Supreme Court ending the constitutional
*  right to abortion to actually codify this right under state statute.
*  And they did a lot more stuff.
*  They had a huge budget surplus and they used that, for instance, to fund meals for all
*  school children.
*  They managed to pass a couple of gun control laws that were very contentious.
*  They gave the right to undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses.
*  They legalized recreational marijuana.
*  And finally, the governor takes a pretty bold stance on this issue of gender affirming care
*  for transgender kids and teenagers and says that Minnesota will be a safe haven for people
*  who want that health care.
*  So Ernesto, how should we think about that blitz of legislation and the largely progressive
*  tone of it, given the way that Walls had campaigned and succeeded up to that moment as somebody
*  with such broad appeal across the political spectrum?
*  When the governor was asked whether this had been too much too quickly in terms of progressive
*  legislation, his answer was that these were broadly popular policies, that these were
*  issues Democrats had campaigned on.
*  And here, Democrats had a window of opportunity where they were in control of the governor's
*  mansion, in control of the House, the Senate, and that when you have political capital,
*  you spend it.
*  But when you start listening to Republicans in Minnesota, they say, here's a guy who campaigned
*  on this mantra of one Minnesota.
*  That was his campaign slogan and who sort of came into office with his promise that
*  he would govern in a bipartisan way, reach across the aisle.
*  But when they had all the votes they needed to pass their policies, Republicans felt
*  that Walls was not bothering to bring them into the fold and to pass legislation that
*  was going to be palatable to conservatives in the state.
*  So I think people who once regarded him as a moderate now start seeing him as somebody
*  who, when he had the power, acted in ways that were really progressive and liberal.
*  At the height of his power, Governor Walls emerges as somebody who, when given a shot
*  at getting done what he really wants to get done with a Democratic legislature, is a pretty
*  progressive leader, even at the risk of being somewhat at odds with his earlier image as
*  more moderate, because in his mind, enough people in the state are behind these policies.
*  Yeah, and I think he assumed that he had banged enough goodwill and that people across the
*  state liked him enough to tolerate policies they may have disagreed with.
*  And I think it's safe to say, among the people who cover him here regularly, there was never
*  any real hint that Tim Walls was eyeing a run for higher office.
*  He's not somebody who's written the kind of political memoir that oftentimes serves as
*  a case of what you would bring to a national ticket or to the White House.
*  And he seems pretty happy with the state job.
*  So it was a huge surprise when Tim Walls starts going viral through a string of cable news
*  appearances right after President Biden drops out of the race and the Democrats are scrambling
*  to put Harris at the top of the ticket.
*  And what becomes clear is that Walls is very forcefully auditioning for the role of vice
*  president and vice president Harris starts taking him very seriously.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Ernesto, tell us about this cable news audition that Governor Walls undertakes over
*  the past few weeks and how ultimately it seemed to help him land this job of being Harris's
*  running mate.
*  I think Walls does something really interesting, and that is that he says that Democrats shouldn't
*  be talking about Trump and Vans as existential threats.
*  He kind of makes the case that Democrats have been in the state of fear and paralysis for
*  too long and that it's not serving them well.
*  So the word he latches on to is weird.
*  Well it's true.
*  These guys are just weird.
*  And they're running for He-Man Women Haters Club or something.
*  That's what they go at.
*  That's not what people are interested in.
*  And I think one other thing we see in Walls is somebody who is putting himself out there
*  as a foil to J.D. Vance.
*  That angst that J.D. Vance talks about in Hillbilly Elegy, none of my Hillbilly cousins
*  went to Yale and none of them went on to be adventure capitalists or whatever.
*  And I think the case he's making is that Tim Walls is a more authentic embodiment of small
*  town values.
*  What I know is that people like J.D. Vance know nothing about small town America.
*  My town had 400 people in it, 24 kids in my graduating class, 12 were cousins, and he
*  gets it all wrong.
*  It's not about hate.
*  And behind the scenes, people from Tim Walls' days on Capitol Hill start calling everybody
*  they know in the Harris campaign and the Harris orbit and saying, you know, here's a guy who
*  has executive experience as governor, but also somebody who has a really impressive
*  record from his time on Capitol Hill and somebody who could be an asset in helping a Harris
*  administration pass tough legislation.
*  So you should take a hard look at this guy.
*  Which is, of course, exactly what Harris ends up doing.
*  And I want to talk for a moment about how Harris announces Walls as her running mate
*  on Tuesday morning.
*  She did it in an Instagram message and it felt like the way she did it very much embraced
*  this idea that you raised earlier, Ernesto, that Walls contains these two appeals, one
*  to the Democratic base, one to the white working class.
*  Harris specifically cites the work that Walls did with Republicans on infrastructure and
*  then cites his work on gun control.
*  She mentions that he was a football coach and the founder of the high school Gay Straight
*  Alliance.
*  She's straddling these two versions of Walls.
*  But I want to linger on the idea for a moment of Walls' vulnerabilities, because once he
*  becomes Harris' running mate, Harris and Walls are going to lose a fair amount of control
*  over how they present him to the country because he's going to become the subject of very fierce
*  attacks from the Republicans in this race.
*  So talk about that for just a moment.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's important to keep in mind that Governor Walls has never endured the
*  scrutiny of a presidential race.
*  So the questions he's going to be asked and the way his record is going to be looked at
*  is going to be different and sharper.
*  You know, I think the Harris campaign is billing him as first and foremost a fighter for the
*  middle class.
*  And I think that certainly will have some appeal.
*  But I think in coming days, there's going to be a lot of attention drawn to parts of
*  his record that may be unpopular with many voters.
*  For instance, giving undocumented immigrants driver's licenses, which Governor Walls championed,
*  is likely to provide fodder for an attack ad.
*  The very dramatic footage of Minneapolis burning in 2020 is also something that I think people
*  will be drawn to.
*  And there's going to be interest in re-examining what the governor did and what he could have
*  done differently to avert the chaos.
*  And on Tuesday, we saw that the Trump campaign wasted no time in trying to define Tim Walls
*  as soft on crime, permissive on immigration policy.
*  And they also made clear they wanted to re-litigate the era of George Floyd's killing.
*  And specifically, they want to try to tie him to the effort at the time to defund the
*  police, which is a movement that Walls personally never endorsed.
*  So the Republican attack here will be pretty simple.
*  Walls is liberal.
*  Harris is liberal.
*  So in their efforts to speak to especially white working class and rural voters in swing
*  states, the Trump campaign is going to say, this is not the ticket for that group of voters.
*  This is the ticket of burning police precincts and gun control.
*  And of course, that may not be fair, but that's very likely going to be the message over the
*  next couple of months.
*  Right.
*  I think there's going to be effort to portray him as a radical liberal who has used his
*  small town roots to put on this sort of veneer of being a moderate and a really sort of understanding
*  and being part of the segments of the electorate that I think are critical in this election.
*  I want to speak for just a moment about the person Harris did not pick when she chose Walls,
*  because many Democrats had felt that Walls was a potentially too liberal seeming running
*  made for a candidate, Kamala Harris, who herself comes from a blue state and is caricatured
*  by the Republicans as liberal herself.
*  And the person she didn't choose was Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who was seen
*  as having a huge appeal in that particular key swing state, but also presented risks
*  of his own of alienating parts of the Democratic base with his well-documented support for
*  Israel and his criticism of campus protesters.
*  How should we think about the fact that ultimately Harris chose Walls over Shapiro?
*  Yeah, I think in the final stretch of this campaign to be the vice presidential pick,
*  we started seeing a lot of acrimony in pockets of the Democratic face, drawing attention
*  to the fact that Governor Shapiro could be divisive on Gaza, which has really sort of
*  split the party in recent months.
*  So I think at the end of the day, they made a calculation that Tim Walz would be more
*  of a unifying figure and would be somebody who would sort of inspire and energize enough
*  pockets of the electorate that they need, particularly in the Midwest, to make him the
*  stronger and more exciting pick and somebody who wouldn't force them to go back to defending
*  and to re-litigating the Biden administration's record on Israel and on the war in Gaza.
*  Right. And then on Tuesday night, we got our first glimpse of Harris and Walz together
*  on stage for the first time at a campaign rally.
*  I'm curious what struck you about their debut together.
*  Good evening, Philadelphia.
*  I think everybody was watching the opening scene of this rally to see what the chemistry
*  between these two people is going to be like.
*  And they both seemed giddy.
*  They were literally at times bouncing with enthusiasm.
*  Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build
*  this brighter future.
*  So, Pennsylvania, I'm here today because I found such a leader.
*  They soon got down to business, and that business was how to define Tim Walz for voters
*  who don't know him well.
*  To those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor.
*  And right off the bat, we saw that Kamala Harris really highlighted a lot of pieces of
*  his pre-political career.
*  To his former high school football players, he was coach.
*  She repeatedly called him Coach Walz, Mr. Walz, evoking his time in the classroom, and
*  even used his military title from his days in the army.
*  To his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz.
*  And then when it came time for Tim Walz to introduce himself on this massive stage.
*  Welcome the next vice president of the United States, Tim Walz.
*  He drew a lot of attention to his small town roots.
*  I was born in West Point, Nebraska.
*  I lived in Butte, a small town of 400.
*  He said something that he said repeatedly recently in campaign appearances, which is
*  In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make.
*  Even if we wouldn't make the same choice for ourselves, there's a golden rule.
*  Mind your own damn business.
*  The golden rule of small towns is you mind your own damn business, which is something
*  he said in the context of his argument that Republicans have been limiting rather than
*  expanding people's rights.
*  But he also drew attention to the fact that he's a gun owner.
*  By the way, as you heard, I was in the best shots in Congress.
*  But in Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment, but we also believe in common sense
*  gun violence laws.
*  And then when it came time to draw a sharp contrast with their opponents, Tim Walz said
*  these guys are phonies.
*  Donald Trump's not fighting for you or your family.
*  He never he never said at that kitchen table like the one I grew up at, wondering how we
*  were going to pay the bills.
*  He set his country club up in Mar-a-Lago wondering how he can cut taxes for his rich friends.
*  He said it's actually people like me and Kamala Harris who come from humble origins and
*  showed what is possible in America when you hail from a working class background and you
*  seize opportunities that were available to you.
*  Thank you, Philadelphia.
*  Thank you, Vice President.
*  God bless America.
*  So when it comes to this question of Walz's dual identities and dual appeals, what did
*  we learn on day one of this new Democratic ticket, do you think?
*  I think the campaign is trying to convey that these two facets of Tim Walz's life are not
*  mutually exclusive, that they don't need to be intentioned.
*  They don't cancel each other out.
*  They're both part of Tim Walz's story.
*  And I think that's how they're going to present him from now until Election Day.
*  Ernesto, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  It's my pleasure, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  On Tuesday, Hamas said that Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds behind the deadly October
*  7th attacks on Israel, had consolidated his power over the entire organization.
*  Until now, Sinwar had held the title of Hamas's leader in Gaza.
*  But with the assassination of Hamas's top political leader by Israel last week, Hamas
*  said that Sinwar would take on that title as well.
*  Sinwar remains a major target of Israel and is believed to have been hiding in tunnels
*  underneath Gaza since October 7th.
*  And the U.S.
*  Department of Justice has charged a Pakistani man with ties to Iran with trying to hire
*  a hitman to assassinate political figures in the United States.
*  The man recently traveled to the U.S.
*  and was arrested in New York last month.
*  American authorities believe that his potential targets likely included former President
*  Trump.
