# China, Russia and the Risk of a New Cold War
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rqJX6pvmXE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  On Monday, President Xi Jinping of China began his first official visit to Russia since Vladimir
*  Putin invaded Ukraine.
*  Today, my colleague Edward Wong explains what President Xi is really up to, and why that's
*  making people wonder whether a new Cold War is underway.
*  It's Tuesday, March 21st.
*  So Ed, set the scene for us on Monday.
*  President Xi Jinping arrives in Russia.
*  What does it look like?
*  Well, this is touted as a big state visit for President Xi.
*  He touched down in Moscow, and then he was greeted with lots of fanfare.
*  He walked off the plane onto a red carpet.
*  There was a military band there to welcome him.
*  Then he stepped into a convoy to be taken to a lunch with President Putin.
*  And then the two were supposed to hold informal talks throughout the afternoon at the Kremlin
*  on Monday.
*  And what will Putin and Xi be discussing?
*  Why exactly is Xi there?
*  Well, Xi and Putin have a very close personal affinity for each other.
*  Before this trip, they had already met 39 times since Xi became China's leader in 2012.
*  Wow, 39 times.
*  Yeah, it's by far more than any other nation-to-nation leadership meeting that Xi has had.
*  He's never met with any other leader nearly as much as he has with Putin.
*  The two have exchanged pleasantries and even gifts on each other's birthdays, for example.
*  Xi and Putin were both in Tajikistan in 2019 for Xi's 66th birthday.
*  Putin gave him ice cream, and then they toasted with champagne.
*  And apparently, according to state media reports, Xi then gave Putin a gift of Chinese black
*  tea.
*  Huh, okay.
*  But this trip is obviously about much more than two old friends just catching up, right?
*  Well, the Chinese government is framing Xi's visit as a mission of peace.
*  Chinese officials say that Xi's intended goal is to bring about a ceasefire or some form
*  of peace talks so that they can quiet hostilities between Russia and Ukraine.
*  The US officials and European officials are skeptical that that's what China is really after.
*  So, Ed, what is China really after?
*  China wants to shore up its relationship with Russia.
*  And in trying to strengthen ties with Russia, Xi is trying to add to this broader campaign
*  that he's carrying out to push back against what they see as aggressive behavior by the
*  United States.
*  Xi has been very explicit in his concerns over this.
*  Just this month in a political meeting in Beijing, he made this very big statement that
*  Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-around containment, encirclement,
*  and suppression of China.
*  And that's a big deal that he used the phrase all-around containment to describe what the
*  US is doing.
*  It obviously hearkens back to the Cold War, to the US policy of containment of the Soviet
*  Union.
*  And it's very rare that Xi or other Chinese officials very explicitly lay out their concerns
*  about the US and their concerns about US policy in this manner.
*  Interesting.
*  So Xi is pointing directly to the US and using language from the Cold War.
*  Speaking about this containment, what does that look like from the perspective of the
*  Chinese?
*  Like, if I'm stepping into Xi's shoes, what am I seeing?
*  Well, Sabrina, from Beijing's perspective, they're seeing a whole host of policies that
*  they think are designed to suppress China's economic growth and contain its military ambitions.
*  They see this as having really started in earnest during the Trump administration, but
*  then ramping up in the Biden administration, even just in the last several months.
*  So for example, last October, the Biden administration announced these sweeping policies on banning
*  semiconductor exports to China.
*  They said US companies and some companies within partner nations could not send advanced
*  semiconductor technology to China or sell semiconductor manufacturing tools that would
*  help China advance its industry.
*  So Chinese officials see this as an action to really try and hobble China's economic
*  and technological advancement, since so much of what we use in our modern world, whether
*  it's household appliances or in military advancement, rely on semiconductor technology and advancing
*  that technology.
*  Right.
*  That was a really important moment last fall.
*  And then, of course, as we talked about on the show on Monday, the Biden administration
*  took aim at another part of China's economy when just last week it emerged that the administration
*  might ban TikTok because TikTok is owned by a Chinese company.
*  Right.
*  And that's another huge deal in the eyes of Chinese officials.
*  Obviously, we all know how successful TikTok is as a company.
*  And the Biden administration is saying that the Chinese company that owns TikTok has to
*  sell shares in it because it sees TikTok as a potential national security threat.
*  China obviously sees that as another effort by the U.S. to try and keep China down economically
*  and that the U.S. will always suspect China or Chinese companies of harboring ill intentions
*  toward the U.S.
*  And of course, beyond just its economic ambitions, you also said Xi thinks the U.S. is trying
*  to suppress China's military ambitions, too.
*  Right.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Well, Beijing's looking around at all these actions that the Biden administration has
*  been taking recently in the Asia-Pacific region.
*  And from the Chinese officials' perspectives, they're growing increasingly alarmed about
*  this.
*  Well, Mr. Prime Minister, it's great to see you again.
*  So for example, in January, Prime Minister Kishida from Japan came to the U.S. and met
*  with Biden in the White House.
*  Today I'm looking forward to how we can continue advancing our shared goals and values.
*  At that meeting, President Biden announced that the U.S. would help Japan bolster its
*  military and change its military posture in the region.
*  And that includes everything from bolstering Japan's missile capabilities to overhauling
*  the U.S. Marine presence in the Japanese islands to make them more deployable in the event
*  of a conflict in the Asia-Pacific.
*  This was a big deal because since World War II, Japan has maintained a pacifist standing
*  and tried to downplay any military advances that it's making.
*  The U.S. is saying that that's about to change.
*  And was China directly referenced in this announcement?
*  The two leaders didn't mention China, but when you talk to U.S. officials in Washington,
*  they say the main impetus is to allow the U.S. and its allies in the region to be able
*  to counter China and its military if Beijing were to take action against Taiwan or some
*  other territory in the Asia-Pacific region.
*  Now as you might remember, Taiwan is the biggest flashpoint between the U.S. and China.
*  Taiwan is a self-governing democratic island that's off the southeast coast of China.
*  The U.S. says it's a partner of Taiwan and it wants to be able to help Taiwan in some
*  way if China were ever to try and take Taiwan militarily.
*  Okay, so the change with Japan is one example.
*  What else has the U.S. been doing?
*  Good morning, everyone.
*  Well this winter, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made a trip to Manila, the capital
*  of the Philippines.
*  America's commitment to the defense of the Philippines is ironclad.
*  And while there, he and the Philippine leaders announced that the U.S. military would have
*  greater access to Philippine military bases across the entire island chain.
*  That includes a base in the northern part of the Philippines, close to Taiwan.
*  And this was significant because it puts U.S. troops in a better position to defend Taiwan
*  if there were some conflict over the island.
*  And this potentially could mean that the U.S. military would have its biggest presence
*  in the Philippines of the last 30 years.
*  And these efforts are especially important as the People's Republic of China continues
*  to advance its illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea.
*  So the U.S. is steadily increasing its military presence throughout the Pacific.
*  That's right, Sabrina.
*  And actually, an announcement by President Biden this month was the biggest military
*  in that trend.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, accompanied by the Prime Minister
*  of Australia and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
*  Biden and the Prime Ministers of Australia and the U.K. stood together at a naval base
*  in San Diego and announced that the U.S. would start sharing nuclear submarine technology
*  with Australia, with the intent that Australia would eventually build its own for use across
*  the Asia Pacific.
*  It's my honor to welcome both the United States as we take the next critical step in advancing
*  the Australia-U.S.-U.K. partnership AUKUS.
*  It's the first time in 65 years that the U.S. is sharing this type of technology with another
*  country.
*  It's only done it once before with the U.K.
*  The AUKUS agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment
*  in Australia's defense capability in all of our history.
*  And it hopes that Australia and its new submarine fleet will be able to aid the U.S. and other
*  partners and allies in case there is a conflict with China in the region.
*  And it strikes me that what the U.S. is doing here is putting increased military pressure
*  on China without actually having to commit any of its own forces.
*  Like it's all by proxy.
*  That's right.
*  And the Biden administration is very proud of this.
*  They came into office saying that they were going to rebuild their partnerships and alliances
*  with other countries after the Trump era.
*  And in a way, that's exactly what they've done.
*  In these countries, places like Japan or the Philippines are completely on board with this
*  because they see China as a potential threatening military actor too.
*  And they want to be able to have deterrence against China.
*  And they see a partnership with the U.S. as one of the best ways of going about doing
*  that.
*  Now, if you're looking at this from Xi's perspective, you're seeing what he calls all-around containment
*  of China.
*  He sees this encirclement of China by the U.S. and he feels he needs to get out there
*  in the world in order to shore up China's influence around the globe, in order to strengthen
*  its most powerful partners, and in order to build up ties with countries in some of the
*  most important parts of the world.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Ed, walk us through the steps Xi has taken over the past few weeks to build up ties and
*  shore up its influence around the world at this moment when the U.S. has taken all these
*  actions to counter China.
*  Well, one of the most striking diplomatic actions that China took just happened 10 days
*  ago.
*  This was when China hosted leaders from Iran and from Saudi Arabia in Beijing to sign an
*  important diplomatic agreement to reopen relations with each other.
*  And that was a big deal because Iran and Saudi Arabia are long-time rivals.
*  There has been increasing hostilities between these two countries, and officials around
*  the world even fear that they could get involved in a nuclear arms race sometime soon.
*  And now here is China, which has growing ties to both of these countries, stepping in and
*  trying to make some sort of initial steps toward peace take place between the two nations.
*  Ed, you don't normally think of China as a mediator in the Middle East, right?
*  You think of the U.S.
*  So why was China doing this?
*  That's right.
*  China has not played a very proactive role in diplomacy in the region.
*  But in recent years, it's had growing interests across the Middle East, and especially with
*  countries in the Gulf area.
*  So it imports around 40% of its oil from the region.
*  And both Iran and Saudi Arabia are the two biggest sellers of oil to China.
*  So China needs to make sure that there's stability in the area.
*  So here what we're seeing is China willing to step in and play mediator in order to ensure
*  that stability.
*  It's unclear whether China will be able to do that.
*  But it's trying to make itself into a more important player.
*  In some ways, as you point out, stepping into the type of role that the U.S. has played
*  in the region.
*  Now in this case, China was a much more logical mediator than the U.S.
*  The U.S. would not be able to accomplish what China had just done because the U.S. doesn't
*  have formal diplomatic relations with Iran.
*  Right.
*  China, on the other hand, has diplomatic relations with both countries.
*  In fact, its ties with both of them are growing stronger by the month.
*  So China has powers that the U.S. doesn't have.
*  Namely, it has relations with Iran and it can in some ways look like the adult in the
*  room in the Middle East.
*  Right.
*  And there's another important goal that China has in the region.
*  And that is expanding its military footprint.
*  And we know that they've been trying to get access to parts of the Gulf region in order
*  to establish a military base.
*  U.S. officials have pushed back against that and they've been trying to get countries in
*  the region to promise that they will not give China military access.
*  And has China gotten military access?
*  So far, China has not been able to build a base in the region, but U.S.
*  officials are watching closely for whether they'll try to do that.
*  So the Biden administration carefully watching it.
*  The Biden administration presumably also carefully watching this week's visit by Xi to Moscow.
*  How exactly does this visit fit into the broader framework you're describing of China pushing
*  back and shoring up itself against the U.S.?
*  Well, as you know, China and Russia have had longstanding ties.
*  There's a whole range of interests that they share.
*  For example, China imports a lot of Russian oil, as it does from the Middle East.
*  It also has many close security arrangements with Russia.
*  The two militaries do join exercises together.
*  They've done that several times this year.
*  But perhaps the biggest significance of this visit is that it's meant to reinforce this
*  worldview that officials and leaders in both Beijing and Moscow have and that Xi and Putin
*  have both highlighted.
*  And that is that they see the U.S. as their biggest shared rival or adversary on the world
*  stage and that they believe that together they can present a united front to push back
*  against U.S. dominance in the world.
*  Right.
*  They share this one very important thing, a frustration with American power and with
*  how America wields that power.
*  That's right.
*  And the leaders in both countries are very explicit about that.
*  But we also don't want to overstate how closely their general worldviews are aligned.
*  For example, the fact that Putin operates in many ways as a chaos agent in different
*  parts of the world and obviously most recently in this invasion of Ukraine, that's something
*  that China is not entirely happy about.
*  China sees the international order and the global economy as important for its ride in
*  the world, as important for powering its economic engine.
*  And the more that Putin does to disrupt all of that, the worse it is for China.
*  China now has to deal with a whole range of sanctions on Russia.
*  It has to rework its trade ties.
*  And it also has to deal with the fluctuations in global energy prices and in other parts
*  of the world economy because of what Putin is doing.
*  Right.
*  Not something that Xi really wants to be dealing with.
*  So there is some incentive then for China to play the role of peacemaker in Ukraine,
*  which is how China is describing this trip.
*  That's right, Sabrina.
*  There is some incentive.
*  But so far, what they've proposed or the statements they've made don't give US and some European
*  officials a lot of confidence.
*  We don't see China making the commitments or asking Putin to withdraw his troops, which
*  US officials say would lead to an authentic and durable peace in Ukraine.
*  So it's a peacemaking mission in words only?
*  Well, when I talk with US officials and some analysts here in Washington, they say that
*  what might be happening is that Xi and his colleagues in Beijing are presenting a cover
*  story for their real intentions on this visit to Russia.
*  So it sounds good to the world that they're on a peace mission to try and end the Ukraine
*  war.
*  But what these two leaders are really doing in Moscow is to shore up relations between
*  their two countries to talk about how the two nations can cooperate on a whole range
*  of issues because each sees the other as indispensable in being able to push back against
*  the US on all kinds of fronts, whether that's in trade, in technology and in military terms,
*  too.
*  So, Ed, you're describing a very complex set of alliances that Xi is trying to weave
*  in light of what he sees as mounting pressure on him by the US.
*  So to get back to the beginning of our conversation when you quoted Xi's statement, which used
*  language from the Cold War era, are we seeing the beginnings of a new kind of Cold War with
*  the US and its allies on one side and China and its allies on the other?
*  Well, Sabrina, people keep asking that question, but I think it's much more complicated than
*  that.
*  All these countries, whether it's the US or its European allies or its allies in Asia,
*  they all have very close trade ties to China.
*  China is, in many cases, the biggest trading partner for some of these countries.
*  So I think that the animosities that we're seeing building up are not as clear cut as
*  they were during the Cold War and the relationships are much more complex than what took place
*  between the Western blocs and the Eastern blocs during the height of the Cold War.
*  Right.
*  The world is just much more complicated than it was back then in that these countries all
*  had their economies deeply intertwined.
*  That's right, Sabrina.
*  But it's still hard not to draw some parallels between what's going on now and the Cold War
*  that took place between the US and the Soviet Union.
*  And you know, there's a funny coincidence taking place in Moscow during this visit by
*  Xi.
*  When Xi and Putin sit down for their formal state dinner, they'll be doing so in the room
*  where Reagan and Gorbachev met many years ago.
*  And at that point, Reagan and Gorbachev toasted each other and to growing relations between
*  their two countries.
*  Huh.
*  So it's come full circle, right?
*  Histories come back around.
*  Only now, of course, it's Xi and Putin who are toasting each other.
*  That's right.
*  Those two leaders will be sitting in that room and raising their glasses to each other.
*  And they'll be toasting to a shared partnership that's aimed in large part and countering
*  American power.
*  Ed, thank you.
*  Thanks a lot, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  In France on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron's government narrowly survived a no-confidence
*  vote in parliament, clearing the way for a highly controversial bill that would raise
*  the retirement age from 62 to 64 to become law.
*  Macron had said the law was essential for the future of France's economy, but the change
*  struck at a cherished French value and widespread fury at the law prompted Macron's opponents
*  to take aim at his government with a no-confidence vote.
*  The failure by just nine votes sparked more protests across France.
*  And President Biden has issued the first veto of his presidency, rejecting a Republican
*  bill that would prevent the federal government from making investment decisions based on
*  factors like a company's policy on diversity and carbon emissions.
*  The bill was a direct attack on an increasingly popular investment philosophy known as ESG.
*  Advocates say it's profitable for businesses, but critics say it is a Trojan horse for liberal
*  values.
*  Finally, despite a $30 billion rescue package put together last week by the federal government
*  and rival banks, the future of First Republic Bank remained uncertain on Monday.
*  Its share price fell by nearly half, and The Times reports that over the past two weeks,
*  its customers have pulled out nearly $70 billion in deposits.
*  Today's episode was produced by Nina Feldman, Shannon Lin and Mursady.
*  It was edited by Rachel Cuester and Michael Benoit, contains original music by Marian
*  Lozano and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsferk of Wonder Lee.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  See you tomorrow.
