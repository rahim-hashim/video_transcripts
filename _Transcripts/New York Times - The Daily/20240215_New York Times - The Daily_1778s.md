# How China Broke One Manâ€™s Dreams
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovNtkI-Zs6Y)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  A crisis of confidence is brewing inside China, where the heavy hand of the government is
*  turning true believers in the Chinese dream into skeptics willing to flee the country.
*  My colleague, Li Yuan, on how that crisis is now showing up at the U.S.-Mexico border.
*  It's Thursday, February 15th.
*  Li, you write about China for the Times.
*  Tell us how it is that you first came to this story.
*  You know, I watch a lot of Chinese social media for my job.
*  And in early 2023, I started seeing something quite surprising for me.
*  I saw all these videos on social media of Chinese people crossing the U.S. border with
*  Mexico by taking the route, what we call the daring gap.
*  And most people taking the daring gap are from Venezuela, Ecuador, and Haiti.
*  But what felt so unusual for Chinese people taking this journey is that unlike these other
*  groups, these Chinese are fleeing the world's second largest economy.
*  Right.
*  They are not in most of the public's imagination in the same boat as the migrants from any
*  of the countries we think of where people are fleeing violence and poverty and taking
*  this very dangerous route, the daring gap.
*  Yeah.
*  And how many Chinese migrants are we talking about here?
*  You know, last year in 2023, 24,000 Chinese crossed the southern border.
*  24,000.
*  Yeah, that's more than the previous 10 years combined.
*  Wow.
*  And if we step back and look at the history, China used to be a big country for migration.
*  A lot of people were trying very hard to leave China in 1980s when China was a very poor
*  country.
*  And then as the economy grew, life became much better.
*  The opportunities were abundant and there were hundreds of millions of Chinese middle
*  class.
*  By 2012, very few Chinese were leaving.
*  And about 80% of Chinese who studied abroad, people like me, went back to China because
*  why leave China, right?
*  You could have Chinese dream.
*  As a play on the American dream, right?
*  Yeah, the American dream.
*  You know, we grew up watching Hollywood movies.
*  You know, we all know the term and then the Communist Party kind of...
*  Co-opted it?
*  Co-opted the term and became the Chinese dream and many Chinese bought into that.
*  But in recent years, the numbers of people leaving China have again started to go up.
*  And actually, hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens left the country last year.
*  And the Chinese migrants who crossed the Tharing Gap represent those who are going to the most
*  extreme lengths to leave the country.
*  And so I've been really interested in finding out why are they doing this?
*  And what do you come to understand about why thousands of Chinese migrants are making this
*  journey?
*  What explains it?
*  It might be better if I can give you an example, a man I met.
*  Hi, Mr. Gao, hello.
*  His name is Gao Zhibin.
*  He is 39 years old and he thought he realized the Chinese dream and ended up on the Tharing Gap.
*  He was born in China's eastern province, Shandong, in a poor village.
*  He said he grew up having like only two meals with meat a year.
*  And he didn't finish middle school and he worked hard labor, making very little money.
*  But he dreamed about the world outside his village.
*  So he went to work at an electronics factory in Beijing, making about $300 a month, which
*  was a fortune for him.
*  And he has a lot of street smart, you can sense it when you're talking to him.
*  So after a few years, he started working for kind of like a human resources company, recruiting
*  factory workers just like him.
*  And then by 2007, he made some money.
*  And he leased a plot of land on the outskirts of Beijing and built an apartment building
*  and rented it out to migrant workers.
*  So he basically becomes a small scale, almost developer.
*  Yeah, a very small scale developer.
*  And he did pretty well.
*  You know, he was making about $30,000 a year, which was pretty good money for anybody in
*  China at the time.
*  And he got married and he had a daughter.
*  And a few years later, he had a son.
*  He moved his parents from their village to Beijing, which was a big success in Chinese
*  culture.
*  And he really believed he kind of made it.
*  And his life was only going to become better and better.
*  What you're describing feels like a middle class existence in China's capital, a success
*  story, not exactly the kind of person you would expect to leave China.
*  Yeah, you know, the Chinese government likes talking about hundreds of millions of Chinese
*  lifted out of poverty.
*  You know, he was one of them.
*  But then in 2018, everything changed for Gao.
*  He got a notice from the local government that they wanted to take back the land he
*  leased and tear down the apartment building he had built.
*  The building he had built and subdivided.
*  Yeah.
*  The government wanted to use the land to sell it for big bucks to bigger developers.
*  Essentially, the government just wants to override the lease that he has for this land.
*  They just don't seem to respect it.
*  And they're putting up the sign and saying to him, it's over.
*  Yeah.
*  And the government ordered everyone in Gao's building to leave.
*  And Gao is like, no way.
*  And he refused to leave.
*  But the government cut off the water, the power, and they throw away the tenants' belongings
*  on the street.
*  Wow.
*  And they dumped toilet sewage in the yard because they wanted to make it unlivable for
*  the people.
*  And then on that day, when the government came with police and bulldozers to tear the
*  building down, he said he stood on the roof of the building.
*  He said he was so angry, his eyes just blacked out.
*  He had a brick in his hand.
*  A brick in his hand?
*  Yes.
*  He wanted to throw it and fight the police, the government officials.
*  And his mom knelt down in front of him, begged him not to fight.
*  You can't fight the government.
*  Just get over with it.
*  Carry on with your life.
*  Hello.
*  And he told me he just cried.
*  So what does Gao end up doing after the government takes away his land and this building?
*  Well, Gao didn't want to give up.
*  He decided to go to the higher authority, the central government, to petition his case.
*  He thought at least he could demand some compensation for what he had lost.
*  But during that process, he said he and his family started getting harassed by local
*  authorities.
*  They even went to his children's school to ask the students with the same last name,
*  Gao, to stand up.
*  To stand up in the classroom?
*  To intimidate, basically.
*  It got so bad that he legally divorced his wife to try to trick the authorities to stop
*  harassing her and her parents.
*  And meanwhile, he had lost income from the apartment building.
*  He was trying to make a living doing odd jobs.
*  And this went on for several years.
*  And at the end of it, Gao got absolutely nothing in return for the loss of his property.
*  And at that time, he started to think about his world.
*  He said,
*  I felt like I suddenly woke up.
*  He said, you know, he just found out there's no way to pursue justice in his country.
*  He told me, I felt like I finally saw through this country's reality, saw right through it.
*  His outlook for the country and for his own future just became very dark.
*  That was what he said.
*  So at this point, it seems safe to say that his version of the Chinese dream has collapsed.
*  And I wonder, as he's telling you this story, Li, what you make of it.
*  To be honest, if you are China correspondent, you cover China, this is the type of story you'll hear again and again.
*  The space for the society just shrank so much in the past decade or so under the government of Xi Jinping.
*  It has become really hard for people from all kinds of social economic backgrounds.
*  You can get into trouble for anything, for being a Uighur, Christian, Muslim,
*  or you're just an ordinary online user just making a comment on social media.
*  Or you're just a Communist Party cadre who has a copy of a banned book and you can be in trouble.
*  The police can show up at your door in the middle of the night, the knock on the door.
*  And everything goes away.
*  Yeah, you just live in constant fear.
*  And all of these are happening at the same time when the unemployment rate is rising.
*  And the Chinese economy is falling apart.
*  People just can't see where their future is going to be.
*  The loss of confidence is you can feel it in the air.
*  That's what people told me.
*  So this is the moment that the idea of the Chinese dream,
*  you work very hard and the life will become better,
*  kind of is clashing with the reality of the Chinese government.
*  And it's this moment that Gao saw the videos I saw on social media
*  of people crossing the Bering Gap.
*  And he thought to himself that I can do this too.
*  We'll be right back.
*  One scow decides to leave China.
*  Why does he decide to leave this way?
*  Why not go to a nearby neighboring country in Asia?
*  Why not go to Europe?
*  Why travel across the ocean to the US through such a particularly terrifyingly dangerous route as the Bering Gap?
*  Yeah, for many Chinese people, you know, it's pretty obvious that the US is the country they should move to.
*  Because it is the wealthiest country in the world.
*  And the wages are much higher here than in most countries.
*  And also the US still looms large in the imagination of Chinese people, you know,
*  for many people the American dream never died.
*  The problem is, it's not easy for ordinary Chinese people like Gao
*  to get any kinds of visa to go directly to the US.
*  But Chinese passport holders can fly directly to Ecuador without a visa.
*  And from there, there's a well-traveled path to the Bering Gap.
*  So many Chinese people just think that going from Ecuador to the Bering Gap
*  is actually one of the best options for them to get to the United States.
*  But how aware is Gao of what is entailed in walking from Ecuador
*  to the US border through that landscape?
*  He was aware of the danger.
*  He told me he knew that people died on the route.
*  But he told me his life was so risky, so dangerous, so uncertain.
*  In China, he decided he might just as well leave to start a new life.
*  Gao had never been out of China, and he didn't even have a passport.
*  He applied for a passport after he decided to leave.
*  And he also convinced his family to let him bring his eldest child,
*  his 13-year-old daughter, to come with him.
*  And they left Beijing late February last year.
*  They flew to Turkey and then to Ecuador,
*  and got connected with smugglers who took them to the Bering Gap.
*  It was such a brutal journey, Gao told me.
*  On the first day, he had sunstroke.
*  On the second day, he could barely walk.
*  And his daughter vomited and fainted on the ground.
*  I asked him what was going through his mind during the journey.
*  He said it was despair.
*  But he just told his daughter, we have to keep going.
*  We can't get left behind.
*  The journey took 35 days.
*  They reached the border in late March and crossed from Mexico into Texas.
*  They were taken by border control agents.
*  Gao told his story about what he's experienced in China, and he was let go.
*  This is where it feels like Gao's story seems to intersect with a very long-running story in
*  the United States, which is what's going on at the border.
*  Thousands, tens of thousands a week, migrants showing up at that southern border seeking
*  asylum.
*  And because there's such a backlog to process the applications, folks are led into the US
*  and remain here.
*  That seems to be what happened to Gao and his daughter.
*  Yeah, Gao and his daughter, they were lucky.
*  They were let go within 48 hours.
*  And immigration agents sent them to San Francisco, and that's where he and his daughter
*  have been ever since.
*  And what does his life look like in San Francisco?
*  So Gao and his daughter are living in a studio apartment at a housing shelter there.
*  He got a work permit and has been working delivering packages for $2 per package.
*  He gets up at 6 a.m. every morning, and his daughter has to get up around the same time
*  because she cannot be at the family shelter alone.
*  So she would stay at the KFC until it's school time.
*  He works really, really long hours.
*  And he told me he cries when he thinks about leaving her alone.
*  This sounds like a very difficult existence.
*  I mean, the kind of difficult existence that might make somebody wonder if they had made
*  the right decision.
*  You know, life isn't easy for him and his daughter, but Gao is focusing on what the
*  US is giving him.
*  He said the Chinese government took away his building, and he can't believe the US
*  government gave him an apartment to live for free.
*  And one thing he emphasized is the freedom he has here.
*  He doesn't need to fear for the knock on the door anymore.
*  I asked him, are you idolizing the US too much?
*  And he kept telling me no, no, no.
*  I never regretted my decision of coming here.
*  And he told me a story of one afternoon in November when Xi Jinping was in San Francisco
*  to meet with President Biden.
*  And Gao saw on social media that there would be a protest in San Francisco.
*  So he actually took the day off and went downtown.
*  He said he joined a group of protesters and started chanting, Xi Jinping step down.
*  And he was actually interviewed by a Chinese media outlet at the scene.
*  He sent me the clip and the reporter asked him, why are you here?
*  He said, freedom is great.
*  Then he shouted, lonely freedom.
*  Xi Jinping stepped down.
*  He told me he felt amazing.
*  He said, in China, I wouldn't dare say that.
*  But this heart felt worse.
*  And I could finally shout them out.
*  He said he felt like a completely different person after that.
*  Hmm.
*  So what's the most likely outcome of this story for Gao?
*  What do you think is going to happen to him?
*  So Gao applied for political asylum in May and he's waiting to see if it will be granted.
*  In the meantime, he dreams of one day settling down again in his own house, not in a shelter.
*  And he also wants to be reunited with his family.
*  Right, which of course, the majority of which is still back in China.
*  Yeah.
*  For now, he tells his wife that he will be able to get a green card soon, which he says is a lie.
*  In reality, he's not certain what will happen to him.
*  And, you know, a lot of people like him who made a similar journey here ended up going back to China.
*  When I talked to them, they said things are just too hard.
*  But Gao said even if he can't make it here,
*  he will never go back to China as long as the Communist Party is in power.
*  Mm.
*  Gao would seem to be exactly the kind of person on paper that China wouldn't want to lose.
*  He's somebody who made the journey that, as you said, China is so proud of, from rural China to urban China,
*  who tried to create a business, a development, did so, brought his family to the big city,
*  and yet he'd rather risk his life and flee to the United States through the jungle than endure
*  this version of China's government.
*  And based on your reporting, hundreds of thousands of others are doing the same thing.
*  And yet the reality is that China is a country of huge numbers.
*  Yeah, 1.4 billion people.
*  Right. So even if hundreds of thousands of Chinese people are leaving,
*  that's still a pretty small proportion of the population.
*  So is what we're experiencing here, what you're documenting, a threat to China's future
*  and something that it's going to be taking seriously?
*  Or is this just the cost of the authoritarian political model that China now has under Xi?
*  And can it therefore tolerate this outflow?
*  I don't think any country should take this lightly.
*  It is a serious problem for any government.
*  You know, in the past year, I wrote about Chinese entrepreneurs, young professionals,
*  intellectuals, artists, filmmakers, all kinds of people leaving because they couldn't suffer
*  it anymore. There's even a term for that called running away from China is among the most popular
*  passwords in China last year. Everybody talks about where they should move to, what their options
*  are. My friends told me that it's also one of the hottest topics on dinner tables in China.
*  When people sit around and really get to talking and they get under their cups, you're saying
*  they talk about fleeing.
*  Yeah, people are obsessed with this. I think what Gao and many people are doing is starting
*  to look like the beginning of a great exodus of China when the government became so harsh
*  on its people, when the economy is not doing well and people can't vote for their leaders.
*  Some people decided there's only one way to vote. That's with their feet.
*  That was what Gao and many people did. And I believe many more people are going to do that.
*  Olly, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  A rocket fired from Lebanon struck a base in Israel, killing an Israeli soldier and
*  wounding eight others and prompting a massive response from the Israeli government. Hours
*  later, Israel carried out extensive airstrikes on southern Lebanon that killed at least four people.
*  The exchanges represent the kind of deadly tit-for-tat that could quickly spiral into
*  a direct conflict between Israel and Lebanon, which Israel has twice invaded in the past.
*  And a celebration of the Kansas City Chief's Super Bowl victory has turned into America's
*  latest mass shooting. One person was killed and at least 21 others were injured,
*  nine of them children. Kansas City police said they had detained three people in connection
*  with the shooting, but offered few details and no motive. Today's episode was produced by Stella
*  Tan, Shannon Lin, and Jessica Chung. It was edited by MJ Davis Lin with help from Michael Benoit and
*  Paige Cowitt, contains original music by Marian Lozano, Rowan Yamisto, and Dan Powell, and was
*  engineered by Chris Wood. That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Bavaro. See you tomorrow.
