# ICE on Campus
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=4.58s)]
*  Today, the story of three Columbia students targeted for deportation by the Trump administration [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=9.72s)]
*  and why immigration arrests are happening at universities across the country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=19.8s)]
*  My colleague Hamed Ali-Aziz, on what these cases reveal about the latest immigration [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=25.28s)]
*  crackdown and this administration's views on free speech. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=29.48s)]
*  It's Monday, March 31st. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=35.96s)]
*  Hamed, it feels like you can't go more than a few days without hearing about another college [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=39.84s)]
*  campus or another college student that has been targeted by immigration officials. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  One thing that seems to have been really making the rounds the last week is this video of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=55.72s)]
*  a student at Tufts getting detained on the street by immigration agents. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=60.88s)]
*  It's kind of a shocking video. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=65.44s)]
*  Her case feels like this larger pattern that we've been seeing recently with the targeting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=67.0s)]
*  of students. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=72.76s)]
*  I want to talk to you about what is happening here and what your understanding is of this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=73.76s)]
*  moment that we are in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=77.68s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=78.84s)]
*  We saw at the beginning of the Trump administration a real focus on cracking down and arresting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=81.08s)]
*  undocumented immigrants in the country, particularly those with criminal histories. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=87.48s)]
*  At the same time, making a note that if you're undocumented in this country, we're going [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=93.28s)]
*  to come find you, we're going to come get you, and we're going to remove you from America. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=98.16s)]
*  But what's happening now is targeting of people who were legally in the country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=102.72s)]
*  They were here with student visas, in some cases with green cards. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=108.38s)]
*  The Trump administration is looking to target individuals that they believe are spreading [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=113.32s)]
*  messages that they disagree with, and they believe that are counter to the foreign policy [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=119.14s)]
*  interests of the United States. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=124.17999999999999s)]
*  And this all actually starts with a talk by President Trump during his campaign. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=125.78s)]
*  During that time, he was watching these protests at Columbia. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=132.04s)]
*  When I'm president, we will not allow our colleges to be taken over by violent radicals. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  He said that if there were any international students involved, their visas should be revoked [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=142.32s)]
*  and they should be removed from the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=148.18s)]
*  If you come here from another country and try to bring jihadism or anti-Americanism [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=151.22s)]
*  or anti-Semitism to our campuses, we will immediately deport you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=156.86s)]
*  You'll be out of that school. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=161.34s)]
*  And when he comes into office, quickly in those first few days where there's a dizzying [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=163.78s)]
*  number of executive orders, he deputizes the Department of Justice and the Department of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=168.33999999999997s)]
*  Homeland Security to create a task force, combating anti-Semitism and targeting college [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=174.22s)]
*  campuses as places of focus. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  We weren't clear how it was all going to play out. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=184.78s)]
*  And in recent weeks, we've seen the Trump administration start to use those ideas to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=187.66s)]
*  target students on college campuses. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=191.94s)]
*  And I've been covering three of those cases involving students at Columbia that, taken [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=195.1s)]
*  together, I think, paint a clearer picture of what the Trump administration is up to. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=200.14s)]
*  I have to assume that one of those cases is one of the first cases that we saw come out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=205.7s)]
*  of all of this, the case of Mahmoud Khalil, the former Columbia student who was arrested [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  on campus housing in early March. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=214.34s)]
*  Definitely, his case was a massive news story when it first happened in early March. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=216.74s)]
*  And people were trying to figure out why he was picked up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=223.26s)]
*  We learned from sources that actually Secretary of State Rubio had issued a memo designating [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=228.02s)]
*  two people as deportable because of their protest activity. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=235.9s)]
*  And one of those people was Mahmoud Khalil, a very visible protester on Columbia's campus. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=242.3s)]
*  He was arrested on March 8th at his Columbia University apartment complex. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=254.02s)]
*  His wife actually videotaped the arrest. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=263.74s)]
*  And in the video you can see the plainclothes officers telling Mr. Khalil that he's going [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=268.26s)]
*  to be arrested, that they're going to be taking him away. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=274.94s)]
*  At the same time, Mr. Khalil is telling his wife, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=283.74s)]
*  just call his lawyer. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=289.62s)]
*  Yeah, they just handcuffed him and I don't know what to do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=291.14s)]
*  He was picked up and sent to Louisiana where he was detained in an ICE detention facility. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=298.06s)]
*  And that's really striking because Khalil is not here on a visa. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=304.18s)]
*  He actually has permanent residency and a green card. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=309.26s)]
*  Can they do that? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=313.3s)]
*  I mean, can they detain a green card holder? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=314.3s)]
*  I remember when we first learned about this case, a lot of people, myself included, thought [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=316.3s)]
*  the answer was no. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  Green card holders can be detained. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=322.34s)]
*  After you receive your green card, you have to wait a certain number of years to receive [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=324.56s)]
*  your U.S. citizenship. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=329.82s)]
*  But during that time, you need to remain in good standing in the United States. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=332.94s)]
*  And one of the things that oftentimes green card holders will be picked up by ICE for [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=337.5s)]
*  is committing certain crimes, more serious crimes. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  In this case, obviously, there is no crime that's been pointed to by the U.S. government. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=345.98s)]
*  Instead, it's this provision cited by Secretary of State Rubio. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=352.06s)]
*  And what is the legal ground that Rubio is citing? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  They arrested him under this provision in the immigration law that allows the secretary [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=360.82s)]
*  of state to deem someone deportable if their continued presence in the United States undermines [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  U.S. foreign policy. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=373.04s)]
*  In the case of Mr. Jalil, they say that his involvement in protests at Columbia University [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=375.06s)]
*  was part of this anti-Semitic activity. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=381.5s)]
*  And this undermines U.S. foreign policy interests of combating anti-Semitism across the world. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=385.74s)]
*  What they're referring to in some of these accusations seems to be a speech issue. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=392.82s)]
*  I mean, I know they're talking about things that sound like terrorism, but they're really [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=396.97999999999996s)]
*  criticizing, it seems, his protest activity. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  And one thing I still don't quite understand about his story is this question of freedom [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=403.82s)]
*  of speech. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=407.66s)]
*  Like, even though he's not a citizen, is he still entitled to the protections of a citizen [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=408.66s)]
*  because he's in this country? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=414.5s)]
*  It's complicated. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=417.06s)]
*  The Supreme Court has said that non-citizens do have the right to freedom of speech under [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=418.06s)]
*  the First Amendment, but the government has an immense amount of power to remove immigrants [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=422.58000000000004s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=430.66s)]
*  Ultimately, anything outside of being a U.S. citizen is a privilege that can be revoked [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=432.38s)]
*  by the federal government. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=438.86s)]
*  And in this case, the Trump administration is trying to say that actions that would otherwise [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=441.06s)]
*  be protected in the First Amendment, like protest activity on a college campus, could [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=446.94s)]
*  merit deportation. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=453.7s)]
*  So basically, no, you don't ultimately have freedom of speech. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=455.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's clear that they're targeting people for this type of speech, including Mr. Khalil, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=458.94s)]
*  using every resource possible to pick him up and arrest him. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  Recently, they added allegations in his immigration case to try to deport him, saying that he [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=470.7s)]
*  had not disclosed past work. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=475.85999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=477.97999999999996s)]
*  It feels like they're basically trying everything to send a message. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=478.97999999999996s)]
*  Moreover, it kind of feels like his case is maybe potentially the beginning of something. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=483.14s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=489.46s)]
*  It feels like the beginning of this targeting of international students across the United [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=490.46s)]
*  States. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=496.74s)]
*  And we quickly learned that there was another case of an international student at Columbia, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=498.06s)]
*  but this was a student who was not someone who was as prominent as Mr. Khalil. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=504.06s)]
*  Tell me about that case. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=509.5s)]
*  Her name is Ranjani Srinivasan, and she's a PhD student here on a student visa from [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=511.58s)]
*  India. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=519.06s)]
*  And my colleague, Luis Ferre, gets on the phone with her and starts talking to her about [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=520.66s)]
*  her story and what she experienced. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=527.5799999999999s)]
*  She had received an email in early March from the State Department saying that her visa [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=530.06s)]
*  was revoked. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=537.42s)]
*  And she's trying to figure out what's going on with her status in the United States. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=538.7s)]
*  It's important to note that for international students here, that's a very serious issue. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=544.46s)]
*  And so there's a lot of stress involved with that. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=551.82s)]
*  Around that time, ICE comes to her door. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  Does Ranjani live here? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=556.5s)]
*  Her roommate actually is at the door and starts a recording. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=558.5s)]
*  I do not consent to answering any questions, but have a good day. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=564.42s)]
*  Hey, Ranjani, if this is you, listen, you were here yesterday, we're here today, we're [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=569.18s)]
*  going to be here tonight, tomorrow. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=574.5799999999999s)]
*  You're probably scared. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=576.9s)]
*  If you are, I get it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=578.16s)]
*  And they're seeking to pick her up. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=580.3s)]
*  The reality is your visa was revoked. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=583.18s)]
*  Okay? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=585.74s)]
*  You are now amenable to removal proceedings. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=586.74s)]
*  Okay? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=589.3s)]
*  If you'd like to have an... [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=590.3s)]
*  Does she know why ICE agents are at her door? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=591.5s)]
*  Does she know why they're trying to get her? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=593.82s)]
*  She doesn't. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=596.7s)]
*  But eventually, she realizes that she's likely being targeted because she was swept up during [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=597.7s)]
*  the increase in protests on Columbia's campus. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=605.22s)]
*  She had been arrested amongst another group of protesters in the area, but she says she [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=608.9s)]
*  was arrested during a time when she was trying to get home. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=614.7s)]
*  She was working her way back to her house and she was picked up by police at the time. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=617.9s)]
*  Now those charges were eventually dropped, so she didn't really make much of a deal of [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=623.42s)]
*  it at the time. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=628.18s)]
*  She didn't disclose it on her visa paperwork. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=630.06s)]
*  But ultimately, the US government cites that as the reason for her visa being revoked. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=633.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay, wait, so to be clear, was she protesting that day? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=639.62s)]
*  Was she a protester at all? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=643.02s)]
*  She says that this was really merely her trying to get home and getting through this crowd [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=644.92s)]
*  and the police come and arrest her. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=651.38s)]
*  She described herself as a lazy protester. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=653.54s)]
*  She did post stuff online in support of pro-Palestine efforts, but that was the extent of it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=656.14s)]
*  And she sees what's happened to Mr. Khalil and doesn't want to be swept up by ICE and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=662.9s)]
*  targeted for detention in a ICE detention center. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=669.58s)]
*  And she decides to leave the country to go to Canada and to avoid all of that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=674.26s)]
*  She self-deports. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=680.74s)]
*  That self-deportation, that actually feels like it's one of the administration's goals [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=682.5s)]
*  here, right? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=686.54s)]
*  Like getting people to flee on their own. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=687.54s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=689.78s)]
*  Self-deportation is a major goal of the Trump administration. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=690.78s)]
*  There is no feasible way for them to deport millions of people without major numbers of [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=694.86s)]
*  immigrants. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=701.34s)]
*  Self-deporting, leaving the country, boosting to those numbers that President Trump has [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=702.34s)]
*  said he will hit. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  This is something that is constantly talked about with the Trump administration, which [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=708.76s)]
*  is leave before we come and find you. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=713.36s)]
*  And in this case, it seemed to have worked. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=716.8s)]
*  She saw what happened to Mr. Khalil and did not want to end up like him being sent to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=718.96s)]
*  an ICE detention center. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=723.38s)]
*  This case shows us that the government is claiming these broad deportation powers and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=728.76s)]
*  attempting to use those powers to deport international students here to study in the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=733.92s)]
*  United States. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=739.88s)]
*  Then we heard about another case, a third case involving another university student [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=743.92s)]
*  that really surprised people who've been following immigration and immigration enforcement [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=750.36s)]
*  for years. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=757.08s)]
*  Ahmed, you've just explained these two cases that help us understand how the administration [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=775.24s)]
*  is really testing all these new theories about how to get people out of the country. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  Tell us about that third case you just mentioned. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=784.08s)]
*  Definitely this third case, it's a 21-year-old student, Yoon Seo Chung, who grew up in America, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=786.5600000000001s)]
*  essentially. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=794.4000000000001s)]
*  She was born in Korea, but she came to the United States at age seven, and she lived [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=795.4000000000001s)]
*  her life in America. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=801.84s)]
*  Her whole community is here. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=803.1600000000001s)]
*  Her family is here. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=805.36s)]
*  Her parents are here. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=807.0s)]
*  She went through high school in America where she became a valedictorian. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=809.1800000000001s)]
*  Essentially, her home is the United States, and that is something that her lawyers really [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=815.84s)]
*  emphasized in their lawsuit against the US government. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=821.1800000000001s)]
*  This isn't someone who came here specifically to go to school and then plans to head back [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=825.0600000000001s)]
*  home. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=829.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=830.12s)]
*  I think it's significant for emotional reasons because she has such deep ties to this country. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=831.12s)]
*  She went to high school in the United States. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=837.32s)]
*  She has a network in the United States. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=840.08s)]
*  But I think more importantly, it undercuts the Trump administration's argument with these [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=843.16s)]
*  arrests. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=848.4s)]
*  The Trump administration has said that these people who are coming to study in the United [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=849.84s)]
*  States are guests in our country. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=854.38s)]
*  While they're here, it's not appropriate for them to cause a ruckus on our campuses [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=856.76s)]
*  and cause conflict. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=862.92s)]
*  But in this case, Chung is not, for all intents and purposes, a temporary guest who just came [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=865.84s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=872.52s)]
*  She's been here since she was seven years old. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  So how does it become clear that she's being targeted? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=877.6s)]
*  Can you kind of walk us through her story a little bit? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=879.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=881.92s)]
*  So earlier this month in March, she attended a sit-in on Columbia University's campus, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=882.92s)]
*  and she was arrested by police alongside other college protesters. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  And soon after that, ICE shows up to her parents' house. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=894.6s)]
*  And the same time that the ICE officer showed up to Chung's house, she received a text message [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  from an unknown number, and it said, quote, this is Audrey from the police. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=905.32s)]
*  My job is to reach out to you and see if you have any questions about your recent arrests [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=912.28s)]
*  and the process going forward. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=917.0s)]
*  A federal prosecutor speaks with her attorney saying that the State Department has revoked [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=919.32s)]
*  her status and that the government is trying to find her and detain her. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=926.36s)]
*  They're really using all the resources that the government has to try to arrest her. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=932.2s)]
*  I think that's a really important point to make because, look, ICE arrests are really [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=940.04s)]
*  difficult. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=945.0s)]
*  They have to expend a lot of resources and research and surveillance to know when people [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=946.0s)]
*  are going to be around to show up, to arrest them, and take them away. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=951.3000000000001s)]
*  They're using all these various levers of government power to try to locate her. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=956.24s)]
*  And that's a lot of resources for a government that's incredibly strained for resources and [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=964.16s)]
*  trying to reach these high numbers of deportations. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=969.96s)]
*  Every resource matters, and they're using it on a college student who's been in the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=973.72s)]
*  country since she was seven years old. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=979.04s)]
*  So where is she now? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=981.16s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=982.92s)]
*  Her lawyers have not told us where she is, but they say that she is in the United States. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=983.92s)]
*  Because she's concerned about having her location disclosed. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=991.0799999999999s)]
*  That is a fair assumption. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=994.56s)]
*  And it feels worth noting, actually, that these aggressive tactics kind of come back [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=996.92s)]
*  to this whole messaging element of the administration's tactic here. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  They're trying to send a message that we will come for you, we will find you, and that also [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1006.16s)]
*  helps kind of put the fear into people that would lead them to self-deport, which is another [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1012.68s)]
*  huge element to the administration's approach to all of this. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  And it feels like this is all much broader than just what's happening at Columbia. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1022.04s)]
*  Totally. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1025.8s)]
*  We've seen ICE target international students across the country, including at Georgetown, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1026.8s)]
*  of course, with the case at Tufts, with the Turkish international students, and at Cornell [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1035.28s)]
*  as well. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1042.32s)]
*  And it's becoming pretty clear that this is a part of the Trump administration's new [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1043.56s)]
*  phase of their immigration crackdown. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1050.32s)]
*  Let me just send this message out. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1052.32s)]
*  If you apply for a visa to enter the United States and be a student, and you tell... [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1054.36s)]
*  Marco Rubio, Trump's secretary of state, has spoken very publicly about this new phase. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1058.04s)]
*  We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1064.86s)]
*  that tears up our university campuses. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1069.8s)]
*  And once your visa is revoked, you are in the country illegally, and the United States [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1072.08s)]
*  has the right to deport you from this country. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1077.3999999999999s)]
*  Is there some advantage to targeting students in particular, or people who are here on student [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1081.3999999999999s)]
*  visas or green cards? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1087.56s)]
*  Well, people here on student visas are in regular contact with the U.S. government. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  They are constantly updating their information with the U.S. government to remain in status. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1096.64s)]
*  This is something that they do willingly and proactively because they want to pursue their [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1103.8000000000002s)]
*  education in the United States. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1109.4s)]
*  So there is a whole wealth of information about where these people are. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1110.88s)]
*  You can just look at where they're studying, right? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1117.16s)]
*  They are much easier to find than compared to undocumented immigrants, who oftentimes [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1119.76s)]
*  will remain under the radar and try to avoid interacting with the government for fear of [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1125.04s)]
*  being picked up by ICE and arrested. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1134.04s)]
*  These are individuals who have shared a lot of information with the U.S. government. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think in many ways, it confirms a lot of fears that people have that when you share [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1142.8s)]
*  so much information with the government, you inevitably become easier to find and detain. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1150.28s)]
*  It really feels ironic the way that you're explaining it, that the people that are most [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1157.8s)]
*  deportable are actually people that are in the system, following the rules, going through [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1161.48s)]
*  the procedures, as opposed to people who are undocumented. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1166.32s)]
*  It also feels worth saying that these schools where ICE is targeting students, they don't [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1170.48s)]
*  really seem to be going out of their way to fight it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1175.6399999999999s)]
*  This is a new test for them. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1179.68s)]
*  This is not something that they've seen in the past where you have ICE officers on campuses. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1181.0s)]
*  It's important to note here that previous to the Trump administration, there were actually [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1188.96s)]
*  guidelines in place for ICE to not enforce on campuses. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1193.88s)]
*  So this is a new front in that respect. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1199.0800000000002s)]
*  And at the same time, universities are under immense pressure from the Trump administration [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1202.28s)]
*  targeting their funding, targeting their practices. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1208.84s)]
*  Columbia in particular has been under attack. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1212.76s)]
*  So when it comes to these cases, they're in many ways taking a hands-off approach. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1216.3999999999999s)]
*  At this point, does it feel like the Trump administration's arrest of these students [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1222.04s)]
*  will hold up an immigration court? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1226.04s)]
*  Like basically, are these laws, which in some cases are arcane or kind of obscure, do you [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1227.68s)]
*  think that those will be compelling enough? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1232.24s)]
*  So two things. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1235.92s)]
*  One, the State Department has wide powers to revoke people's student visas. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1237.24s)]
*  And that's going to be a particularly difficult case for those individuals who are here simply [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1244.04s)]
*  on student visas trying to remain in the United States. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1250.1200000000001s)]
*  It's going to be an uphill battle in immigration court. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1254.52s)]
*  But when it comes to the provision being used against the green card holders, this idea [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1258.6000000000001s)]
*  that the Secretary of State can deem someone deportable, remove them from the United States [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1264.36s)]
*  because they undermine foreign policy interests, that's been tested before in immigration courts. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1269.84s)]
*  And actually, the Board of Immigration Appeals at the time in the 90s upheld the U.S. government's [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1277.12s)]
*  efforts to deport a high-ranking Mexican official to Mexico. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1285.72s)]
*  But that was a very different case. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1291.28s)]
*  This is a very different situation, so it's unclear. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1293.6s)]
*  I mean, that's actually something that I wanted to ask you about, because we've talked a lot [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1297.0s)]
*  so far about how some of these cases feel surprising or extreme. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1301.1599999999999s)]
*  But I just want to make sure I understand, how do these cases fit into what we've seen [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1304.6799999999998s)]
*  historically? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1310.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there have been several times in American history where the government has been much [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1311.1999999999998s)]
*  tougher on immigration. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1317.0s)]
*  But you don't have to look back that far. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1319.36s)]
*  You can point to this time after 9-11, this era where DHS was born in the wake of that [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1321.1s)]
*  terrorist attack. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1330.12s)]
*  We saw at that time targeting of Muslim immigrants who were here on student visas, who were swept [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1331.86s)]
*  up in this increased immigration enforcement because there was a real fear around Muslim [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1339.2199999999998s)]
*  immigrants who were here on visas because, of course, the 9-11 attackers had arrived [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1345.98s)]
*  as well on visas. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1352.58s)]
*  And I think it also fits into this context of the government talking about these people [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1354.66s)]
*  as potential threats, right? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1361.98s)]
*  I mean, we see that the White House has said that Khalil is aligned with Hamas, a terrorist [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1364.58s)]
*  And we've seen them call Srinivasan a terrorist sympathizer. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1373.66s)]
*  We're seeing almost the same type of language being used to describe the immigrants who [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1378.22s)]
*  are being picked up right now as we saw during that time in the post-9-11 era. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1383.74s)]
*  I realize that the government might claim that the people it is targeting, in some cases [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1389.6200000000001s)]
*  at least, are supporting terrorist activity. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1394.66s)]
*  And so it's totally fair to use the language of the 9-11 terrorists. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1396.9s)]
*  But it really feels like a huge stretch to say that somebody who wrote an op-ed is comparable [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1400.26s)]
*  to somebody who flies a plane into the World Trade Center. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1407.5s)]
*  And so it can't help but feel like this is not as much about terrorism as it is about [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1411.78s)]
*  free speech. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1417.14s)]
*  And if that is the case, and if you agree with that premise, it feels like we are escalating [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1418.68s)]
*  in one direction. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1423.46s)]
*  And I am curious what you think that that crackdown looks like to you in the next four [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1424.98s)]
*  years. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1430.1s)]
*  Yeah, already people here on legal status who have green cards are certainly terrified. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1431.1s)]
*  There's a lot of uncertainty amongst green card holders about what these cases mean for [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1438.1s)]
*  themselves. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1443.1799999999998s)]
*  We're not even 100 days in, and we're already seeing green card holders picked up. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1449.4199999999998s)]
*  These types of incredibly powerful images of students arrested on their campuses. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1456.1000000000001s)]
*  And as far as what comes next, I think it's fair to say that anything is possible, right? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1463.54s)]
*  We saw in the first administration there was an effort to expand denaturalization of U.S. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1470.3200000000002s)]
*  citizens. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1477.7s)]
*  I think we can expect more of those types of efforts and others that we're not aware [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1478.7s)]
*  of at this moment. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1482.8200000000002s)]
*  Hamid, thank you so much for your time. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1486.94s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1490.8600000000001s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1509.8600000000001s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1516.8600000000001s)]
*  President Trump said in an interview with NBC on Sunday that he was, quote, not joking [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1519.92s)]
*  about possibly seeking a third term. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1524.5s)]
*  It was the most serious he's been about an idea that he's mused about in the past, and [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1527.66s)]
*  it would run afoul of the 22nd Amendment. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1531.8600000000001s)]
*  But Trump said that there were, quote, methods to extend his presidency. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1534.66s)]
*  President Trump also told NBC News that he would not fire anyone involved in a group [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1539.7s)]
*  chat that inadvertently disclosed plans for airstrikes on Yemen to a journalist. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1543.66s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Sydney Harper, Jessica Chung, Shannon Lin, Carlos Prieto [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1551.42s)]
*  and Rochelle Bonja. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1556.26s)]
*  It was edited by M.J. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1557.98s)]
*  Davis Lin, Paige Cowitt and Brendan Klinkenberg, contains original music by Dan Powell and [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1559.18s)]

*  I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ1EB5epvzo&t=1582.94s)]
