# Should The Government Pay for Your Bad Climate Decisions?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DZKwLaHbDw)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. This is a daily.
*  A few days ago, the Biden administration issued a report that documents how the federal government
*  itself encourages Americans to make bad decisions about living with climate change. Today, White
*  House reporter Jim Tankersley on why getting the government to encourage the right decisions
*  will be so hard. It's Friday, March 24th.
*  Jim, I arrive very skeptical that an economic report from deep inside the West Wing of the
*  White House can be interesting and sustain an episode, but I'm open minded and I'm asking
*  you to prove me wrong.
*  So first off, I'm disappointed in you. I can't believe that everyone else is not completely
*  riveted by this report. But no, here, let me sell you on why this is really important
*  and interesting.
*  Okay, please.
*  So the economic report of the president is released every year. It's put together by
*  the president's economic team and it's hundreds of pages of charts and citations and deep
*  detail about the way the economy is behaving and the way that it's going to behave going
*  forward.
*  Wait, wait, Jim, I just dozed off. I'm sorry, you're selling what here?
*  Stick with me, Michael.
*  Go ahead.
*  I will concede that in the past, some of these reports have been more targeted toward what
*  we might call a deep nerd audience.
*  A niche audience.
*  A niche audience. People like me and professional economists and policy wonks whose job it is
*  to really geek out about economic policy and projections. But in this case, this year,
*  there's a chapter that I think has big, broad, important appeal to everybody. It focuses
*  on climate change and specifically how we're going to adapt to a warming world and what
*  that's going to cost. And it reflects a goal the Biden administration has had over the
*  last couple of years to better present to the public what those risks of climate change
*  look like. And not to put too fine a point on it, but it's basically a blueprint for
*  how that adaptation might completely upend how we think about almost everything the federal
*  government does.
*  Wow.
*  How it spends money, how it encourages people to do things or not do things. It's a really
*  vividly detailed summary of all of the risks and costs of adapting to climate change or
*  not adapting to climate change.
*  All right. Well, let's stipulate now that this does sound novel and important, but we're
*  pretty far along in a climate crisis. So simply acknowledging that it will affect the federal
*  government doesn't sound hugely groundbreaking to me. I mean, just a few days ago, a UN report
*  came out that said what so many of these reports ultimately say, which is we are in enormous
*  trouble.
*  Yes. And the White House report acknowledges that. And it acknowledges that we are already
*  living with the effects of climate change. Americans are already making decisions that
*  are influenced by climate change. But what the report also lays out really starkly is
*  how much government policies as they are right now are encouraging people to take more risk
*  in the face of climate change, to do riskier things, more expensive things that they probably
*  shouldn't be doing if the world's going to keep warming like this.
*  So this report posits that our federal government, when it comes to climate change and climate
*  adaptation is kind of in its own way. It's part of the problem.
*  Yes, and gets in people's way. The places we live, the crops we plant, where we choose
*  to build homes, all are flying in the face of climate risk right now. And I think there's
*  a really easy way to understand why that is, because we subsidize a lot of behaviors through
*  direct spending or regulations or the tax code. We give people sort of a thumb on the
*  scale for stuff they should do with their lives. And that thumb was in a world where
*  the risks were not nearly what they are from a changing climate. And so if you just keep
*  with those existing policies, you create what economists call perverse incentives or moral
*  hazards. You're basically encouraging people to do the wrong things.
*  So walk us through how, according to this report, the government creates perverse incentives
*  and moral hazards when it comes to climate.
*  First, and I think this is very easy for people to understand, the way we deal with natural
*  disasters in this country, the way the federal government tries to stop them or guard against
*  them or bail people out after they happen. So let's take forest fires, for example. The
*  federal government fights fires all across the West and those fires are getting worse
*  and more damaging. And the report says, hey, if we keep fighting fires around, say, you
*  know, gated subdivisions in parts of the West that are bone dry, that will continue to encourage
*  people to live in those places when maybe they should not be taking the risks of living
*  in places that are very prone to fire. Right. The same is true with flooding. There's more
*  flooding that's being linked to climate change. And the federal government basically backstops
*  all flood insurance across the country. And so it bears the costs of people living in
*  flood zones. And when they flood more often, the government's paying the money and people
*  can sort of continue to choose to live there. Right. And of course, the federal government
*  backstops flood insurance. We've talked about this a lot on the show, because private flood
*  insurance that you could buy in theory on the open market is so prohibitively expensive
*  because it actually reflects the true cost of insuring a house in a flood zone. So the
*  government kindly, generously says, we got this, we'll take care of it. And you're saying
*  that is incentivizing bad decision making around living in flood zones.
*  Yeah, what the report says is that so long as the federal government does that, you're
*  not going to see people correctly accounting for the risks of where they live. Exactly
*  what you just said, that they are not fully pricing in, as economists call it, the risks
*  they're taking by where they're choosing to build their homes. And the costs of that end
*  up being borne by taxpayers. So people who don't live in risky areas end up subsidizing
*  the people who do. Right. And we tend not to think of this as a subsidy. We tend to
*  think of it as a rescue. It sounds like this report is starting to rebrand this as basically
*  paying people to make bad decisions. Yeah, effectively. Yes. So that's natural disasters.
*  What else does the government do, according to this report that essentially encourages
*  bad climate behavior? So another way is not just insuring homes, but also helping people
*  to buy them. So, you know, I think a lot of people know this, but some don't. The federal
*  government plays a large role in the mortgage market. It has these, what are called government
*  sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that essentially take on mortgage risk
*  private lenders. And there's all this evidence, the report cites that lenders are quietly
*  sending loans they've made to houses in risky climate areas. Think like coastal communities
*  vulnerable to sea level rise. They're sending those loans basically to the federal government.
*  If I'm a lender, and I write a mortgage for that, I might be really worried that that
*  house gets washed away as the sea level goes up. But if I can just offload that mortgage
*  to the government or to Freddie and Fannie, well, then I don't worry about it as much
*  and I'm much more willing to write the loan. And so that's what the report lays out, that
*  by being able to offload those loans to the government, private mortgage lenders are making
*  riskier loans in the face of climate change. But it's not just where we live. It's also
*  what we grow agriculture, you know, the federal government subsidizes insurance for big crops,
*  If those crops fail, for whatever reason, like there's a drought or a flood, then the
*  insurance pays out and the farmer isn't out a ton of money. What the report says, by subsidizing
*  that insurance, you're again, taking some of that risk away from farmers and encouraging
*  farmers to grow the wrong crops in the wrong places, essentially, risky behavior and piling
*  the costs on taxpayers.
*  Right, this sounds a lot like the way the federal government plays a role in home insurance
*  in flood zones. Sounds like it plays a similar role with crops being grown in climate vulnerable
*  areas. And I have to imagine this is especially problematic for farmers in the American West,
*  where there is so much drought these days.
*  Yes, but also across places like Texas, where cotton crops have been under a lot of pressure
*  and across the Midwest, I mean, there's no part of the country that's immune from climate
*  change. Right. Okay, so I recognize this is a long list of things, and that a lot of it
*  is maybe stuff that people don't associate with the federal government. But I'm going
*  to give you one more that is something everyone associates with the federal government. Medicare,
*  one of the biggest, most popular programs in American history. And the report is very
*  clear that climate change is going to affect health care spending, Medicare and Medicaid.
*  And how exactly?
*  Because climate change is a health risk, particularly for poor people who have a harder time moving
*  to get away from the effects of climate change. So if you are, say, a senior citizen living
*  in Arizona, where temperatures are getting higher every year, and you are at a higher
*  risk of heat stroke, or of respiratory disease from air pollution linked to climate change,
*  then you're going to have higher health care costs that get billed to the government. Right.
*  So one way, very simple way to think about this is that the more people are at risk from
*  heat waves and other climate related events, that's more money that it's going to cost
*  taxpayers to take care of them, and more strains on the health care system, which is a huge
*  driver of the national debt going forward. And the government might need to rethink how
*  it spends that money and how it apportions health care just to keep up.
*  I mean, one way or another, it feels like this report is essentially saying that the
*  federal government's policies are misaligned with or are misfiring in almost every corner
*  of American life when it comes to climate. And yet, Jim, just to play devil's advocate,
*  I mean, how exactly is that such a problem? Because the government's job is to help people
*  as they experience new challenges in their lives, and climate is a new challenge, and
*  the government is going to have to use its existing systems to help them. Right. So what's
*  the problem?
*  The Biden administration would absolutely agree. And this report agrees that a big part
*  of the federal government's role in a warming world is to help people, particularly poor
*  people adapt to climate change. But the report's all about making that adaptation less expensive.
*  There are smarter ways, the report says, to do all this. And there are ways the government
*  can help people make smarter decisions on their own. But there's a problem with helping
*  people make smarter decisions. It often means telling people things they don't want to hear.
*  So Jim, how does this report from the White House propose getting people to make smarter
*  decisions and get the government out of its own way on climate, given the specific policy
*  that we have been talking about so far?
*  Well, there's basically two very broad ways that the report talks about that. The first
*  is you can help people make better decisions by giving them better information about the
*  decisions they're making. So if we don't really know what the risks are from climate change,
*  it's hard for us as consumers to know what to buy or where to live or what to plant.
*  And so the report suggests the government do more to actually quantify and specify what
*  those risks are. But the second thing, and the much bigger, more overarching part of
*  the report is the government needs to stop paying you to make what the government already
*  believes are very risky decisions. And that is the big change it's proposing, sweeping
*  changes to all sorts of government programs to pull some of that perverse incentive back.
*  How does that actually work in practice, making people stop making bad decisions?
*  Well, let's go back to some of those examples we were talking about earlier. Like, take
*  forest fires. The report sort of posits maybe the Forest Service needs to do less wildland
*  firefighting. Maybe you should just let some places burn is the implication because they're
*  too risky.
*  I mean, that would be a very big change. And it might mean telling somebody that their
*  house is going to burn down.
*  Right, right. Which nobody wants to hear that the government might let your house burn
*  down. But that would be the implication of letting people bear that risk more on their
*  own.
*  Okay, how else can the government change these incentives?
*  So I think another really big one, and it's contained in this kind of fun, shaded box
*  within the report, almost like a nerd Easter egg in the report, is about insurance markets.
*  Because sometimes the perverse incentive from the government is that insurers see the risks
*  of people living in certain areas, and they just won't insure them anymore. And the government
*  ends up footing the bill.
*  So what the report envisions is completely rethinking how insurance works so that it's
*  not the government stepping in with a big check at the end, but that actually we're
*  spreading the costs over an efficient market over time. Now, here's how that would work.
*  Right now you buy fire insurance or hurricane insurance or flood insurance, like as a separate
*  one off policy, the report envisions and I guess they do this in some countries like
*  France and New Zealand, the big national multi peril disaster insurance, basically just like
*  everything in one policy. And everybody has to buy it, everybody pays into it, and then
*  spreads the risk. When disasters strike, that fund pays out, you know, the benefits. So
*  you're essentially creating a much broader risk pool and keeping the government from
*  having to pay these huge costs that again, could be perversely incentivizing people because
*  they know the government's going to step in if bad things happen.
*  Right. So this might not exactly stop people from having a house or building house in the
*  wrong place, but it's going to prevent the federal government from footing the bill when
*  the cost of that decision comes due.
*  Right. The idea is that the people in those areas will have at least some more skin in
*  the game because they'll be buying insurance of some kind, even if a private insurer has
*  pulled out of their market.
*  And what about the crop insurance subsidies that you had mentioned? What does this report
*  suggest doing differently when it comes to something like that?
*  Well, the obvious implication from the report is the government should subsidize crop insurance
*  less in particular for highly climate change exposed crops. And if you reduce the subsidy,
*  there will be less of that planting.
*  So so far, the solutions seem kind of obvious, which is if a government policy has perverse
*  incentives, do less of that perverse incentivizing.
*  Yes, that's what a lot of this policy is. But the report goes beyond that. And I think
*  this is a fascinating part of it. It talks about the federal government trying to use
*  its muscle to try to change some of the incentives that cities and states have right now that
*  leads them to allow building in risky places.
*  Okay, explain that. What are the local incentives?
*  Well, there's a lot. So right now, if your community on the coast or in the mountains
*  and you green light more building that is businesses or homes and that brings in property
*  taxes, well, the local government reaps the values of that. But overall, that building
*  might be really risky for the country. And if fires rip through those new homes, the
*  federal government ends up often paying the costs of the disaster relief.
*  Right.
*  What the report suggests is, hey, let's condition federal dollars more on states and cities
*  making better decisions. We're going to give money to the places that don't build on flood
*  plains that don't build in fire zones that are more careful about what and where they
*  build.
*  Interesting. So in other words, the federal government knows that it can't tell a coastal
*  community you can't build houses there, even though ultimately, the federal government
*  is going to bear a huge amount of the cost of bailing out that community in a flood.
*  But what it can do is say to the entire state, hey, you want something from us, then you
*  need to behave differently. And that might trickle down to that coastal community and
*  affect decision making there.
*  Right. Listen, we've got lots of money for infrastructure. Perhaps you say even more
*  so than the government already is. We're not going to rebuild your bridge that keeps getting
*  washed out by floods. We're going to rebuild a bridge if you choose to build in a safer
*  place. Or we're not going to put broadband internet into that new subdivision in a really
*  high fire risk zone. So a lot of the things we've already talked about are the federal
*  government removing incentives. This is the federal government exerting pressure. It's
*  using the power of its dollars to make city and state leaders feel like we need to rethink
*  how we are developing our communities if we want to be eligible for this federal funding.
*  Got it. Doesn't that mean, Jim, if we're being honest, that many Republican controlled
*  communities and states whose leaders are openly skeptical of climate change are going to be
*  a lot less likely to therefore receive federal spending given the strings that would be attached
*  to it and more likely to be kind of punished under this kind of a system?
*  That's a complicated question. And I think there's two answers to it. The first is the
*  report does note that places where people believe strongly in the science of climate
*  change tend to be better at adaptation and take less risk in the face of climate change.
*  So in that sense, they'll be less hard hit. But in a second sense, a lot of liberals live
*  in the mountains and on the coasts. And often you see communities there really fighting
*  any idea that the government's going to tell them they can't have that second home or they
*  can't be where they want to be. Republicans certainly don't like the government telling
*  them what to do. But a lot of Democrats don't either. And I think that's one of the real
*  political challenges for any climate adaptation strategy is the government is going to explicitly
*  or implicitly be telling people a lot of ways that they currently behave don't work anymore.
*  So the politics of this, you're saying are much more nuanced and complicated than they
*  might seem. Absolutely. Take my home state of Oregon, which is a fairly liberal state
*  where people really believe in general in the science of climate change. But when the
*  state tried last year to publish a map showing fire risk for homeowners, Oregonians just
*  recoiled. There was a huge outcry. People were complaining that it was going to drive
*  up their insurance costs and it was going to drive down their property values. And the
*  state had to withdraw the map and then go back to the drawing board on a new process
*  for it this year. And I think that just sort of shows just how difficult this is going
*  to be trying to get people to adapt to the risks of a changing climate, because people
*  want to live in their homes. They don't want to be told that the existing world they live
*  in is suddenly more expensive or less valuable. Right. What's interesting about that example,
*  Jim, is that first of all, it's pretty modest, right? Just publishing a map that says you're
*  at greater risk if you live here. But it's also exactly what this report suggests the
*  federal government needs to do. Just tell people the truth, give them lots of data about
*  where their risks are greatest, and then follow up with carrots and sticks that either reward
*  or punish communities based on whether or not they're adapting to climate change. That's
*  exactly why this is so hard. If just publishing a map that just shows fire risk is this difficult.
*  Imagine how hard it's going to be when the federal government comes along and says, hey,
*  we're not going to give you that grant because you just greenlit a subdivision that we think
*  is going to flood in 10 years. I mean, it's just generally true in American politics,
*  probably just politics, that it's easier to give people carrots. Hey, I'm going to incentivize
*  you to do something that we think is right than to punish them for doing something you
*  think is wrong. Actually, we know this from the administration's approach to climate change
*  in a variety of other ways. They're subsidizing people buying electric vehicles because they
*  think that's good. They've chosen that path as opposed to making it more expensive to
*  buy gasoline by putting on a carbon tax. What's really interesting in this report is it envisions
*  a world where you're pulling away subsidies, where you are changing risk behavior in part
*  by a lot more punitive measures. Right. It's very clear that should this approach ever
*  be adopted by the federal government, because right now it's all very theoretical, there
*  would be a ton of resistance. So how likely is it, Jim, that what we're discussing, what
*  this report envisions will ever become reality, that the Forest Service might not fight fires
*  that would save a house and that the government might withhold money to a community for a
*  bridge if that state doesn't get its climate act together? How realistic is that?
*  I think the political pressure against these sort of government changes to adapt to climate
*  change is going to be really high. It's going to be hard for any future administration or
*  this current one to start implementing a bunch of these things. But I also think that adapting
*  to climate change is going to be hard. And that is sort of the real tension driving the
*  economics in this report. You're probably not going to have a choice in a lot of these
*  communities of just sticking with the life you had before the world started warming.
*  You're going to be dealing with more forest fires. You're going to be dealing with more
*  sea level rise. You're going to be dealing with more flooding and natural disaster. And
*  the only question is who pays for that?
*  What we are seeing from this report, what we see from all of the climate warnings we're
*  getting now is that it's becoming more immediate. This is not some abstract concept where we
*  have a binary choice of, oh, do we want to deal with it or not? You have to deal with
*  it. It's like paying your taxes. You can put it off as long as you want, but at some point
*  you have to sit down and deal with it one way or another. And I think what this report
*  is trying to do is kind of make clear that there are less expensive or more expensive
*  ways to actually deal with it and hopefully steer people to the less painful, less expensive
*  ways.
*  Right. You're saying we have to add something to that list of death and taxes, death and
*  taxes and the bill for climate change. Those are the things that we have to deal with.
*  Death, taxes, adapting to the horrible realities of a warming world. Yes, exactly, Michael.
*  Jim, thank you very much.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values, values for freedom, human rights and
*  innovation.
*  During a five hour congressional hearing on Thursday, lawmakers from both parties berated
*  the chief executive of TikTok, claiming frequently without evidence that the hugely popular platform
*  is a tool of the Chinese government.
*  TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance and more manipulation.
*  Your platform should be banned.
*  TikTok is owned by a company based in China.
*  But in his testimony, its CEO, Shouchu, told lawmakers that TikTok is an independent company
*  that is not influenced by China.
*  And he assured them that the company has carefully protected the data of its American users from
*  any foreign interference by making sure that that data never leaves the United States.
*  That's what we've been doing for the last two years, building what amounts to a firewall
*  that seals off protected US user data from unauthorized foreign access.
*  The bottom line is this, American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen
*  by American personnel.
