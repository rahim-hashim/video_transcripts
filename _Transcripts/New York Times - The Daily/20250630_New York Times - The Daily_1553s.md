# Supreme Court Hands Trump Even More Power | The Daily
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48)
*  Well, this was a big one, wasn't it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=0.0s)]
*  This was a big decision. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=4.4s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=6.12s)]
*  This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=9.6s)]
*  the separation of powers, and the rule of law. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=15.8s)]
*  In a major ruling on Friday, the Supreme Court limited the ability of judges to block President [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=19.68s)]
*  Trump's policies nationwide, including his order to end birthright citizenship. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=25.04s)]
*  I'm grateful to the Supreme Court for stepping in and solving this very, very big and complex [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=30.16s)]
*  problem and they've made it very simple. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=37.16s)]
*  The ruling was immediately cheered by the president. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=39.28s)]
*  It is a big blow to our ability to enforce our rights. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  While critics have decried it as a fundamental threat to the rule of law. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  This is just chaos that they've unleashed in the judicial system for no reason at all. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=50.18s)]
*  That kind of ruling establishes not just an imperial executive, but an imperial Supreme Court. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=55.46s)]
*  Today, my colleague Adam Liptaek explains how the ruling redefines the role of the courts [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=62.34s)]
*  at a moment when the White House is aggressively testing the limits of its power. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=68.86s)]
*  It's Monday, June 30th. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  Adam, we're talking to you just a couple days after the ruling by the Supreme Court in this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=80.18s)]
*  birthright citizenship case. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=88.5s)]
*  The ruling has pretty big implications, not just for the case, but really for the role [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  of the courts and also for a presidency that has been testing the limits of its power and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  of the law since President Trump took office back in January. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=100.54s)]
*  Yeah, the decision has a lot of moving pieces, Rachel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  As you say, it's nominally about birthright citizenship, but really it's about the power [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=107.26s)]
*  of the courts to check the president. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=113.62s)]
*  And the court gave President Trump a big victory. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=117.54s)]
*  It severely limited the ability of lower court judges to stop him from pursuing his ambitious [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=122.54s)]
*  agenda. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=130.82s)]
*  Can you just remind us, what are the basics of the case and how did the court arrive at [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=131.82s)]
*  the decision that it did? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=136.78s)]
*  So on assuming office, President Trump issued an executive order purporting to put an end [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  to birthright citizenship, a fundamental constitutional value in the 14th Amendment that says if you're [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=143.98s)]
*  born in the United States, you're a United States citizen. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=150.33999999999997s)]
*  And that's a very bold thing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  It was promptly challenged and three different federal judges in Maryland, in Massachusetts, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=156.06s)]
*  in Washington state, issued preliminary injunctions blocking the executive order. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=160.74s)]
*  And the case makes its way to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=166.82000000000002s)]
*  The lawyer for the Trump administration does something odd. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  He says, I'm not challenging in the Supreme Court the constitutionality or not of birthright [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  citizenship, but I think these lower court judges did something wrong. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=181.94s)]
*  They issued what people called nationwide injunctions, sometimes called universal injunctions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=186.82s)]
*  And just remind people what that means exactly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=193.54s)]
*  A universal injunction goes beyond the parties to the case. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=195.66s)]
*  It says, I'm a judge, I rule in your favor, and because you're right that this government [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=199.66s)]
*  policy is unconstitutional, I'm going to give relief not only to you, but to everybody else [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=206.62s)]
*  affected by the policy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=213.34s)]
*  And that is a fairly recent development that there should be such broad injunctions. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=217.85999999999999s)]
*  Let's remember, Rachel, this is not the only executive order that courts have found unlawful. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=226.3s)]
*  There have been more than 25 universal injunctions on the president's efforts to shut down agencies, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=232.82s)]
*  to cut funding, to fire federal workers, to bar transgender service members, to deport [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=239.9s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=249.66s)]
*  This is a major, major clash between this administration and lots and lots of federal [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=252.1s)]
*  trial court judges. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=260.46s)]
*  And as you said, the White House came to the Supreme Court not asking them to rule on whether [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=262.46s)]
*  the executive order on birthright citizenship was constitutional, which I suspect they think [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=266.24s)]
*  they don't really have a good shot of prevailing it anyway. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=270.88s)]
*  Instead, the government is coming to the Supreme Court with the intent of going after these [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  nationwide injunctions. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=279.24s)]
*  Yeah, the consensus view of legal experts is that the administration's arguments on birthright [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=280.72s)]
*  citizenship as such are quite weak. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=288.08s)]
*  So they thought, what the hell, we will do what many other cases have done, ask the court [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=291.18s)]
*  to decide whether nationwide injunctions are proper. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=297.18s)]
*  No presidents like nationwide injunctions. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=301.08s)]
*  The Biden administration didn't like them. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=303.3s)]
*  The Trump administration didn't like them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=305.38s)]
*  And this was, I don't know, the third, the fourth time they've asked the court to hear [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=307.66s)]
*  the issue. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=311.54s)]
*  And it was a surprise when they did, because it doesn't seem like the perfect vehicle to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=313.06s)]
*  decide the question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=317.86s)]
*  This case has a lot of complications. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=319.06s)]
*  And yet the court nevertheless issued this major ruling giving President Trump and other [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=322.54s)]
*  presidents a lot of power to do stuff unchecked by the lower courts. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=327.54s)]
*  And so basically this ruling makes it so that all those other cases you just mentioned where [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=332.38s)]
*  judges issued universal injunctions that apply to the whole country, all of that could be [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=336.1s)]
*  moot. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=340.62s)]
*  The Supreme Court is basically taking a huge power away from the lower courts. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=341.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=345.3s)]
*  Adam, I want to understand the ruling a little bit more. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=346.38s)]
*  And specifically, can you help us understand the majority's legal reasoning here? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=348.58s)]
*  How did they explain why these nationwide injunctions were so problematic? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=353.18s)]
*  The majority opinion is written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=357.56s)]
*  It's the biggest decision of her career. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=361.62s)]
*  It's quite a surprising assignment for such a junior justice to get. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=363.74s)]
*  She writes for the six justice conservative majority, all of the Republican appointees. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=367.62s)]
*  All three of the Democratic appointees are in dissent. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=373.9s)]
*  And her argument is kind of a classic originalist take on the question. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  She says that when Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, it gave courts some powers, but [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=383.58s)]
*  it didn't give them this power. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  And it looked back at English law. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=393.78s)]
*  And basically, it was what conservatives often go to, which is tradition and history, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=396.98s)]
*  and less what's the better way to address an executive who is claiming huge powers. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=404.54s)]
*  So let me read you a couple of snippets from the decision. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=411.14000000000004s)]
*  Please. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=413.70000000000005s)]
*  Justice Barrett writes, universal injunctions were not a feature of federal court litigation [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=414.70000000000005s)]
*  until sometime in the 20th century. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=420.38s)]
*  She goes on to say they remained rare until the turn of the 21st century, and that one [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=423.88s)]
*  study has identified approximately 127 universal injunctions between 1963 and 2023. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=429.68s)]
*  But 96 of those, over three quarters, were issued during the administrations of George [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=439.94s)]
*  W. Bush, Barack Obama, President Trump, and President Biden. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=445.6s)]
*  So she makes the case that this is a recent concoction and therefore under originalist [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=451.26s)]
*  thinking quite suspect. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=456.5s)]
*  So focusing on history, she says, the bottom line, question mark, the universal injunction [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=458.7s)]
*  was conspicuously nonexistent for most of our nation's history. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=464.24s)]
*  Had federal courts believed themselves to possess the tool, surely they would not have [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=469.78s)]
*  let it lay idle. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=473.48s)]
*  So basically, Justice Barrett is saying, look, I've looked into the history of what our system [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=474.86s)]
*  from the start envisioned as the power of the federal courts, and it is not a system [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=479.24s)]
*  in which a single district judge can block the actions of the president for everybody [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=483.96000000000004s)]
*  in the country. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=487.94s)]
*  Like, that's just way too sweeping a power to give one particular judge. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=488.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=492.44s)]
*  So she's arguing that the two dozen or so universal injunctions issued since Trump took [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=493.44s)]
*  time are a vast overreach by federal judges who are claiming a power they do not possess. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=503.54s)]
*  Does she have a point here? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=511.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, what you've just outlined does make some sense to me on paper. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=517.4s)]
*  Lots of people think there are good reasons to be wary of universal injunctions. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=518.98s)]
*  Another way to think about it is someone should decide whether these programs are lawful, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=524.48s)]
*  but maybe that should be the Supreme Court and not a judge who may have been cherry-picked [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=531.8s)]
*  by the litigants. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=537.12s)]
*  On the other side of the balance is we have a president here who is issuing a really aggressive [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=538.4s)]
*  set of initiatives that will upend the way the nation works and that many people would [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=545.4s)]
*  say needs a prompt judicial reaction and needs to be paused while cases go forward. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  Otherwise the executive orders could be irreversible. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=561.6s)]
*  The idea here being, in other words, that this president, as we've mentioned, has been [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=566.28s)]
*  testing the boundaries of the law so frequently and in so many ways that you need the tool [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  of universal injunctions. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=574.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  And remember, too, these are provisional rulings. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  These just freeze the status quo while the case goes ahead and the merits will be decided [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=581.36s)]
*  eventually. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=586.84s)]
*  And the question is, if Donald Trump wakes up one morning and issues an executive order, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=588.08s)]
*  does that presumptively stay in place for a couple of years while the case winds its [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=593.44s)]
*  way through the courts? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=598.96s)]
*  Or can a federal judge have an early look and say, you know what, I don't think this [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=600.6s)]
*  is lawful and I'm going to give it due consideration, but in the meantime, I'm going to freeze the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=605.64s)]
*  status quo? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what I have a question about because let's say he does issue an executive [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  If this tool of universal injunctions is not available, what, if anything, does Barrett [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=616.36s)]
*  and the rest of the majority say could take its place during the whole process of figuring [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=621.76s)]
*  out whether something is legal? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  Justice Barrett did say there were a few alternative routes to get to something like the same place. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=628.6s)]
*  And the main one she focused on was class actions. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=635.72s)]
*  A class action is a kind of case where a few named plaintiffs represent a whole class [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=638.92s)]
*  of people. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=646.2s)]
*  And if they win, all of those people get the benefits of the court's ruling. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=647.96s)]
*  And that kind of approach nobody disputes is lawful. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=653.56s)]
*  Now, class actions are cumbersome. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=658.96s)]
*  The Supreme Court has been trying to cut back on them. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=661.46s)]
*  But that is the primary vehicle that Justice Barrett suggests could be an alternative to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=665.44s)]
*  universal injunctions. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=671.72s)]
*  So what does this ruling mean altogether for the executive order to end birthright citizenship? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=673.72s)]
*  Well, there's an interesting wrinkle. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=678.6s)]
*  The court says its ruling will not go into effect for 30 days. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=681.28s)]
*  And that means that challengers are going to scramble on at least a couple different [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=686.52s)]
*  levels. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=692.24s)]
*  We've already had two class actions filed on Friday, the same day the decision came [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=694.36s)]
*  down. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=698.2s)]
*  There's a decent chance that one or more courts, again, shut the thing down across the nation. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=699.5600000000001s)]
*  But if that doesn't happen, we're going to end up in a weird, curious world. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=708.0600000000001s)]
*  22 states challenged the birthright citizenship order, and they won. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=713.04s)]
*  And those victories remain in place. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  So if at the end of 30 days we don't have any movement, we'll have a patchwork with [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=720.48s)]
*  20-plus states having a system where children born there are citizens, and in the rest [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=726.52s)]
*  of the country not. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=733.28s)]
*  Okay, but just to be clear, this whole issue of the patchwork system could be totally moot [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=734.28s)]
*  in the short term and in the long term, right? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=740.36s)]
*  Because theoretically, some case could wind its way up to the Supreme Court that is directly [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=742.48s)]
*  about birthright citizenship and whether it is constitutional. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=747.84s)]
*  And as you've said, it seems likely that the Supreme Court would rule in favor of keeping [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=751.82s)]
*  birthright citizenship and against the president's executive order. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=756.1800000000001s)]
*  So in that instance, this whole birthright citizenship issue, that just gets put to rest. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=759.84s)]
*  Everything reverts to the way it was for 160 years. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=765.6s)]
*  However, the issue of overturning nationwide injunctions would remain. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=769.2800000000001s)]
*  And that brings us back to the point at the beginning of the conversation that this case [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=773.54s)]
*  is about something much bigger than just whether you are a citizen if you were born here. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=778.0999999999999s)]
*  Do I have that right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=783.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=784.54s)]
*  I mean, this case arises against the backdrop of a president who is pushing the most aggressive [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=785.54s)]
*  program in living memory, perhaps in American history, testing the boundaries of the law. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=793.0999999999999s)]
*  And the three dissenting justices wrote scathing dissents in which they said the majority had [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=800.58s)]
*  taken a profound wrong turn in formal historical analysis at the expense of the reality of [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=807.6600000000001s)]
*  withdrawing the main tool that judges have used to keep this very aggressive administration [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=816.5400000000001s)]
*  in check. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=824.0600000000001s)]
*  I've heard a lot of dissents in my day. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=825.06s)]
*  And these dissents from the three Democratic appointees were really harsh and really thought [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=831.3399999999999s)]
*  that democracy was in peril. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=838.3399999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=848.5s)]
*  Adam, as you mentioned earlier, the ruling was 6-3 with the court's three liberal justices [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=851.5s)]
*  dissenting, pretty ferociously, actually. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=859.34s)]
*  Can you explain the response and why it was as strong as it was? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=861.1s)]
*  Well, the main dissent was written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=864.86s)]
*  Kagan and Katanji Brown Jackson. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=869.94s)]
*  And Justice Sotomayor did something that justices very seldom do. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=872.98s)]
*  She read major portions of her dissent from the bench, which is a sign of profound disagreement. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=876.96s)]
*  She thought the court had gone badly astray. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=884.26s)]
*  Let me just give you a taste of her opinion, Rachel. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=888.0s)]
*  She says, no right is safe in the new legal regime the court creates. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  Today the threat is to birthright citizenship. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=897.76s)]
*  Tomorrow a different administration may try to seize firearms from law abiding citizens [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=900.0400000000001s)]
*  or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=905.28s)]
*  The majority holds that, absent cumbersome class action litigation, courts cannot enjoin [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=908.9599999999999s)]
*  even such plainly unlawful policies. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=915.98s)]
*  So she sees a very broad threat to all kinds of freedoms and not only freedoms that conservatives [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=919.4s)]
*  like or liberals like, but to the very texture and nature of the American experience. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  So Sotomayor clearly not satisfied with the alternatives, including class actions, that [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=930.68s)]
*  Barrett and the conservative justices have suggested here. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=936.0999999999999s)]
*  And she also sees this as setting up a terrible precedent that could be taken advantage of [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=939.2199999999999s)]
*  by future administrations. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=942.7199999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=945.0799999999999s)]
*  But Justice Sotomayor is meeting Justice Barrett on the legal arguments. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=946.18s)]
*  A separate dissent, maybe an even hotter dissent, comes from Justice Katanji Brown Jackson writing [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=952.16s)]
*  only for herself. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=958.98s)]
*  And she says the majority's decision lets the executive branch violate the Constitution [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=960.9000000000001s)]
*  with respect to anyone who hasn't sued, anyone who's not a party. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=966.7800000000001s)]
*  And she says that's quote, an existential threat to the rule of law. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=971.46s)]
*  Justice Jackson makes the point that the majority creates kind of a two tiered system. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=976.2600000000001s)]
*  There are people with money and lawyers and the wherewithal to go to court and get relief. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=981.3000000000001s)]
*  But a lot of people don't have that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=988.04s)]
*  And she says that's a real flaw in the court's reasoning as well. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=990.2199999999999s)]
*  So it sounds like Jackson is basically saying we're in a new legal world here with this [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=993.16s)]
*  ruling. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=997.64s)]
*  Lots of Americans will have their rights violated by the president. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=998.92s)]
*  And the only way that they can fight it is if they sue the government, which most people [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1001.98s)]
*  just do not have the time or the resources to do. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1005.56s)]
*  And they're going to be forced to do that because these injunctions are no longer here [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1008.64s)]
*  to protect us against executive branch overreach. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1012.5999999999999s)]
*  And so effectively with this ruling, all of a sudden, all of us here in the United [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1015.76s)]
*  States would have to become legal combatants essentially to protect basic rights enshrined [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1020.72s)]
*  in the Constitution. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1026.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, her language is just this side of apocalyptic. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1027.36s)]
*  She says the majority's complicity in the creation of a culture of disdain for lower [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1032.08s)]
*  courts, their rulings and the law will surely hasten the downfall of our governing institutions, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1037.0s)]
*  enabling our collective demise. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  So clearly she's not mincing her words. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1047.72s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1050.24s)]
*  And Justice Barrett did not appreciate that commentary. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1051.24s)]
*  And here we saw really a quite unusual thing where the two most junior members of the court [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1054.84s)]
*  were really going at each other and in tones that were quite remarkable. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1060.8999999999999s)]
*  Barrett, writing for the majority, says, we will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1067.3999999999999s)]
*  which is at odds with more than two centuries worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1074.28s)]
*  itself. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1079.16s)]
*  We observe only this. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1080.56s)]
*  Justice Jackson decries an imperial executive while embracing an imperial judiciary. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1082.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  Can you just translate that for us, Adam? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1089.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1091.52s)]
*  Barrett is saying that the majority ruling is modest. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1092.52s)]
*  It wants to stop judges from being activists. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1096.2s)]
*  It wants to keep everyone in their own lanes. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1099.36s)]
*  And according to her, Justice Jackson wants judges to decide everything, even things that [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1102.36s)]
*  ought to be decided by the elected branches. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1107.78s)]
*  Like she's basically saying, Justice Jackson doesn't want an imperious president, but she's [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  perfectly happy with judges overreaching. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1114.6s)]
*  That's her view. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1117.4399999999998s)]
*  But they're operating on two different levels. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1119.02s)]
*  One side is saying, and you can find this persuasive or not, but Justice Barrett is [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1121.52s)]
*  saying, you look at the legal materials, you look at history, you look at tradition, you [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1125.3999999999999s)]
*  look at the governing statute, and you come to a conclusion. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1129.92s)]
*  And Justice Jackson is saying, the conclusion you have led us to is one in which the president [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  of the United States can largely do whatever he wants. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1140.3600000000001s)]
*  Basically, you guys are minding the details, but you're ignoring the practical realities [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1144.16s)]
*  of your decision. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1147.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1148.96s)]
*  But Justice Barrett feels that the upshot of Justice Jackson's dissent is actually to [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1149.96s)]
*  give too much power to the federal courts. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1156.2s)]
*  And Barrett quotes Justice Jackson's own words against her. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1159.56s)]
*  Barrett says, Justice Jackson would do well to heed her own admonition, and then quoting [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1164.36s)]
*  from Jackson, everyone from the president on down is bound by law. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1169.6s)]
*  The suggestion being that the dissenters also need to follow the law. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1175.32s)]
*  Wow, it really sounds like Barrett is basically throwing Jackson's words back in her face. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1178.52s)]
*  Is it usually this pointed and personal? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1183.2s)]
*  Well, back in the day before Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016, he could write a biting [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1187.4s)]
*  sentence. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1193.04s)]
*  But even then, there was an element of playfulness and humor to it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1194.04s)]
*  This seemed quite raw. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1199.72s)]
*  It kind of feels like in this back and forth between Jackson and Barrett, that this is [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1201.6000000000001s)]
*  actually fundamentally about the power of the president versus the power of the courts [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1206.0800000000002s)]
*  and the balance between the two of them. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  That's right, Rachel, although I would draw a distinction. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1212.44s)]
*  It is true that the majority amplifies executive power, presidential power, the power of President [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1215.28s)]
*  Trump. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1221.92s)]
*  And it's true that the dissent wants federal trial judges to be able to judge the lawfulness [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1222.92s)]
*  of Trump programs. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1230.2s)]
*  But the place I might draw a slightly different distinction is, I don't think the Supreme [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1232.52s)]
*  Court is eager to give up any of its own power, while it doesn't think that lower court judges [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1238.06s)]
*  get to have the last word vis-a-vis the president. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1243.84s)]
*  It at least wants to reserve for itself the right to do that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1247.04s)]
*  But at the same time, this is a court for the second term in a row on the last day of [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1251.56s)]
*  the term by a 6-3 vote, manages to profoundly amplify presidential power. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1257.0s)]
*  Last year, they ruled in favor of then presidential candidate Trump on the question of whether [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1265.2s)]
*  he was largely immune from prosecution. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1271.1799999999998s)]
*  And in the process, sketched out a vision of a bold and energetic president unchecked [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1274.3s)]
*  by law in many realms. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1280.8999999999999s)]
*  And this year, it kind of vindicates and even further amplifies that vision of the presidency [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1283.54s)]
*  by saying that judges around the country can't tell the president what to do. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1290.1799999999998s)]
*  And in both of the cases, the majority says, we are talking about the nature of executive [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1295.82s)]
*  power. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1300.7s)]
*  It applies to all presidents. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1301.7s)]
*  It's not about any particular president. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1303.74s)]
*  But at least in the short term, it has profoundly helped President Trump. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1306.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1311.02s)]
*  It seems not unreasonable to say that it's difficult to divorce the two. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1312.02s)]
*  Given this new understanding of presidential versus judicial power, if you are President [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1316.8600000000001s)]
*  Trump, what becomes possible now that this ruling has been issued that perhaps was not [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1321.54s)]
*  possible before? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1326.38s)]
*  Well, for starters, he faces a couple dozen universal injunctions. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1328.06s)]
*  And I think he might well be able to go to court and get some or all of them dissolved. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1333.8999999999999s)]
*  On issues just to be clear, like firing federal workers, defunding federal agencies that you [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1338.22s)]
*  talked about earlier. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1343.3s)]
*  That's right. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1344.3s)]
*  Adam, do you think that there's any chance that the government's goal all along with [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1345.3s)]
*  this birthright citizenship executive order and the obvious challenges that were going [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1350.9399999999998s)]
*  to come to it? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1355.62s)]
*  Do you think that they intended from the beginning that this was going to be something that would [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1356.62s)]
*  ultimately help them not end birthright citizenship, but expand executive power the way that you [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1360.9399999999998s)]
*  have just explained? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1366.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1367.7399999999998s)]
*  Well, whether this was strategic brilliance or happenstance, what transpired was that [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1368.7399999999998s)]
*  the administration gained one of its most dearly sought goals, which is not to let judges [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1373.7399999999998s)]
*  block its initiatives and programs and judge the lawfulness of the Trump agenda. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1381.8999999999999s)]
*  Now, the immediate consequence of the court's ruling might be a lot more litigation because [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1388.22s)]
*  it may be that a lot of individuals are going to feel they need to have to sue because they [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1394.3799999999999s)]
*  don't have the benefit of universal injunctions. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1399.02s)]
*  But the big picture is we have a president who's quite happy with the Supreme Court. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1403.58s)]
*  So we see a kind of close relationship, a dynamic relationship between the president [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1409.98s)]
*  and the Supreme Court with the president claiming unprecedented powers for himself and the court [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1417.3s)]
*  not only not standing in his way, but generally opening the door. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1424.66s)]
*  Adam, thank you for spending part of your weekend with us. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1429.5s)]
*  It's good to be here, Rachel. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1434.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1436.06s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1439.98s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1457.42s)]
*  On Sunday, the Senate started debate on President Trump's domestic policy package. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1459.66s)]
*  It's not clear if GOP leaders have enough support to pass the measure by their deadline of July 4th. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1464.54s)]
*  Although many Republicans hailed the tax cuts and reductions to Medicaid and other social programs, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1470.46s)]
*  Democrats universally assailed the bill, which a new analysis says would add at least $3.3 trillion [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1475.34s)]
*  to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1481.74s)]
*  And Republican Senator Tom Tillis of North Carolina says he will not seek reelection next year, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1487.74s)]
*  in part because of his opposition to the bill. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1493.58s)]
*  His announcement came a day after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenger against [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1496.22s)]
*  him because Tillis would not fall in line. His departure is sure to set off a competitive race [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1500.3s)]
*  in North Carolina that could be pivotal in the battle for control of the Senate. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1506.22s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Diana Nguyen, Rachelle Banja, and Rob Zipko. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1515.5s)]
*  It was edited by Patricia Willans and Rachel Quester. It contains original music by Alicia [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmlXSyO0K48&t=1520.1399999999999s)]
