# The State of the Union
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CethFEJyN_c)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  On Thursday night, President Biden used the final State of the Union address of his first
*  term to make his case for a second term and to prosecute his case against Donald Trump.
*  Today, my colleague, White House reporter Jim Tankersley, walks us through the biggest
*  moments of the speech.
*  It's Friday, March 8th.
*  So Jim, good evening and thank you for staying up with us for what I have always thought
*  of as the Super Bowl for nerds in Washington, the State of the Union.
*  Absolutely.
*  Although the Super Bowl starts about three hours earlier.
*  So it's in some ways a little easier.
*  And ends roughly around the same time.
*  Right, roughly around the same time.
*  And has commercials, kind of fun commercials, which we didn't get here.
*  No, no.
*  So it's kind of impossible to separate this State of the Union from the moment in which
*  it's being delivered, which is the start of a general election campaign for president
*  that has started so much faster than I think anyone had expected.
*  In this case, the speech comes just a day after Donald Trump's last rival drops out
*  of the race.
*  The Republican primary is now over and the race for the White House is officially whittled
*  down now to Trump versus Biden.
*  And it's at this moment that President Biden delivers this State of the Union.
*  So with all that in mind, what, heading into this night, Jim, do we understand to be Biden's
*  mission with this speech?
*  The timing makes this speech extraordinary, sort of historically.
*  I think we can overemphasize the importance of State of the Union speeches sometimes.
*  But not this one.
*  This is definitely one of the most important speeches Joe Biden has given as president,
*  if not the most important thus far.
*  It's important because he's not winning this race.
*  The polls do not show him beating Donald Trump right now.
*  And it shows massive headwinds facing his reelection campaign.
*  Voters do not approve of the job he's doing as president.
*  They think he is too old and they do not buy what he is selling on his policy record right now.
*  So Biden comes into this speech wanting to reset all of those.
*  These are his goals.
*  He wants to tell some new stories about policy, about the economy, about abortion, about foreign
*  policy that make him look a lot better.
*  He wants to draw contrasts with Trump that make Biden look more likeable and more preferable
*  to Trump than voters had been thinking coming into the speech.
*  And maybe most importantly, he wants to dispel or at least quiet these concerns about his
*  age by showing himself to be sort of a vigorous Joe Biden who's up for the job.
*  OK, with all that in mind, walk us through the speech itself and how Biden sought to
*  navigate all of these issues and challenges he faces.
*  It's a really interesting start.
*  Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.
*  He kicks off with a joke.
*  He hears all the applause and says, Good evening.
*  If I were smart, I'd go home now.
*  And then from that moment of levity, he pivots quickly into a very serious section when he
*  lays out threats to democracy and freedom abroad and at home.
*  Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe
*  and beyond.
*  He starts with the war in Ukraine and with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he talks
*  about him and compares him basically to Hitler on the march in Europe.
*  If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not.
*  And casts America and the Biden presidency as crucial to stopping this march.
*  And then he tosses in what will be a real sign of what's to come, which is his first
*  swipe at Donald Trump.
*  Now my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, quote, do whatever the hell you
*  want.
*  That's a quote.
*  He quotes him and accuses him of bowing down to Putin.
*  I think it's outrageous, it's dangerous and it's unacceptable.
*  From Russia, Biden jumps to the United States and he's continuing to build sort of this
*  case against Trump.
*  History is watching.
*  Just like history watched three years ago on January 6th.
*  Now he starts talking about the January 6th riots at the Capitol.
*  Many of you are here on that darkest of days.
*  We all saw with our own eyes the insurrections were not patriots.
*  They come to stop the peaceful transfer of power to oversterne the will of the people.
*  He calls it the greatest threat to US democracy since the Civil War.
*  This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies.
*  And he says that Trump tried to bury the truth.
*  You can't love your country only when you win.
*  The subtext here is hard to mess.
*  Biden is saying Trump is a threat to democracy in Europe and to democracy in the United States.
*  Right.
*  And it becomes clear on this moment that this is going to be a State of the Union that has
*  a lot to do with Donald Trump.
*  Yeah, Donald Trump is like the unnamed main character in this speech.
*  When you talk to Biden aides and his allies, they are all a little bit or a lot mystified
*  at what they see as Americans sort of almost amnesia about Trump, not just sort of the
*  chaos of the years that Trump was president, but also the effects of his policies.
*  They think people are sort of remembering him overly nostalgically in a way that Biden
*  clearly sets out in this speech to try to change.
*  And the next way he does that after this riff about democracy is by talking about abortion
*  and reproductive freedom.
*  As most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right.
*  He talks about how Roe v. Wade, in Biden's view, was correctly decided, but a Supreme
*  Court with justices appointed by Trump overturned it, which he knows Americans in the polling
*  largely do not like.
*  He's the reason it was overturned and he brags about it.
*  Look at the chaos that has resulted.
*  And then he talks about that leading to further erosion of reproductive freedoms, including
*  the recent Alabama decision about IVF.
*  Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive
*  freedom.
*  My God, what freedom else would you take away?
*  And there is this sort of extraordinary moment where he turns to the members of the Supreme
*  Court who are there at the speech.
*  It's not all of them, but it's several of them, and tells them.
*  With all due respect, justices, women are not without electoral power, excuse me, electoral
*  or political power.
*  You're about to realize just how much you've overrided.
*  Basically, hey, you're underestimating women.
*  You're underestimating what you have wrought with your decision striking down Roe.
*  Right.
*  And it's actually in this moment of him speaking to the justices that he becomes his most overtly
*  kind of campain-y.
*  He actually says that in 2024, women will show their power.
*  And in that moment, I certainly felt like this was going to be not just a State of the
*  Union that was unusually focused on his rival, but that was unusually open in the way that
*  it was about his presidential campaign.
*  Yes.
*  And then Biden turns to the economy, where he really has sort of a big task, but also
*  he thinks a big opportunity to try to change the way Americans think about Biden and Biden's
*  record.
*  It doesn't make new, but news in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are
*  writing the greatest comeback story never told.
*  He's sort of retelling the story of the country's recovery from the pandemic recession and
*  trying to cast himself this time, not as the villain who unleashed inflation that Americans
*  are angry about, but as the hero who has created a recovery that's the envy of the world.
*  America's comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy
*  from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
*  And he starts telling the story, running through all the ways in which his policies helped
*  the economy.
*  The racial wealth gap is as small as it's been in 20 years.
*  Wages keep going up.
*  Inflation keeps coming down.
*  Inflation has dropped from 9% to 3%, the lowest in the world and 10% lower.
*  And I got to tell you, Michael, I covered this stuff every day.
*  I know this stuff really well.
*  You do?
*  Biden starts going so fast and sort of so animatedly that it was hard for me to keep up.
*  And now instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we're exporting
*  American products and creating American jobs.
*  It takes him a while to sort of settle down and kind of relax into the speech.
*  But in these economic parts in particular, he's just at times just flying through.
*  Well, you know, I don't think that was an accident.
*  And I think it speaks to one of the things you said about what Biden's goal was tonight,
*  which was to be energetic.
*  I mean, there were moments during the speech I was listening in the same pair of headphones
*  I'm listening to you in where I had to lower the volume and kind of take my headphones
*  off because Biden was almost yelling and it felt like that was a deliberate effort
*  by the president to say, I am so very present and here for this speech.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And the times when he really seemed to relax into it were the times when he kind of broke
*  character almost or broke from the text and needled the Republicans in the crowd.
*  46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities.
*  By the way, I noticed some of you strongly voted against it or they're cheering on that
*  money coming in.
*  So this happens really early on.
*  He's talking about investments from his infrastructure law that have gone to communities all across
*  the country and which, as Biden loves to note, include investments that have been celebrated
*  by some Republican members of Congress who didn't vote for the law.
*  If any of you don't want that money in your district, just let me know.
*  Throughout the speech, though, especially once he settles down, Biden talks about a
*  ton of economic policy and it's very strategic what he chooses to talk about.
*  And I want to make sure the college is more affordable.
*  Let's continue increasing the Pell Grants to working in middle class families and increased
*  record investments in HBCU.
*  He targets young voters who Democrats are really worried about winning in large numbers
*  in this election by talking about his efforts to forgive student loan debt and by proposing
*  new ways to help people who are buying homes, often for the first time, because housing
*  costs are a huge worry among young voters.
*  I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next
*  two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy.
*  Not all of his economic policy here is aimed at young voters.
*  Some of it is much more universal, but even the universal stuff has some real appeals
*  to young people in a way that Joe Biden relates to them, most notably snack food.
*  Probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars.
*  You get you get charged the same amount and you got about, I don't know, 10 percent fewer
*  Snickers in it.
*  He talks about shrinking Snickers bars as an example of corporate greed that's pushing
*  up prices of things with economists called shrinkflation.
*  Same size bag.
*  Put fewer chips in it.
*  No, I'm not joking.
*  And this is like a way for him to move from tangible concerns of young people into another
*  big economic narrative he's trying to tell, which is Joe Biden wants to raise taxes on
*  corporations and kind of wants to stick it to big corporations that he thinks aren't
*  paying their fair share.
*  And Donald Trump, again, unnamed, but very much a main character, is the guy who cut
*  corporate taxes.
*  And Biden is trying to paint him as sympathetic to the interests of the wealthy and big companies
*  over the interests of working people, including young workers.
*  The working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires
*  and billionaires do.
*  It's not fair.
*  We have two ways to go.
*  Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy.
*  That's the proposal.
*  Oh, no.
*  Republicans, by the way, do not take all of these Biden narrative reframings sitting down.
*  They get more and more agitated and start to heckle him.
*  It leads to this much more raucous feeling of the speech as the speech goes on.
*  They really start to have some back and forths with Biden from the lectern.
*  None as sort of stunning as what happens when Biden starts talking about immigration.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Jim, tell us about the section of the speech where Biden broaches immigration.
*  Well, he is trying to continue his effort to flip the script on an issue that is unquestionably
*  difficult for him right now.
*  And he's trying to do it by basically casting himself as more serious about border security
*  legislation than Republicans are.
*  In November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators.
*  He calls out House Republicans for not backing a bipartisan bill from the Senate.
*  The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.
*  Oh, you don't think so?
*  Republicans boo him.
*  Oh, you don't like that bill, huh?
*  And Biden goes right back at them.
*  He basically says, oh, what?
*  You don't like this bill?
*  Conservatives negotiated this bill.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I'll be darned.
*  That's amazing.
*  That bipartisan bill would hire one...
*  And then he ticks through how many more border security agents would be hired and how many
*  more immigration judges and more asylum officers so they can resolve cases faster.
*  He talks about how the Chamber of Commerce has endorsed the bill and the Border Patrol
*  Union.
*  And Republicans are really starting to heckle him now.
*  I know you know how to read.
*  And Biden says at this one point, I know you know how to read.
*  Like you can read the bill.
*  You know what's in it.
*  You guys negotiated it.
*  He says you're blocking this because it would be good for the country, but bad for Trump.
*  And hey...
*  We can fight about fixing the border or we can fix it.
*  I don't think it's about me or about Trump.
*  I think it's good for America.
*  Send me the border bill now.
*  Right.
*  And here Biden is applying what has been up to this point a very pointed critique of Trump
*  to the entire Republican Party as a source of kind of blind partisan opposition to practical
*  solutions and basically a source of government dysfunction.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's at this moment, Michael, when the speech kind of hops the track for a minute.
*  I'd be a winner not a grueling.
*  I...
*  Biden gets interrupted by Marjorie Taylor Greene.
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene is a famously conservative, bombastic, pro-Trump Republican member of
*  Congress from Georgia.
*  And before the speech even starts, when Biden is walking into the House chamber, she hands
*  him a button with the name on it of Lakin Riley, a young nursing student who was killed
*  at the University of Georgia, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant.
*  Right.
*  She hands him this wearing a red MAGA re-elect Trump hat.
*  And she says to him as he's walking by, say her name.
*  Say her name.
*  This has been the conservative call.
*  Say her name, say her name.
*  Joe Biden is denying, they say, violence committed by undocumented immigrants.
*  She starts heckling him on this, on this point, when he's in the immigration section of his
*  speech, and Biden indulges her.
*  How exactly?
*  Biden stops his speech and has almost like a presidential version of a screw it moment.
*  He takes the pin that Marjorie Taylor Greene handed him.
*  He looks at her and he says the name, although he gets it wrong.
*  Lincoln, Lincoln Riley, Lincoln Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an
*  illegal, a young woman killed by an illegal, which is not a phrase that Democrats usually
*  use to talk about undocumented immigrants.
*  And he says to her parents that his heart goes out to them.
*  But then he goes back into his talking points about changing the dynamic at the border to
*  make things better.
*  And he turns it right back on Greene and her colleagues.
*  I would respectfully say to suggest my friend, my Republican friends, owe it to the American
*  people.
*  Get this bill done.
*  We need to act now.
*  And says you owe it to the American people to get this bill done.
*  And it's this amazing moment.
*  Right.
*  What do you make of it?
*  It was definitely off script, but I think it was strategic.
*  Biden had success in last year's speech, baiting Republicans on Social Security.
*  And I think he came into this speech hoping for some more successful exchanges where he
*  could turn conservative and relatively unpopular across the country House Republicans into
*  his foils.
*  And here he is trying to do that.
*  He is strategically engaging with Marjorie Taylor Greene on her terms in order to try
*  to make her the villain in this new story he's telling.
*  You're in the way.
*  You say you hear about this, but you're in the way.
*  Got it.
*  Eventually, Biden turns to yet another hot button issue of very meaningful significance
*  to him electorally.
*  And that is the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
*  This is something I think many of us have been watching for from the start of the speech.
*  And Biden waits and is deep in the speech when he gets there.
*  Then he drops into something we really had not seen to this point in the evening, which
*  was kind of slow, soft, compassionate Joe Biden.
*  And he kind of gets the room suddenly really quiet.
*  I know the last five months have been gut wrenching for so many people, with Israeli
*  people, for the Palestinian people.
*  He talks about knowing how gut wrenching the time since October 7th has been for so many
*  people, for people in Israel, for Palestinians, for Americans.
*  And then he gets to the 250 hostages who were taken by Hamas in that attack.
*  I pledge to all the families that will not rest until we bring everyone of your loved
*  ones home.
*  We also.
*  By starting with the hostages, what Biden does is have a genuinely large bipartisan
*  outburst in the room.
*  But then he has to pivot.
*  Israel has a right to grab Hamas.
*  And he pivots into his support for Israel.
*  And then he pivots into how horrible the human conditions are in Gaza.
*  More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of whom are not Hamas.
*  And laments the deaths and promises more aid for the families who are homeless and hungry
*  and without water.
*  The only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time.
*  And then in the very end, he pivots back to sort of an admonition almost of the Israeli
*  government, which has rejected Biden's preferred end to this entire thing, which is a two-state
*  solution.
*  Right.
*  And in all those pivots, Jim, it feels like you can see a president and a candidate for
*  who is visibly struggling to figure out how to manage all the constituencies in this conflict.
*  Yeah, the way I would put it is that you see a president who does not have a magic solution
*  that can make everyone happy and that also comports with his values.
*  Right.
*  And you see him trying to be responsive to changing facts in the conflict, but not coming
*  anywhere close to changing as fast as many of his critics would want him to.
*  Finally, Biden turns to the elephant in the room, arguably the trickiest subject of all,
*  which is his age and physical and mental readiness to be a second term president.
*  Yeah.
*  Listen, if you cover the White House, even if you write mostly about policy, you've been
*  lectured by people in the White House about how the media writes way too much about Biden's
*  age.
*  But at the same time, the White House is acutely aware of how much of a problem Biden's age
*  is for him in the polls.
*  And this speech turns out in the end to be a direct acknowledgement of that and an attempt,
*  just like with so many other things, to change the narrative.
*  I know it may not look like it, but I've been around a while.
*  Biden takes the age issue head on.
*  When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever.
*  I know the American story.
*  And then he tries, in sort of a Ronald Reagan-esque fashion, to sort of make his age into a good
*  thing, an experienced thing.
*  My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values
*  that define America.
*  Honesty, decency, dignity, equality, to respect everyone, to give everyone a fair job, to
*  give hate no safe harbor.
*  And here is where he tries to use his age and his story to relate back to the narratives
*  he's trying to tell about policy and the country right now.
*  And he ends by trying to contrast himself in advancing age with Trump in advancing age.
*  My fellow Americans, the issue facing our nation isn't how old we are, it's how old
*  our ideas.
*  Hate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas.
*  But you can't lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back.
*  This is like a total critique of Trump.
*  He is saying Trump is like a cranky old man shouting that he wants things to go back to
*  a way that they were and about all the people he's angry at.
*  And that Biden is trying to be this optimist who wants to take us forward and unite the country.
*  You're the reason we've never been more optimistic about our future than I am now.
*  So let's build the future together.
*  Let's remember who we are.
*  We are the United States of America.
*  And there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we act together.
*  God bless you all and may God protect our troops.
*  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
*  In the end, was this an effective speech given all the burdens and challenges that you outlined
*  at the beginning of our conversation?
*  Did President Biden rise to the occasion and will it ultimately matter?
*  Well, we'll have to see what the polls show.
*  But I think two things are important here right away.
*  One is that in the time from when the speech ended until we started taking this episode,
*  I heard from a bunch of Democrats who had been skeptical about the president's ability to
*  deliver a speech with this level of energy who were thrilled with it.
*  And I think on that, he's done an important part of his job, which is to reassure some parts of his coalition.
*  Right.
*  But also there is this rather extraordinary ad that a group of Trump supporters aired earlier in the day
*  that basically went straight at Biden on his age.
*  It was a caricature of a caricature of an old weak man unable to get up the stairs, let alone do the job
*  and implied that he wasn't going to be able to finish out a second term, like live through it.
*  That is a low bar to clear, obviously, for a guy giving a speech to a joint session of Congress.
*  But that's clearly not the guy who showed up at the State of the Union.
*  That is not the guy giving the speech.
*  He coughed, he stumbled.
*  He had some Joe Biden-isms that happened.
*  But he was not an old, frail man who couldn't walk.
*  He basically closed the place down.
*  He hung around talking to members of Congress long after most of the networks had turned off their cameras.
*  And he loved it. He was having a good time.
*  And he was trying really hard to show the world that, hey, like that caricature you saw of me is nothing like reality.
*  With all that said, it's almost impossible to reset narratives and change the way people view things in the span of one speech.
*  Right.
*  Whether that's your performance in the economy or your fitness for office.
*  And so now we're going to see in the span of an actual campaign over the next several months, a campaign that started in earnest this week, whether Biden can do this again and again and again,
*  whether he can have the repetition and the repeat performance that he needs to convince voters that, hey, these narratives, you should rethink them.
*  You should rethink me and you should rethink my record and you should give me another chance and reelect me.
*  Well, Jim, thank you very much.
*  Appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  Lawmakers in Alabama have passed legislation to protect providers of in vitro fertilization from a state Supreme Court ruling that put many of them at legal risk.
*  That ruling found that frozen embryos should be considered children.
*  A finding that all but shut down IVF across the state over fears that damaging or destroying an embryo could become a crime.
*  The new legislation, which was quickly signed into law by Alabama's governor, seeks to ensure that no legal liability exists.
*  As a result, at least one major provider of IVF in the state resumed treatments almost immediately.
*  Today's episode was produced by Mojzady, Alex Stern and Carlos Prieto.
