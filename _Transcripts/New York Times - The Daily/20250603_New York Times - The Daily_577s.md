# The New Co-Hosts of 'The Daily'
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA)
*  Come on in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm going to sit in the middle. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=3.52s)]
*  Okay, I'm taking the flank. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Well, Rachel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=8.24s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=10.6s)]
*  Natalie. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=11.6s)]
*  Hi. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=12.6s)]
*  Welcome to the next chapter of The Daily. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=13.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=16.56s)]
*  Hosted by you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=17.56s)]
*  Well, and you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=18.56s)]
*  It's the three of us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=19.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=20.56s)]
*  The three of us, yep. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=21.56s)]
*  And of course, our listeners know who you are. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=22.56s)]
*  Because you have been distinguished guests over the past eight years of the show, and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=26.48s)]
*  then you were guest hosts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=31.84s)]
*  And now I'm extremely excited to announce you are both becoming my co-hosts. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=34.32s)]
*  They are going to be three of us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=41.88s)]
*  Michael Barbaro, Natalie Kichrowf, Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=44.04s)]
*  And Natalie, you start today, officially. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=48.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Rachel, listeners will know you already started. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  You've been at it for a couple of months. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=55.96s)]
*  Yep. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=57.68s)]
*  And we wanted to take a moment outside of the regular rigors of the show to mark this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=58.68s)]
*  moment and officially share this news with our listeners. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  And honestly, take a few minutes to talk about who you both are, what you did before this, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=69.12s)]
*  why you wanted to be co-hosts of The Daily. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=77.84s)]
*  So I'm going to start, Natalie, with you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=82.24s)]
*  What made you ever want to be a journalist? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=86.0s)]
*  I think that I got to give my mom credit on this one. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=90.88s)]
*  She is a professor of Latin American politics. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=97.08s)]
*  She was always, from when I was really young, doing research in Guatemala. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  And when I turned 12, she started taking me there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=105.72s)]
*  Her research was doing interviews with victims and survivors of the genocide in Guatemala. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  And I would go and do these interviews with her. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=115.84s)]
*  She wasn't just talking with the survivors. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  She also talked to the guerrilla fighters who were part of the conflict. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  She talked to the ex-army commanders who were involved in some of these massacres. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  And so I was going in and out of these often tense conversations and just getting all sides [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=131.56s)]
*  of this very complicated story. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=139.72s)]
*  And I took that with me right out of college when I was looking for a job. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  I realized you could get paid to do this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=145.72s)]
*  And it's basically what I've done ever since. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=148.04s)]
*  And what about you, Rachel? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=149.92s)]
*  I have to follow that? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  God, I'm sorry. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  That's such a good answer. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  No, I might answer. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  My dad was a screenwriter in LA that read comic books, which I read. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  And I was like, Lois Lane's the coolest person. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=161.12s)]
*  A reporter is the coolest person you could be. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=163.56s)]
*  They had to give the man superpowers. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  But she is saving the world because she's smart and dogged and tenacious to speak truth [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  to power and reveal things and uncover things. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=172.96s)]
*  I just want to be that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=175.4s)]
*  And I don't think there was any more thought. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=176.72s)]
*  That is the coolest way to do good in the world. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=179.0s)]
*  And once you actually became a journalist, when did you feel you were realizing that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=183.08s)]
*  goal? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=188.52s)]
*  Really early in my career at the Times, there was a story I worked on that I think will [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=190.52s)]
*  probably stay with me forever. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=194.20000000000002s)]
*  General Motors was having this issue where their cars were just suddenly shutting off [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=196.4s)]
*  while people were driving them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=199.68s)]
*  And obviously, people were crashing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  There were a lot of deaths. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=202.8s)]
*  Every reporter was trying to figure out who had died, piecing together various federal [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=204.36s)]
*  to find the earliest victims, to notify them or to notify their survivors, their families, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=209.36s)]
*  to let them know you didn't just have an accident. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=214.84s)]
*  Your car malfunctioned. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  You didn't do anything wrong. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=219.28s)]
*  You didn't do anything wrong. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=220.28s)]
*  And reporters around the country, including a team I was on, we had basically identified [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=221.96s)]
*  all these people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=226.36s)]
*  But there was one person in one of the earliest, if not the earliest crash, and nobody could [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=227.86s)]
*  find her name. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=233.16000000000003s)]
*  And everybody was looking for it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=234.84s)]
*  And I was like, I will find this person. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  And I probably made 100 phone calls to everybody that might know somebody who knows somebody [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  who knows somebody. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=243.4s)]
*  And eventually, I found someone. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=244.4s)]
*  It was a woman whose car had driven off the road and she had crashed into a tree and she [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=246.60000000000002s)]
*  had died. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  And I tracked down her family. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  And up until then, they had no idea. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  They thought maybe she had a heart attack. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=255.08s)]
*  It was this lingering mystery. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=256.08000000000004s)]
*  And they finally got some sort of closure. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=258.32s)]
*  And I know that there was a compensation fund that existed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=260.14s)]
*  And by telling them, they actually had a chance to apply for it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  So anyway, that was the thing where I was like, if I didn't do that, they would have [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=265.24s)]
*  never known. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=268.72s)]
*  And that would have been that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=269.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=271.32s)]
*  I mean, that's public service. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=272.32s)]
*  I was really proud of it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=274.04s)]
*  Natalie, as we've already hinted at, you take the lessons that you drew from your mom's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  work and you become one of the greatest correspondents I can recall in Mexico City. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=280.76s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=288.72s)]
*  And I wonder when all those lessons apply clearly in your work. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=289.8s)]
*  I think really the most recent stories that I did are the clearest example of how those [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  lessons I learned early on began to apply. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=302.36s)]
*  Because I spent, as you know, because we talked about on the show, several months investigating [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=305.6s)]
*  the Sinaloa Cartel as a way of understanding the fentanyl crisis that was killing tens [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=310.58000000000004s)]
*  of thousands of Americans. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=315.76s)]
*  We really tried to get inside the cartel by going to Sinaloa, visiting a fentanyl lab [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=317.92s)]
*  where they were cooking and producing the drug, talking to chemists. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=325.72s)]
*  We talked to people who were tested on by the cartels as they were looking to perfect [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=331.36s)]
*  their formulas for these drugs. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=336.16s)]
*  It was risky. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=338.06s)]
*  It was dangerous. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=339.06s)]
*  But it was the only way that I knew to try to understand how this billion dollar business [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=340.06s)]
*  behind this incredibly lethal drug actually worked. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=345.56s)]
*  And yeah, I was reminded of all of those hours in a car going up to the mountains, sitting [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=349.48s)]
*  and just listening with my mom. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=355.16s)]
*  So then why, both of you, but start with you, Natalie, why leave print and come here on [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=357.8s)]
*  the daily full time? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=364.16s)]
*  I mean, I love the daily. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=365.92s)]
*  I remember when the show first started and it oriented me as a reporter covering this [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=367.56s)]
*  world, I needed to listen to what was on the daily because it helped me think about coverage. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=372.88s)]
*  And then I got to be a guest on the show. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=378.64s)]
*  As we said, I worked with some of the very same editors and producers who are still running [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=380.36s)]
*  this show. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=387.88s)]
*  So it feels like it's been a home away from home for me for a long time now. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=389.36s)]
*  And so I'm excited to make it permanent. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  And you, Rachel? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=399.0s)]
*  Well, another line of reporting that I did years after the General Motors stuff was I [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=400.16s)]
*  was involved in the papers coverage of the Me Too movement. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=405.16s)]
*  And one of the stories involved a woman who lost her law license because she was a source [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=408.84s)]
*  to us. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=412.56s)]
*  But eventually she reached out to me and said, I kind of want to talk about why I leaked. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=413.56s)]
*  And we had lunch and I listened to her and I eventually said, the daily is where I think [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=417.72s)]
*  your story belongs. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=422.12s)]
*  I just feel like audio can just do something for the story. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=423.28s)]
*  And you were right. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=426.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=427.0s)]
*  And it was incredible to listen to her. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=428.0s)]
*  And that's what brought me to the show first. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=429.0s)]
*  After that, I started guest hosting with you guys. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=430.88s)]
*  So there it is. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=432.76s)]
*  Can we start talking about you? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=433.76s)]
*  Yeah, can we start talking about you? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=434.76s)]
*  Do you have any questions? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=435.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=436.76s)]
*  We have so many questions. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=437.76s)]
*  But the basic one, how do you think about this job? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=439.68s)]
*  About hosting the show? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=444.0s)]
*  I think the job is to imagine that someone is at home, maybe doing their dishes or on [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=445.72s)]
*  listening to the show and they're plugged in, but there's also like passing trains and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=455.12s)]
*  kids running behind them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=461.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=462.32s)]
*  A million things going on. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=463.32s)]
*  There's things going on. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=464.32s)]
*  And the job is to ensure that I'm standing in for them. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=465.32s)]
*  Are they about to be confused by something? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=470.44s)]
*  It's my job to clarify it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=472.16s)]
*  Is there some deeper meaning behind something that I can get at on their behalf? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=473.6s)]
*  That's my job. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=478.8s)]
*  So the job is to fiercely advocate for the listener in every conversation, whether it's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=480.32s)]
*  with a farmer in Iowa or the president of Princeton University like you just did, Rachel, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  or Natalie with the whistleblower from Boeing or any of our 1500 colleagues who are the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=491.52s)]
*  beating heart of this show. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=497.0s)]
*  And the real challenge is standing in for the listener while also yourself being really [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=499.0s)]
*  present in the conversation. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=505.74s)]
*  It's kind of like those two jobs at once that is the challenge. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=507.28000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=511.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=512.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=513.04s)]
*  We are reaching the end of our conversation here. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=514.04s)]
*  And I just want to tell you both how much I am looking forward to working with you as [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=516.8s)]
*  my co-host. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=523.08s)]
*  I think it's going to be a lot of fun and I think we're going to do great things. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=524.08s)]
*  Me too. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  Me three. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=529.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm really excited. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to say thank you in that kind of like classic way. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=531.5600000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  Can I? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do the honors. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=536.68s)]
*  Please. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=537.68s)]
*  Is that okay? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=538.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSdlMrWj0gA&t=539.68s)]
