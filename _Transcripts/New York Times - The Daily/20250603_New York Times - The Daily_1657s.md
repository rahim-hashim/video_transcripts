# A 1,400-County Crisis for Democrats
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=4.48s)]
*  It's now conventional wisdom that Donald Trump has transformed American politics. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=13.84s)]
*  But a county-by-county voting analysis from the Times covering the last four presidential [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=19.32s)]
*  races shows just how drastically Trump has changed the electoral map. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=24.8s)]
*  Today, the reporter who conducted that analysis, Shane Goldmacher, on why it's a five alarm [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=32.36s)]
*  fire for the Democrats and the debate within the party over what to do about it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=40.32s)]
*  It's Tuesday, June 3rd. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=54.8s)]
*  Hey there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=61.8s)]
*  How's it going? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=65.8s)]
*  Very well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=69.8s)]
*  I appreciate that tie. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=70.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=72.8s)]
*  It's just for you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=73.8s)]
*  It really, really shows up on audio. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=74.8s)]
*  I think people can hear, they can hear the constriction. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=78.16s)]
*  That there's a tie. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=80.8s)]
*  And the formality. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=81.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=82.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=83.8s)]
*  Let's get started. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=84.8s)]
*  Shane, always a pleasure. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=85.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=86.8s)]
*  So you're officially on what I would think of as the what went wrong with the Democrats [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=88.96s)]
*  beat. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=95.32s)]
*  Democrats and disarray beat on a non-week ago. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=96.52s)]
*  Democrats on a rowboat without a oar beat. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=99.12s)]
*  And the people trying to grab an oar, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=101.92s)]
*  How they're trying to rebuild from what went wrong. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  And this is now becoming a somewhat formal line of coverage for you and for many of our [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=107.0s)]
*  colleagues on the politics desk in the aftermath of the last presidential race. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  You're making something of a formal study of what went wrong and where the party needs [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=116.68s)]
*  to go. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=121.2s)]
*  And you started, I think quite logically, with a very deep dive into data. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that a lot of people have looked at the 2024 election and said this was an [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=128.6s)]
*  outlier for the Democrats. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=135.4s)]
*  That the Democratic party lost because Joe Biden was too old. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=137.36s)]
*  That he stayed in the race too long. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  That Kamala Harris was a weaker candidate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=143.16000000000003s)]
*  That she didn't have enough time to prosecute the case. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  And on and on. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  But the 2024 election results were not a one-off. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  They weren't a one-off at all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  In fact, they really trace an improvement that Trump and the Republican Party have been [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  making since Donald Trump arrived on the political scene. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=157.8s)]
*  And so I decided to look back over the last four elections at every county election result [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=161.24s)]
*  dating back to the entire time Trump has been running and once before to set a baseline. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=167.84s)]
*  Every county in the United States. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=173.44s)]
*  Yeah, so more than. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=174.44s)]
*  How many counties are in the United States? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=175.44s)]
*  There are more than 3,100 counties in the country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=176.44s)]
*  And so you said dating back to 2012. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=178.84s)]
*  And why starting there? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  Because that's the last election that Donald Trump wasn't on the ballot. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=182.68s)]
*  So what did the balance between Democrats and Republicans look like in the last snapshot [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  where this wasn't a Trump-led Republican Party? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  And how has Trump transformed the political landscape in the three consecutive times [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=195.56s)]
*  he's been on the ballot? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=200.24s)]
*  And what I found was really a flashing alarm sign for the Democratic Party. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=201.96s)]
*  Describe exactly what you found and why it's a flashing alarm. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=209.16s)]
*  It's a flashing alarm that's a sea of red. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=211.84s)]
*  So more than 1,400 counties in the country have trended continuously in the Republican [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  direction since Trump has been on the ballot. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=221.84s)]
*  So about half of all of the nation's counties. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=225.36s)]
*  Nearly half of the counties in the entire country have trended Republican and less than [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=227.88000000000002s)]
*  2% of the nation's counties have trended Democratic. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=232.68s)]
*  Only 57 of the counties in the entire country have moved continuously to the left. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=237.36s)]
*  Wow, hugely disproportionate. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  Hugely disproportionate. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=245.16000000000003s)]
*  And look, the total number of people living in these Republican moving counties, way outnumbered [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  the number of people living in these continuously Democratic moving counties. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=252.52s)]
*  There's something around 42 million to 8 million people. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=256.2s)]
*  Basically that data suggests that Republicans are improving their relationship to more and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=259.44s)]
*  more voters in more and more places while Democrats are not. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=266.62s)]
*  And I think that while that top line number is scary enough for the Democratic Party, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=271.44s)]
*  it's actually the complexion of those counties that is most concerning. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=276.76s)]
*  We'll talk about that complexion for both kinds of counties. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=282.44s)]
*  Those moving further and further toward the Republican side and the pretty small number [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=286.6s)]
*  that are moving farther and farther toward the Democratic side. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=291.68s)]
*  Well, let's start with the Democrats because they're improving in so many fewer places. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=295.76s)]
*  They're basically only doing better in the richest corners of the country and the most [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=302.32s)]
*  educated corners of the country. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=307.6s)]
*  And on the flip side, Trump is doing better in working class parts of the country everywhere. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=310.48s)]
*  So yes, we know that Donald Trump has done well in white rural parts of America. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=317.1s)]
*  He's doing even better now than he did when he first came onto the political scene. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=322.6s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=326.8s)]
*  The other part is he is doing better in working class parts of the country that are diverse. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=327.8s)]
*  Inner cities, black neighborhoods, Latino neighborhoods, big, big cities, smaller towns [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  in the south, all across the country, diverse places, Donald Trump has been doing better. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=339.14s)]
*  Not once, not twice, three times in a row. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=343.53999999999996s)]
*  In 2016, he improved for the party. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  In 2020, he improved for the party. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  And then again in 2024. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=351.08s)]
*  What these maps showed is that his victory was the culmination of a set of improvements [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=353.78s)]
*  that Trump has been making among working class voters and diverse voters for a decade. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=359.97999999999996s)]
*  Can you give us a couple of examples of some of the counties you're talking about? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=365.54s)]
*  Maybe let's start with one of the counties that keeps becoming more and more blue, more [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=370.32s)]
*  Democrat, that is rich, that is highly educated. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=376.70000000000005s)]
*  And then let's move to a county or two where the Republicans keep gaining over the last [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  three elections. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=386.62s)]
*  It seems to be more working class. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=387.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=389.3s)]
*  I mean, so when you look at a map and you see these sort of splotches of blue, they're [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=390.3s)]
*  really concentrated around a few places. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=394.78s)]
*  One of the places that sort of stood out was Los Alamos, New Mexico. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=397.78s)]
*  And it was like, oh, this is interesting. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=402.7s)]
*  Why is this a little beacon for the Democratic Party in New Mexico? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  In the southwest, there's not a lot of those here, right? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=408.17999999999995s)]
*  So this was a triple trending, continuously moving towards Democrat county in a part of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=410.41999999999996s)]
*  the country that, as you just said, is generally quite Republican. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=416.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  So, well, why is it? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, turns out Los Alamos is the home of Los Alamos National Laboratory, which of course [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=422.78s)]
*  is famous for helping develop the atomic bomb. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=429.05999999999995s)]
*  It is one of the leading scientific laboratories in the country. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  And what that means is there's a whole bunch of people there who are making a lot of money [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  and who have a lot of college education. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=442.34s)]
*  And so Los Alamos is this one little blue arrow in the Democratic direction in the southwest [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=445.41999999999996s)]
*  because it is one of the highest income, highest educated corners of the country. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=451.5s)]
*  On the flip side is Texas. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=457.54s)]
*  Probably the most alarming single state in the country for Democrats is looking at the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=459.94s)]
*  Republican gains all along the border in South Texas. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=464.98s)]
*  And the county that jumps out to me there is Star County. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=470.14s)]
*  Star County is the county that has moved the most in the entire country from 2012 to 2024. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=473.98s)]
*  This is a county that Barack Obama won overwhelmingly in 2012 and that Donald Trump won comfortably [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=482.17999999999995s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=492.06s)]
*  So it's moved continuously to the Republican side. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=493.06s)]
*  It's moved continuously in the Republican direction and the sum of that movement is [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=497.41999999999996s)]
*  89 percentage points. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=502.85999999999996s)]
*  And what's interesting is Star County isn't just the county that has moved the most. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=505.5s)]
*  It also is the most predominantly Latino county in America. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=510.06s)]
*  And it's not just shifting away from the Democratic Party. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=515.1s)]
*  It's stampeding away from the Democratic Party. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=519.14s)]
*  And while Star County is this one small county in the Texas border, what you see is that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=522.7s)]
*  same type of movement in counties with broad Latino populations. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=528.54s)]
*  Whether you're talking about the Bronx in New York City, Queens, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=534.7s)]
*  places with diverse populations have moved steadily to the right. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=541.6s)]
*  Even in a lot of them where Democrats are still winning, they're winning by less and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=545.0s)]
*  by a lot less. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, to use like a fancy political science term, we're talking about racial depolarization. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=550.24s)]
*  Just translate that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=556.48s)]
*  Yeah, for a long time, one of the most important markers of how a person was going to vote [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=557.48s)]
*  in America was what race are you? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=562.0s)]
*  Are you black? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=564.76s)]
*  Are you Latino? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=565.76s)]
*  Are you white? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=566.76s)]
*  That was the single greatest predictor. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=567.76s)]
*  And it's still an incredibly powerful predictor. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=569.1s)]
*  But what we see here is that Trump is changing that and that class is becoming the greatest [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=571.62s)]
*  predictor, important predictor. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=577.84s)]
*  And by laying this out over time, you see that this isn't a one election shift. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=580.12s)]
*  This is a steady shift. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=584.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=586.24s)]
*  And Trump has done to some degree has created a class based electoral monolith. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=587.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=594.2s)]
*  And this is a threat for Democrats because there are more people in America who didn't [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=595.2s)]
*  go to college than there are people in America who did go to college. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=600.04s)]
*  There are more people in America who are working class than there are people who are upper [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=604.36s)]
*  class. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=609.4s)]
*  If you look at education, there is not a single county in the country of the 1400 where Trump [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=610.72s)]
*  has continuously improved, not a single county that a majority of people had a college degree. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=618.88s)]
*  Not a single county. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=624.48s)]
*  And on the flip side, there's not a single county where the Democrats have continuously [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=625.48s)]
*  improved where less than 20% of people had a college degree. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=629.0600000000001s)]
*  That's really stark. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=634.2s)]
*  Of the 1433 counties where Trump has improved continuously, only three had a median income [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=635.2s)]
*  of more than $100,000. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=644.4000000000001s)]
*  So like way less than 1%. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=646.76s)]
*  On the Democratic side, only 57 counties have moved to the Democrats. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=650.2800000000001s)]
*  18 of them have an income of $100,000 per household. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=654.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=660.0s)]
*  So the Democrats are just improving where these wealthy enclaves are, and Republicans [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=661.2s)]
*  are improving just about everywhere else. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=665.68s)]
*  And for those of us with some gray in our hair, what is astonishing about what you're [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=668.72s)]
*  describing is how much it represents an inversion of the party's reputations and even self-identification [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=673.48s)]
*  25, 30 years ago. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=684.0s)]
*  Democrats operated, they told themselves and their election results demonstrated this, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=687.36s)]
*  as the party of working America. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=693.12s)]
*  And Republicans were the party of wealthy America. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=697.32s)]
*  And what you're describing is a complete, to some degree, not just an inversion, but [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=702.28s)]
*  a kind of annihilation of those reputations. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=707.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think it's the scope of the Democratic Party's defeat last fall and the increasing [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=710.44s)]
*  realization that this wasn't a one-off that's led to the Democratic Party soul-searching [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=716.8s)]
*  right now for what it stands for. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=723.28s)]
*  For years, the Democratic Party has basically identified itself as the party of the working [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=728.88s)]
*  class. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=734.92s)]
*  It's a core part of the party's identity. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=735.92s)]
*  And the results show that working class voters no longer see the party that way. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=738.92s)]
*  And at the same time, the party has banked on more diversity helping, that a more diverse [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=744.68s)]
*  America was going to be a more democratic America. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=750.8s)]
*  And both of those things are no longer necessarily true. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=755.16s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=765.08s)]
*  Shane, when you came up with this county by county painstaking data, you shared it with [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=774.8s)]
*  a lot of Democratic strategists and elected officials to get their reaction. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=781.76s)]
*  So what was their reaction to it? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=786.6s)]
*  And how much did it surprise them? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=789.84s)]
*  I think a lot of them were not surprised at the directionality of this information, right? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=791.72s)]
*  This sort of fits with our understanding of the most recent election. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=797.6s)]
*  I think people were more surprised by the depth and the scale of it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=801.4s)]
*  And what it captured is the conversation that they're having, which is there is an urgency [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=806.36s)]
*  for the Democratic Party to find ways to stop hemorrhaging support among working class Americans. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  And there is a crisis for the Democratic Party that the erosion among Latino voters has come [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=818.88s)]
*  as the Republican Party has embraced a leader in Donald Trump who has made border security [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=825.0s)]
*  his top priority, who has demonized at times Latinos. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  And so the party is looking at this and saying, my goodness, we are losing ground at this [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=835.68s)]
*  moment to this opponent. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=840.36s)]
*  What does that mean about what our message is right now? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=842.9399999999999s)]
*  OK, and what's the answer? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=845.28s)]
*  How much do the Democrats surveying the record chair and looking in particular at the data [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=847.16s)]
*  that you are finding? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=852.56s)]
*  Think of this as a policy matter. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=854.7199999999999s)]
*  As Democrats have chosen the wrong side of a set of issues, for example, like border [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=857.24s)]
*  security and immigration. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=863.26s)]
*  I mean, I think that there's two different fights that are happening simultaneously in [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=865.48s)]
*  the Democratic Party around these questions. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=869.08s)]
*  The first is about policy. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=872.14s)]
*  Does the party need to shift what it stands for? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=874.6800000000001s)]
*  I think immigration might be the single most important issue where the most robust debate [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=877.0s)]
*  is happening. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=881.44s)]
*  The other side is, does the Democratic Party need to shift its posture, how it represents [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=882.86s)]
*  itself to the country, how it appears, what it is fighting for? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=888.66s)]
*  Are you advocating for working people explicitly? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=892.4s)]
*  Are you focusing on economic programs that are targeted to the needs that people have, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=896.14s)]
*  the costs that they're experiencing, not talking about things like student loan debt repayment [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=901.54s)]
*  where you only got this if you went to college? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=907.3000000000001s)]
*  This is something that came up in my reporting, talking to voters in 2023 and 2024. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=912.4200000000001s)]
*  People would say, well, I didn't go to college. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=918.38s)]
*  Those guys got to go to college. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=921.0200000000001s)]
*  Why are we giving them money? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=922.38s)]
*  Even if that program on a policy basis was targeted at lower income earners, was targeted [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=926.0600000000001s)]
*  at diverse communities, the feeling was, well, the Democratic Party is the party of college [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=932.1s)]
*  educated elites and they're giving money back to college educated elites, regardless [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=936.78s)]
*  of the specifics of how the policy was crafted. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=941.5799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=944.02s)]
*  That would be a really vivid example of where Democrats put a lot of their eggs in a basket [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=945.02s)]
*  that mathematically they already had. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=950.98s)]
*  They weren't going to reach the voters that, as your reporting shows, they're losing. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=954.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=959.02s)]
*  I think that not everyone is totally alarmed about the Democratic Party's future based [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=960.02s)]
*  on these numbers. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=964.3s)]
*  Even if they're concerned, I think one of the more interesting people I spoke to was [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=965.3s)]
*  Richie Torres, who's a congressman from the Bronx here in New York City who represents [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=968.9799999999999s)]
*  one of those triple trending Republican districts. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=973.74s)]
*  A Democrat in Congress whose district has gone continuously more to the right over the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=976.8599999999999s)]
*  last three presidential races. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=982.2199999999999s)]
*  That's a fascinating conversation. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=983.4599999999999s)]
*  And his district at one point was the single most Democratic district in America. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=985.26s)]
*  This isn't just a Democratic seat. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  This is like the heart of a Democratic struggle. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=992.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=994.94s)]
*  So he's at the epicenter of the plates shifting. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=995.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=998.1800000000001s)]
*  And so Richie Torres said, look, this is a huge deal. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=999.1800000000001s)]
*  And he's really worried about that for his party. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1001.9000000000001s)]
*  But he also said, look, you know, we talk a lot about the Democrats. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1005.46s)]
*  Maybe it's just Trump. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1009.0600000000001s)]
*  Maybe Trump is just a singular figure. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1010.82s)]
*  And when he goes away, some of these issues go away. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1012.58s)]
*  What if the Republican Party is defined by somebody else? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1016.2800000000001s)]
*  What if it's the party of JD Vance or Marco Rubio or basically anyone who's not Donald [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1018.6600000000001s)]
*  Trump? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1023.22s)]
*  What if the party of Donald Trump outlasts? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1024.22s)]
*  And he very much was unclear on the answer whether the Democratic Party's problems can [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1025.22s)]
*  be resuscitated simply by not running against a candidate like Trump. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1030.78s)]
*  Yeah, this is the blip theory of the Trump era. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1035.46s)]
*  On its face, it feels a touch naive with all due respect to Congressman Torres, because [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1038.78s)]
*  this is Donald Trump's Republican Party right now, right? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1045.6200000000001s)]
*  the next nominee isn't working really hard to inhabit his mold. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1049.92s)]
*  It will be someone who probably embraces all of the same policies. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1055.96s)]
*  Well then you get back to that. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1060.16s)]
*  Is it policy or is it perception? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1061.16s)]
*  Ah, I see your point. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1062.72s)]
*  Is how Donald Trump perceived by voters because he was the host of The Apprentice, because [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1064.0800000000002s)]
*  of his years of being on the public scene, is there something just to Trump that is driving [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1069.1200000000001s)]
*  this more than all of these other demographic factors? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1074.0800000000002s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1077.88s)]
*  There are lots of other Democrats. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1079.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, what's the other theories? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1080.0400000000002s)]
*  There are lots of other theories. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1081.88s)]
*  Like the Democratic Party needs to stop talking the way it's talking because they're not talking [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1082.88s)]
*  in ways that people are connecting to. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1087.3600000000001s)]
*  Look, there are studies after studies. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1089.96s)]
*  There are groups lining up, focus groups to talk to people all the time. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1092.64s)]
*  Let's get a sense of like, how do people feel about the Democratic Party right now? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1096.1200000000001s)]
*  And you know, one person I talked to has done a ton of these focus groups for years. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1101.0400000000002s)]
*  She is sitting down with disaffected Democratic voters, swing voters, and she asks these voters, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1105.4s)]
*  how do you feel about the two parties, but not asking directly. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1112.72s)]
*  Instead, she asks, what animal do you think the Republican Party is? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1115.8400000000001s)]
*  And the answers these voters have given fall into like really clear trends. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1121.16s)]
*  And the number one trend is that these voters say that Republicans are like lions and tigers [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1125.68s)]
*  and bears. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1132.88s)]
*  Oh my. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1133.88s)]
*  They take what they want and just devour things. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1135.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1138.44s)]
*  They just, if they want it, they take it, they get it. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1139.44s)]
*  And Democrats are three toed sloths and slugs and tortoises, sort of slow animals. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1141.56s)]
*  Not aggressive. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1149.76s)]
*  Are not aggressive, are the prey. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1150.76s)]
*  And they may not like that the Republican Party is lions and devouring things, but it [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1152.72s)]
*  feels pretty revealing about the Democratic Party's brand that it's these other animals. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1159.56s)]
*  What these focus groups would seem to reveal, and this is in opposition to what Congressman [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1165.16s)]
*  Torres is saying, is that this is a brand wide Democratic image problem, not a question [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1169.5600000000002s)]
*  of Trump potentially being a blip. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1176.52s)]
*  Because Donald Trump can go away and you still have a lot of these voters telling the focus [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1178.4s)]
*  group leader that the Democrats are the sloth. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1183.96s)]
*  And so I think one of the things you're seeing is people fill the void to show that the party [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1187.44s)]
*  is not a sloth anymore. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1193.36s)]
*  And that looks like Bernie Sanders going all across the country to red states, to places [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1196.3999999999999s)]
*  like Idaho and drawing big crowds to blue cities. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1202.24s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, these are Democrats who are saying- [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1205.6799999999998s)]
*  Go on the offense. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1208.84s)]
*  We can go on the offense and we can even move to the left on policy, embrace an economic [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1209.84s)]
*  can appeal to those working class voters of all diversities by saying the man is oppressing [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1217.32s)]
*  you, corporations are oppressing you, we need to go and take back power, we the people. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1224.36s)]
*  But there's a different faction of the Democratic Party that is moderate, that does not want [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1230.6799999999998s)]
*  to move that direction. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1237.28s)]
*  This is the policies that Bernie Sanders and AOC are advocating. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1238.28s)]
*  They might draw a crowd, but they're going to lose you in election because while they [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1242.12s)]
*  are fighting, they're fighting for things that are not ultimately popular in polling, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1247.6799999999998s)]
*  whether it's immigration, whether it's a whole series of things that they say for Democrats [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1252.7199999999998s)]
*  to win back these voters, we need to moderate. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1258.8s)]
*  What you're describing is a pretty familiar dynamic within the Democratic Party, this [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1262.4799999999998s)]
*  binary where a populist movement that positions itself explicitly as anti-elite offers itself [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1266.96s)]
*  up and to some degree takes root and the moderate wing is afraid of it and tries to snuff it [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1275.2s)]
*  out and in many cases has succeeded in overcoming the populist wing of the party. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1281.76s)]
*  But the data that is at the center of our conversation here suggests that the party's [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1287.6200000000001s)]
*  greatest need is to recognize that racial depolarization and the fact that its future [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1292.48s)]
*  lies with a working class group of Americans, white, black, Latino, who are drifting further [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1298.68s)]
*  and further away from it and towards Republicans and Donald Trump and who don't like what the [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1304.44s)]
*  Democratic Party has stood for up until now on immigration, where compared to the Republican [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1312.0s)]
*  Party of Trump, it's seen as insufficiently law and order or on trade, where Democrats [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1317.34s)]
*  are seen as backing free trade policies that destroyed manufacturing jobs or on the government [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1322.34s)]
*  itself or Democrats are seen as the defender of a bloated ineffectual establishment. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1326.9399999999998s)]
*  So doesn't that suggest that the Democrats' future lies, and I'm being provocative here, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1333.0s)]
*  but in a more populist version of itself, doesn't the president's success in all these [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1339.86s)]
*  counties over the last three elections suggest that some form of populism is undeniably effective? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1346.0s)]
*  I think that there's no debate that the Democratic Party does not have a future if it can't make [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1353.72s)]
*  inroads again with working class voters. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1361.68s)]
*  What you do to become that party is very much still up for debate. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1365.0s)]
*  I also think we should note that coming up with what the solutions are in the months [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1370.96s)]
*  after an election is like a notoriously hard thing to do. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1375.56s)]
*  And so no, I don't think you necessarily have to move in one particular direction. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1380.96s)]
*  I think a lot of the energy right now in the Democratic Party is talking about moving in [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1386.36s)]
*  a more populist direction and finding something that sounds and feels like populism to voters, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  something that communicates that the party is unhappy with the status quo too, because [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1398.1599999999999s)]
*  voters are unhappy with the status quo. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1404.56s)]
*  So you have to tap into where voters are and voters are upset. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1406.52s)]
*  The thing I'm hearing most from Democrats is a fear that the party won't make any major [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1410.36s)]
*  changes and will still succeed in 2026. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1415.9199999999998s)]
*  This next midterm. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1420.08s)]
*  This next midterm. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1421.12s)]
*  Because guess what? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1422.32s)]
*  In midterm elections, more highly educated, higher income voters turn out in higher numbers. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1423.3999999999999s)]
*  The places that have moved more democratic, those are the places more likely to turn out. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1430.3999999999999s)]
*  The voters who have moved more democratic are more likely to turn out. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1434.44s)]
*  And so the party might win the House in 2026, might do better than expected in some of these [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1439.0s)]
*  Senate races. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1446.0800000000002s)]
*  And the fear is that that overperformance could mask the deeper issues that are plaguing the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1447.3200000000002s)]
*  party. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1454.56s)]
*  And if you don't solve those problems now, that you will wake up to another results in [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1455.56s)]
*  2028, where the country is again shifted to the right and elected another Republican [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1460.28s)]
*  as president. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1465.96s)]
*  Well, Shane, thank you very much. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1466.96s)]

*  year and had wanted to kill, quote, all Zionist people. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1519.08s)]
*  And. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUstgK1opsg&t=1526.08s)]
