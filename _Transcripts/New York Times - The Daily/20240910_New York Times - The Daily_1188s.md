# Judge Delays Trump Sentencing Until After Election
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF8GWuq4k7Q)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Last week, a judge in Manhattan announced he was delaying the sentencing of former President
*  Donald Trump until after the election in the only one of the four criminal cases that will
*  have gone to trial before voters go to the polls.
*  Today, my colleague Ben protests on Trump's remarkable legal win and its limits.
*  It's Tuesday, September 10th.
*  So Ben, we got some news last week in the Trump trial that had ended in 34 felony convictions.
*  Tell me what happened.
*  So Trump was supposed to be sentenced this month, and this was all in the Manhattan criminal
*  case where he was convicted of covering up a hush money deal with the porn stars, you
*  might recall. And so he faces up to four years in prison.
*  But on Friday, this surprise announcement comes.
*  A legal and political victory for Donald Trump.
*  The judge in the case, his name is Juan Roshon, he comes out and he says, actually,
*  the sentencing is going to be delayed.
*  New York Justice Juan Roshon has ruled former President Donald Trump will be sentenced
*  November 26th, three weeks after the election.
*  And now instead of it occurring in September, a couple of weeks from now, it's going to
*  be scheduled for November.
*  Judge Roshon writing his decision best advances the interests of justice, noting this matter
*  is one that stands alone.
*  So really what this means is that Trump will not be sentenced prior to the election after
*  all. And so it all adds up to the fact that we have this first former American
*  president to be a felon.
*  And here he is. He's running for office yet again.
*  And voters are going to be heading to the polls soon and they won't know what his
*  punishment is.
*  That seems very consequential.
*  Let's try to unpack that.
*  So thinking back to May when he was first convicted, the timing of his sentencing at
*  that point didn't really seem to be in question.
*  Like it was just the course of the regular legal process.
*  So what happened?
*  So you're right. Originally, he was scheduled to be sentenced on July 11th.
*  But on July 1st, you might recall, the Supreme Court issued this very consequential
*  landmark decision that said that a former president cannot be prosecuted for official
*  acts that they committed as president while in the White House.
*  This is the immunity decision.
*  Exactly. And so, you know, there's still much to be learned and interpreted from this
*  decision. But basically within hours, Trump's lawyers in New York move to throw out the
*  conviction because they think now the Supreme Court opinion gives their client immunity
*  even in this case.
*  And that means in their minds that the judge cannot sentence him as planned on July 11th.
*  Basically, they feel that the judge needs to first consider whether or not to throw
*  out the case altogether.
*  And is there any validity in the argument that Trump's lawyers are making?
*  I mean, that the Supreme Court immunity decision could undermine his conviction?
*  Look, it's a long shot.
*  Almost all of the evidence in this case involves the time period before he was president.
*  It involves payments to a porn star that were made before his presidency.
*  That being said, he did make a few payments to reimburse his fixer, Michael Cohen, for
*  the hush money while he was president.
*  Now, is that an official act?
*  I think most people, including the judge, Juan Marchand, will conclude no, that was
*  not an official act. But his lawyers will still try it and they'll argue that the
*  prosecutors did try to introduce evidence that involved Trump's time in office.
*  So after he filed the immunity petition, that's what pushed the sentencing back all
*  the way to after Labor Day, September 18th.
*  That's when we were supposed to see him receive his punishment.
*  Got it. So it sounds like this whole immunity decision is essentially a delay tactic
*  for Trump and his legal team.
*  As you're saying, Trump can't be sentenced until the judge rules on immunity and
*  essentially decides whether the immunity decision would have any role in undermining
*  the hush money case.
*  Correct. It's exactly right.
*  I guess I'm wondering how much is Election Day a consideration in the delays for this
*  judge?
*  Election Day made this a lose-lose proposition for the judge.
*  Either he was going to alienate one half of the country or he was going to alienate
*  the other half. So if he had not delayed, he would have faced accusations from Trump
*  and Trump supporters that he was interfering in the election.
*  And his decision to delay essentially drew a lot of criticism and a lot of concerns
*  from people across the country, especially on the left, that Donald Trump is above the
*  law, that he is not subject to the same rules as every other criminal defendant in the
*  country. Now, the judge, I think, anticipating these questions and these concerns, sort of
*  used his opinion as an endorsement of the court system to work around, to navigate
*  around the political sphere.
*  And he wanted to remove the sentencing from this highly charged, partisan environment
*  leading up to the election.
*  So he sort of calls the court system a fair, impartial, apolitical institution.
*  He talks about the sentencing dispelling any notion that there are political considerations
*  involved in this really important sentencing decision.
*  In his mind, yes, the sentencing has to be done and yes, this election has to occur.
*  But the fact that they were on this collision course seemed clearly to him to be
*  problematic. He notes that there is this unique time frame that the case was in and
*  there's no way around that. But he was trying to essentially, it seems, remove it from
*  that unique time frame.
*  And do we know, Ben, just legally, how much the judge is allowed to even be thinking
*  about the election when he's making this decision?
*  So we just have no precedent for it.
*  And we just don't know kind of what was in his head, too, about what he thought he was
*  allowed to do under the law.
*  So instead of sort of making a legal decision, he seemed to sort of make what was a
*  practical decision without much consideration to any case law, because quite frankly, this
*  has never happened before.
*  OK, so Judge Marchand has had to contend with a lot of competing pressures here.
*  Sentencing and the timing of that, the immunity request and the timing of that, but also
*  the election. Tell us about Judge Marchand.
*  What's his approach on the bench?
*  The judge's politics are interesting.
*  So he is a former registered Republican.
*  He's a former prosecutor.
*  He's a law and order guy.
*  He's somebody who believes in the rule of law.
*  And so what we have is a picture of somebody who he is currently a Democrat, as, you
*  know, almost all judges are in New York County.
*  But he is somebody who's I think best described as a moderate.
*  The people we've talked to who know him consider him that way.
*  Now, I should note that Trump and his lawyers have sought to get the judge removed
*  from the case because they claim he has a conflict of interest because his daughter
*  is a Democratic political consultant and that one of her former clients was Vice
*  President Kamala Harris.
*  There's absolutely no reason to suspect that her work had any impact on his
*  handling of this case.
*  And by the way, this is not just me saying this.
*  This is the New York State Judicial Ethics Commission who's ruled on this matter and
*  has determined that the judge does not have a conflict of interest, which is why the
*  judge has now three times rejected Trump's efforts to oust him from the case.
*  OK, so now he's going to be sentenced in November after the election.
*  What's going to happen?
*  Like, what is the potential outcome of this sentencing?
*  Truthfully, we don't know.
*  But a lot of people think that he's not going to serve a single second in jail.
*  There's an argument that he is who he is, his political status and his wealth mean
*  that he's going to wiggle out of this without any real consequences.
*  But I'll just say a lot of our reporting colleagues and I have done suggests that
*  is not a foregone conclusion.
*  There is still very much chance that Donald Trump will serve time for his crimes.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Ben, you said that you think it's possible Trump could actually get jail time.
*  What makes you say that?
*  So just looking at how other cases like his have been resolved, other falsifying
*  business records cases, plenty of people have served jail time and have gone to
*  Rikers Island and have had to serve weeks or months behind bars for this crime.
*  Now, his case does stand alone.
*  There is no other case that we're aware of for falsifying business records to
*  cover up a sex scandal, but there have been plenty of falsifying business records
*  cases and we're able to look at them and we're able to sort of see where these
*  cases go and I will also note that Judge Mershon is not someone to impose easy
*  punishments, including for white collar offenses.
*  And how does Trump's case fit into all of this?
*  Well, he's a first time offender.
*  He's a senior citizen.
*  He's been convicted of a crime that's a nonviolent crime.
*  And so he has many arguments in his favor that he should not be incarcerated.
*  On the other hand, he's also someone who behaved poorly in the judge's courtroom.
*  He was subject to a gag order that he violated repeatedly.
*  And he basically showed pretty broad disdain for the rule of law and the
*  judge's authority.
*  And so when you add those factors in and you add in that he's shown no remorse
*  for his crimes that he's been convicted of, I think you could have a judge who's
*  just had to put up with months of Trump behaving badly in his courtroom to say,
*  you know what?
*  I'm drawing the line here and I'm sentencing this man to time behind bars.
*  And when you say time behind bars, what kind of time are we talking about then?
*  We're probably talking less than a year.
*  We're probably talking weeks or months, and some of it could be part of his
*  probation, but I don't think we're talking a long sentence here.
*  And I don't expect Donald Trump to end up on Rikers Island.
*  I think he's more likely to be in a secure, safe facility with protection
*  from the Secret Service.
*  Okay.
*  So Ben, play this out with me.
*  So the judge is now going to sentence after the election.
*  Let's say Trump wins the election.
*  What happens then?
*  Like, are we talking about, you know, a president-elect serving jail time?
*  I think that's highly unlikely.
*  I think that it's unworkable to have someone who's the president-elect
*  also incarcerated.
*  It would cause all kinds of political chaos.
*  I mean, can you imagine him picking his cabinet while he's behind bars?
*  Right.
*  It would be a real problematic situation.
*  That's true.
*  But I think if he were elected, I think what you would see is a delayed
*  situation where even if he were sentenced on November 26th as planned, the
*  judge would postpone the serving of that sentence until after his second term in
*  office.
*  Again, we've never had to deal with a situation like this.
*  This judge has never had to deal with a situation like this.
*  So we don't know exactly, but I would be stunned if the judge actually made him
*  serve a single second behind bars while he was president-elect.
*  Ben, can he pardon himself?
*  I mean, if he does become president?
*  I think that there's a lot of questions of whether he could pardon himself for the
*  criminal cases he's been charged with federally.
*  I think that in this particular case, which is a state case based out of the
*  Manhattan district attorney's office, there's no way he can pardon himself.
*  This case is beyond the reach of the presidential pardon power because it is
*  brought by a local district attorney's office.
*  Got it.
*  Okay.
*  So there's no way he can pardon himself.
*  What happens if he loses?
*  If he loses the election, he will still try to appeal his conviction and that
*  might delay out, you know, his sentence even further and he may not immediately
*  have to go to jail or anything like that.
*  But it would mean that his sentence would almost certainly be served sooner
*  than if he had won.
*  And so obviously he wants to win because he wants to be president.
*  But one of the potential benefits to him of winning is that it keeps him out of
*  jail.
*  Right.
*  Ben, it's kind of incredible.
*  You know, there've been so many cases against Trump that he's managed to delay
*  for one reason or another, you know, the documents case, the election interference
*  case, but this really seemed like the one that had finally caught up with him.
*  Yet here we are, where even after he was put on trial and found guilty of 34
*  felonies, he still managed to delay the consequences.
*  Exactly.
*  And this was the one case that sort of dented that legal Teflon that he's built
*  over decades, over a half century, to be honest.
*  And all the time that we hear, Oh, Donald Trump is above the law and Donald
*  Trump, the rules don't apply to him.
*  This is why, this is why people feel that once again, he managed to escape some
*  accountability.
*  Now I will say this.
*  He will go into the election as the only former president and potentially
*  future president to be a convicted felon.
*  And that's not nothing.
*  This is a case that Trump tried extensively to get delayed and to get
*  thrown out.
*  And yet it didn't.
*  The jury, a jury of 12 New Yorkers sat in judgment of him and pretty swiftly
*  came back and concluded that he was guilty of the 34 felonies he was accused
*  of, and there's no erasing that.
*  And so I think that while there are these concerns and these laments that
*  Trump is above the law, it's worth remembering that he is also still at the
*  end of the day, a felon.
*  Right.
*  He's still a felon at the end of the day, but how and when he serves his potential
*  time is very much up to voters.
*  It seems right.
*  You know, it seems like a pretty rare thing.
*  Like how many people get a delay on their possible four year sentence based
*  on how many people like them.
*  Exactly.
*  Everything about Donald Trump's legal woes, everything about this case is
*  unique and there's no playbook for something like this.
*  This is why I think it was such a challenging decision for the judge to
*  make.
*  There are no easy decisions in this case whatsoever.
*  Now I understand the concern that any kind of special accommodation for any
*  defendant tarnishes that sense of fairness in the justice system.
*  On the other hand, can you imagine if we had had a sentencing seven weeks before
*  election day, potentially a sentencing to jail time, and if that outcome had
*  moved the polls, had moved the needle in some way, then I think you could have had
*  a judge feel remorse about that to be inserted into the election itself is kind
*  of the opposite of how the justice system is supposed to work.
*  And so I understand everyone's concern, but at the end of the day, this judge was
*  just not going to have himself be a potentially deciding factor in a
*  presidential election.
*  Ben, thank you.
*  Thanks so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  James Earl Jones, whose stage film and television careers spanned Shakespeare's
*  rhapsodic tragedies and the faceless menace of Darth Vader died on Monday.
*  He was 93.
*  Jones was born in Mississippi in 1931.
*  He fell mute for years after developing a debilitating stutter.
*  I have no presumptions or no arrogance about my voice.
*  You know, you want to think that I might even be in love with my voice.
*  I'm not because it would be the most unfaithful lover I ever had because it
*  fails me often.
*  But he learned to speak again and later said that learning to control his stutter
*  had led to his career as an actor.
*  When I first came to the theater, I followed Sydney Poitier's generation, but he
*  had established the hype.
*  And for the rest of us, we were there to establish the breadth of what young black
*  actors could do.
*  He played roles that dealt with racial issues, becoming one of the first black
*  actors to appear regularly on daytime soap operas, acting in the television
*  miniseries Roots and in plays by August Wilson.
*  It is my responsibility.
*  You understand that?
*  A man got to take care of his family.
*  You live in my house.
*  You sleep your behind on my bedclothes.
*  You put my food in your belly because you are my son.
*  You are my flesh and blood.
*  Not because I like you.
*  It is my duty to take care of you.
*  He acted in scores of plays, nearly 90 television dramas and some 120 movies
*  playing kings and generals, garbage men and bricklayers.
*  Simba, you have forgotten me.
*  No, his roles included his voice work, including in the original Star Wars
*  trilogy and in The Lion King.
*  Remember who you are.
*  You are my son and the one true king.
*  Remember who you are.
*  No, please don't leave me.
*  Father.
