# Trump’s Deal Making and Deal Breaking: the Republican Budget and the U.S.–Ukraine Minerals Deal
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=0.0s)]
*  It is Friday, February 28th, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=5.12s)]
*  So friends, welcome back to the roundtable. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=12.92s)]
*  Zolan and Katie, thank you for being in our Washington studio. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=21.68s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=22.68s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=23.68s)]
*  I didn't even say hello to you yet, Maggie. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=24.68s)]
*  Oh, how presumptuous of me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=28.2s)]
*  There's an order to this all. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=32.04s)]
*  I say the host says hello and the guest, you can't just circumvent. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=34.0s)]
*  You okay? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=39.48s)]
*  I hope you all keep this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  That's the plan. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=43.16s)]
*  Ready, Maggie? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=44.16s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=45.16s)]
*  Michael, thank you for having me. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=47.16s)]
*  So this was a week, I would argue, of deal making by President Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=49.66s)]
*  And we are going to spend time on two of those deals. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=54.9s)]
*  And you've all been carefully selected because of your relationship to these deals. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=58.46s)]
*  The first deal was with Congress. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=62.94s)]
*  Maggie, just to start, what was this? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=65.66s)]
*  Trump has been very focused and his aides have been very focused in the White House [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=70.74s)]
*  on trying to get through some kind of a bill through Congress that reflected what he campaigned [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=73.74s)]
*  on. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=79.14s)]
*  So that- [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=80.14s)]
*  Not an executive action, which is pretty much to find this presidency. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=81.14s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=82.82s)]
*  In a number of executive actions, he's very proud of it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=83.82s)]
*  But you can't do everything that way. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=86.5s)]
*  Spending has to get passed through Congress, at least in this form. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=88.74s)]
*  So this House bill was sort of a half man, half horse of Trump's campaign promises. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=92.22s)]
*  That's a very intriguing metaphor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=98.13999999999999s)]
*  Katie, can you explain what this half man, half horse thing was that ends up before Congress? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=99.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=107.46s)]
*  I mean, the campaign promises that Maggie highlighted are really tax cuts. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=108.46s)]
*  It is extending the 2017 tax cuts that his administration passed the first time around. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=113.38s)]
*  And there are a number of other taxes that on the campaign trail he said he wanted to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=118.66s)]
*  eliminate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=122.34s)]
*  But for a lot of House Republicans, they don't want to just cut taxes. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=123.34s)]
*  They also want to cut spending, federal spending. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  That's a huge part of their message. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=130.14s)]
*  It's a huge part of their brand. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=131.14s)]
*  It's a huge part of the Republican Party identity for the last decade. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=132.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=135.94s)]
*  And so a number of these Republicans have said President Trump, we're very happy to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=136.94s)]
*  extend your tax cuts to cut taxes more. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=140.62s)]
*  But we also need to be able to cut federal spending. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=143.42s)]
*  And that is what this budget resolution that they put to a vote on the House floor on Tuesday [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=145.66s)]
*  night laid out the parameters for. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=150.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=153.1s)]
*  And so what happens once this half man, half horse, I'm just going to keep saying that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=154.1s)]
*  as many times as I can, reaches the House floor. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=157.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, this is the balancing act that Speaker Johnson has really had to deal with his entire [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=160.7s)]
*  time as speaker, which is placating basically both the ultra conservatives in his conference [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=166.22s)]
*  and the more moderate Republicans, many of whom represent sort of swing districts. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=171.7s)]
*  And so you heard some concerns from those more centrist Republicans who are saying, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=177.18s)]
*  look, I know this resolution we're about to vote on doesn't say that we're going to cut [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=181.86s)]
*  programs like Medicaid or Medicare, but we're looking at the way this bill has been written. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=186.38s)]
*  And it seems that almost certainly in order to get to the levels of spending cuts we're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  talking about, we're going to have to cut programs like Medicaid. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=196.1s)]
*  And so you had some deep concerns from lawmakers who represent districts where a lot of their [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=200.2s)]
*  constituents rely on Medicaid. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=205.6s)]
*  At the same time, you had these ultra conservatives say, actually, I think this bill doesn't cut [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=208.28s)]
*  spending enough. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  And I'm not sure if I can bring myself to vote for this resolution if it in fact is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=214.42s)]
*  going to increase the deficit. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't think we can let what you just said about Medicare and Medicaid fly by. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=220.52s)]
*  That's a biggie in American politics. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  So whoever wants to take this on, what about this plan seems to many to require touching [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=227.36s)]
*  the third rail of American politics, which is potentially cutting these two huge health [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  programs that millions and millions of Americans rely on? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=242.18s)]
*  I don't want to get us into the weeds too much, but the way a budget resolution is structured, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  lawmakers aren't required to lay out the specific policy changes that they want to make in order [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  to hit these spending targets. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=257.09999999999997s)]
*  But it does instruct individual committees and say, look, you need to go and find X number [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=258.88s)]
*  of dollars of cuts when we build this legislation that we're ultimately going to put to the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=264.44s)]
*  floor for a vote. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=269.76s)]
*  And so in this particular resolution, lawmakers have told the committee that oversees Medicaid [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=271.44s)]
*  and Medicare spending, we need you guys to find in this case, $880 billion in cuts. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=277.08s)]
*  Over 10 years, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=283.44s)]
*  $880 billion over 10 years. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=284.92s)]
*  And there's only so many ways that you can actually reach those cuts. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=287.26s)]
*  And for a program like Medicaid, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=292.52s)]
*  And just as a reminder, this is the program that's a government program providing health [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=294.76s)]
*  insurance for low income Americans. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=299.24s)]
*  So bless you for explaining that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=301.48s)]
*  So that's now a program that could be on the chopping block here in this saga. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=303.12s)]
*  Well, let's talk about how that, to use your word, Zolan's saga unfolds in Congress when [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=307.92s)]
*  the president starts to ask members of his party in Congress to pass this unwieldy thing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  that might require, as you all said, cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  So this was yet again, another vote on the House floor where we really didn't know if [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=324.12s)]
*  Speaker Johnson had the support necessary to push this legislation through. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=328.62s)]
*  He's working with extraordinarily thin margins. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=333.78s)]
*  We saw Democratic leaders actually bring back a number of their lawmakers who have been [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=336.85999999999996s)]
*  ill, who have not been at the Capitol. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  Or who just, I think I saw this, had a baby like a couple of weeks ago. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=344.38s)]
*  A month ago. Yes, a month ago had a baby come back to the Capitol for this vote, trying [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=347.62s)]
*  to ratchet up the pressure. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=351.86s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, as he walked out onto the House floor, said, I have the votes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=353.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, I was texting with a Republican who had said they were going to oppose the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=357.9s)]
*  resolution because it added to the deficit. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=363.06s)]
*  And they said, by my account, there's three of us who are going to oppose it, which would [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=365.9s)]
*  doom it. And it turns out they both were kind of right. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=369.65999999999997s)]
*  Right. Speaker Johnson was able to push this resolution across the finish line in the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=373.02s)]
*  end, but it took about an hour. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=377.7s)]
*  We saw him and some of his deputies really working over about three, four Republican [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  lawmakers who said they didn't want to vote for this resolution because it would add to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=385.9s)]
*  the deficit. It looked for a while like Johnson was not going to be able to get them to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=389.9s)]
*  flip. But then something sort of notable happened, which is that the Republican leadership [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=395.06s)]
*  spirited some of these defectors off the House floor. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=400.26s)]
*  And when that happened, I thought I have seen this movie before, because that is what [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=404.06s)]
*  happened when Johnson was reelected back in January. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=407.73999999999995s)]
*  They took the defectors off the floor and they got a call from President Trump. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  Maggie, is this where you come in? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=415.46000000000004s)]
*  This is where I come in. So one of the potential defectors, Victoria Sparks from Indiana, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=417.18s)]
*  got a call from Trump or spoke to Trump. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=421.94s)]
*  It's not clear to me who initiated the call, but he was really pressuring her, as we [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=423.74s)]
*  understand it, to vote for this bill. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=426.86s)]
*  And at this moment, when the Republican Party is living in Congress, so fearful of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=429.34000000000003s)]
*  Trump, so encroached upon and so and so afraid to go against him in any way. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=436.02s)]
*  And he is making an example of anyone who does. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=441.58000000000004s)]
*  This was a lot of pressure. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=444.06s)]
*  And ultimately, she votes for it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=445.74s)]
*  Right. And it passes 217 to 215 with just one Republican voting against. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=448.46s)]
*  Got it. So it sounds like this pressure works. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=453.74s)]
*  Let's focus for just a second on the question of spending and debt, which would seem to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=456.21999999999997s)]
*  be the thing that these defectors principally were upset about. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=462.78s)]
*  How much is this budget going to increase the U.S. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=468.21999999999997s)]
*  debt? So what House Republicans have given themselves is they've said we are going to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=472.58s)]
*  cut taxes by four point five trillion dollars and then we are going to cut spending by [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=477.38s)]
*  two trillion dollars. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=483.02s)]
*  So essentially, you are looking at a piece of legislation here that is going to add to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=484.29999999999995s)]
*  the deficit by two point five trillion dollars. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=487.94s)]
*  And for a lot of lawmakers, that's a big number. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=490.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And this is where and Zola and Maggie, I'm curious what you think. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  We know where many members of the Republican Party stand on this. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=497.26s)]
*  House Republicans have ousted speakers over failures to rein in spending and be tough [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=501.18s)]
*  enough on the debt. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  And here comes the president kind of bulldozing those who raise that question about [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=509.62s)]
*  spending and debt. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=515.54s)]
*  And that creates a really complicated and I think I'd argue incoherent message about [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=517.4200000000001s)]
*  what the Republican brand is, especially in Congress, but also at the White House. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=522.66s)]
*  Is it the party that cares about deficit and doge and cutting spending and getting rid [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=527.74s)]
*  of people so that we have a smaller government? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=532.06s)]
*  Or is it the party that creates additional debt so that it can cut taxes? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=533.86s)]
*  It's complicated, Michael. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=540.54s)]
*  And I think, look, Republicans have been complaining about debt and the deficit [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=541.94s)]
*  forever. And under Trump's term, certainly it was added to. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=548.5s)]
*  So right. And Trump historically pushes things down the road. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=553.38s)]
*  He kicks the can down the road on what he's going to deal with. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=557.34s)]
*  And that creates a fraught situation, especially for these members who are going to go [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=559.82s)]
*  back to their districts and have to explain all of this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=563.7800000000001s)]
*  Right. While you're cutting spending, the question that we have to keep asking are [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=566.7800000000001s)]
*  going to be following is also what programs get cut with that. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=570.6600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, if you're looking at 800 billion over 10 years, there's very few ways [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=574.3000000000001s)]
*  to do that without cutting something like Medicaid, providing health insurance for [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=580.26s)]
*  lower income Americans. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=584.38s)]
*  Many of which are supporters of the president. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=585.5400000000001s)]
*  Many of which are supporters of the president as well. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=587.38s)]
*  And if they were to do that, you know, Democrats who up until this point have been [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=589.94s)]
*  really cautious in choosing what to swing at when it comes to the Trump administration. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=594.9000000000001s)]
*  They I've talked to folks who say who think they have an opening there and attaching [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  cutting a government program that many of the president's own supporters rely on to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=605.0600000000001s)]
*  this administration. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=609.58s)]
*  Right. In 2018, Democrats were able to coalesce around a message that was focused [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=610.6600000000001s)]
*  on the attempted repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=615.4599999999999s)]
*  Right. And that was an incredibly salient issue. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=619.3s)]
*  And we saw in 2018, Democrats take back the House after campaigning pretty narrowly [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=621.9s)]
*  on that issue. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=627.6999999999999s)]
*  And a lot of Democrats that I've spoken to in the past few days think that they have [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=629.02s)]
*  a real opening to use that playbook again, this time on things like cuts to Medicaid [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=633.66s)]
*  potentially if they happen, if they happen. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=639.38s)]
*  And there's a real excitement and I think energy around that message that, as Zolan [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=642.5s)]
*  pointed out, we haven't seen from Democrats in quite some time. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=646.86s)]
*  Got it. Back then, Republicans touching the Affordable Care Act backfired for them. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=650.02s)]
*  Democrats hope that if they touch Medicaid now, it will backfire once again. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=654.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=658.74s)]
*  We have talked on the show before around this very table about a theoretical deal that [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=660.3s)]
*  Trump had wanted to make with Ukraine that would require Ukraine to basically [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=666.34s)]
*  compensate the U.S. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=671.54s)]
*  for all the military assistance that the U.S. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=672.6999999999999s)]
*  has given Ukraine in this war against Russia. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=676.06s)]
*  It started off as very theoretical and notional, but now it's becoming an actual reality. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=678.42s)]
*  And Ukraine's leader, Vladimir Zelensky, is now headed to Washington to make it official [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=682.74s)]
*  on Friday. Zolan, how did this all start and become what it now is? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=688.78s)]
*  So we've talked about how President Trump's approach to foreign policy can best be [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=693.98s)]
*  described as transactional. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=698.38s)]
*  And we got some examples of that early on when [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=700.42s)]
*  after coming into office, you know, when it came to aid for Ukraine, it started out as [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=706.1800000000001s)]
*  sort of amusing over having an exchange of the natural resources in Ukraine [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=711.02s)]
*  for aid to Ukraine. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=718.1800000000001s)]
*  And that has really become a focus of the negotiations that we've now seen in recent [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=720.62s)]
*  days and in recent weeks. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=725.1s)]
*  So a pivotal point in this is when Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson, took a [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=726.7800000000001s)]
*  trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, and presented an initial version of this deal. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=731.7s)]
*  And the initial version, Ukraine balked at it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=738.14s)]
*  What was the initial version? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=742.34s)]
*  Sure. First, the U.S. basically wants back pay for the aid they already sent to Ukraine. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=743.9000000000001s)]
*  Trump is basically saying, you have these critical earth minerals in Ukraine and the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=750.1s)]
*  U.S. is going to get a significant amount, half of the revenue from that up to 500 [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=755.58s)]
*  billion. It's a lot. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=759.6600000000001s)]
*  The maybe even more significant thing is what's not in that proposal. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=761.34s)]
*  And that's the assurance Zelensky wants of a long term security guarantee. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=765.6600000000001s)]
*  The concern for Ukraine is that any pause in fighting that U.S. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=771.82s)]
*  and Russia agreed to. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=776.38s)]
*  Well, what if Russia uses that to build up its forces and then Ukraine is left [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=777.7800000000001s)]
*  without the assurance, the knowledge that the United States will come to their defense, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=783.18s)]
*  that the United States will actually support Ukraine. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=787.14s)]
*  And it would be left without some rare earth minerals that would help it pay for its own [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=789.3s)]
*  defense if it were to accept this deal. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=793.78s)]
*  Maggie, how should we understand this initial offer that on its face seems like a very [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=795.7399999999999s)]
*  good deal for the U.S. and not much of a deal at all for Ukraine? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=801.8599999999999s)]
*  I think you just answered your own question. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=805.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, essentially, Trump has separated out Russia and Ukraine from one another as he [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=806.54s)]
*  is saying that he is trying to negotiate a peace deal. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=811.54s)]
*  He's got Russia at one table with the U.S. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=814.06s)]
*  He's got Ukraine at another table with the U.S. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=816.14s)]
*  A smaller table. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=818.18s)]
*  A much smaller table. And with Ukraine, with, you know, Trump said it himself. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=818.74s)]
*  And it's really true. Ukraine basically has no cards to play. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=822.42s)]
*  Trump has rejected the idea of NATO membership for Ukraine. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=825.2199999999999s)]
*  And Trump also does not want to provide security guarantees for Ukraine. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=828.62s)]
*  He wants Europe to do it. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=832.78s)]
*  And that is going to require a heave of the will by Europeans. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=834.26s)]
*  And we'll see what that looks like. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=837.6999999999999s)]
*  So the new deal that is being negotiated. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=839.38s)]
*  Because the first one kind of got rejected. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=842.34s)]
*  First one was rejected and then other iterations of it were rejected. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=843.78s)]
*  And then and then the Commerce Secretary, Harold Lutnick, jumped in and that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=846.54s)]
*  complicated. Yeah. How do we get to a deal? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=850.02s)]
*  So what is now there because of various forces is a smaller deal in terms of what [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=851.4599999999999s)]
*  the U.S. will get. Trump keeps saying 350 billion. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=857.98s)]
*  My understanding is the actual number is smaller than that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=860.6999999999999s)]
*  But it still does not include a security piece. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=863.74s)]
*  And that was clearly a red line for Trump. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=867.06s)]
*  And Zelensky clearly realizes that and is taking what he can get. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=869.18s)]
*  But that doesn't seem like a deal the president of Ukraine would sign. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=872.8199999999999s)]
*  And yet, he's about to arrive in Washington and sign it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=876.5799999999999s)]
*  Why? Well, for one, I mean, a late version of a U.S. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=879.3s)]
*  proposal did vaguely say that the U.S. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=883.5s)]
*  would support Ukraine's security. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=887.5s)]
*  But then Trump came around the next day in a cabinet meeting and said, essentially, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=890.74s)]
*  that was going to be the responsibility of European nations that are closer to [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=894.18s)]
*  Ukraine. Zelensky is in a really tight spot here, too. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=897.86s)]
*  I mean, he he knows Ukraine has been relying on a lot of USAID. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=902.9s)]
*  And, you know, he's now put in a position where, like many other world leaders, he [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=908.54s)]
*  now needs to come to Washington and try to placate Trump, try to use old-fashioned [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=913.02s)]
*  diplomacy to try and secure any kind of assurance for Ukraine. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=920.18s)]
*  Katie, is this the death, like the official death of anything [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=924.6999999999999s)]
*  resembling the conventional Republican approach [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=930.18s)]
*  to Russia and containing its territorial aggression and its previous [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=935.7399999999999s)]
*  mandate to protect Ukraine? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=942.3399999999999s)]
*  Over the past seven years, I've been up on the Hill. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=944.06s)]
*  I've written a lot about sort of the two foreign policy wings of the Republican [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=946.1s)]
*  Party, sort of the traditional Mitch McConnell, the Ukrainian right wing [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=950.46s)]
*  and sort of the at the time ascendant sort of they call themselves realists, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=956.78s)]
*  restrainers, people who did not want to send sort of U.S. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=961.82s)]
*  treasure, U.S. troops abroad. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=965.5s)]
*  And I think what we've seen over the past couple of weeks, at least when it comes [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=967.9s)]
*  to Republicans in Congress, is that that's not really a battle anymore. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=971.86s)]
*  And it's over. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=976.14s)]
*  The anti-interventionists have won. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=977.46s)]
*  They occupy positions of power in Republican leadership on the Hill. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=979.58s)]
*  They occupy positions of power within the Pentagon. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=983.86s)]
*  And so I think Zelensky knows that, right? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=987.1s)]
*  He knows that he's not going to get any more aid from Congress. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=989.7s)]
*  And so he has to make a deal with President Trump. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=992.9s)]
*  Well, to that point, if you subscribe to this ascendant, now victorious [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=995.86s)]
*  America first worldview that has now dominated the party under Trump. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=999.74s)]
*  Isn't this quite an achievement? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1005.7800000000001s)]
*  The United States is going to recoup the money it's spent in Ukraine with no [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1009.5s)]
*  commitment to spend much more or to ever put American troops in harm's way in [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1014.94s)]
*  Ukraine in a war that Trump and many Republicans don't think the U.S. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1020.58s)]
*  has a real interest in. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1023.98s)]
*  Yes, I mean, this is look, you know, in a long line of things that Donald Trump [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1025.8600000000001s)]
*  promised during the campaign and is doing, this is one he made very clear that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1030.66s)]
*  he did not support the aid to Ukraine. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1036.3000000000002s)]
*  Trump also looks at all of these engagements through an economic lens. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1039.8600000000001s)]
*  He does not look at him through a foreign policy and the same way, you know, as [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1043.8200000000002s)]
*  some kind of a moral exercise. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1047.7800000000002s)]
*  He is looking at it as what is the best deal for the U.S. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1049.1000000000001s)]
*  He sees Ukraine as a tiny country. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1052.22s)]
*  Russia is obviously not the superpower it once was, but in Trump's mind, it [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1054.94s)]
*  looms much larger from its stature decades ago. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1058.98s)]
*  And he sees more business opportunities for the country, as he has said, with [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1063.46s)]
*  Russia than he does with Ukraine. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1068.8200000000002s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1070.66s)]
*  Even when the administration is trying to reassure Ukraine that the United States [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1071.22s)]
*  will be here, they actually point to the fact that, look, if we have an investment [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1074.6200000000001s)]
*  in your critical earth minerals, that is in a form, you know, the best kind of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1080.22s)]
*  security assurance that you could get because we don't want Russia to take [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1085.78s)]
*  over all of this territory. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1089.78s)]
*  If we have an agreement with you to continue to financially benefit, you know, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1091.02s)]
*  from these critical earth minerals, isn't it more likely that we will continue to [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1095.58s)]
*  support your defense of your land, which I think says a lot about Trump? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1099.58s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1103.82s)]
*  It says a lot about him. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1104.66s)]
*  The best way to get America's support is to allow us to have a financial interest [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1106.62s)]
*  in you not being overrun by your larger neighbor, which in this case, he's just [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1111.42s)]
*  struck. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1115.46s)]
*  It's also worth noting just some of the criticism that's come from some other [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1115.94s)]
*  European leaders who have said that this does echo colonialism as well, right? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1120.82s)]
*  And a colonialist approach where you are looking to extract the resources of a [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1126.26s)]
*  country that you have leverage over or even power over. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1132.58s)]
*  I just want to end by asking for a larger reflection on all this deal making. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1136.34s)]
*  We started, of course, in Congress. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1141.54s)]
*  Now we've gotten to this deal with Ukraine. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1143.46s)]
*  But if you zoom out even further and you think about all the Trump deals that have [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1145.46s)]
*  been struck since he was inaugurated, you've got to deal with Canada on tariffs. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1150.1399999999999s)]
*  You got to deal with Mexico on tariffs. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1153.98s)]
*  On top of that, the prime minister of the UK was just at the White House offering [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1157.22s)]
*  Trump a deal of his own to increase the UK's defense spending, something that as [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1161.46s)]
*  we've hinted at here, Trump has asked all European countries to do so that they are [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1166.8200000000002s)]
*  less reliant on United States defense spending. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1171.2600000000002s)]
*  And when you think about it, the common thread here is Trump's allies. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1175.14s)]
*  And stay with me, this is one of those heady stretch ending questions. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1182.2600000000002s)]
*  His allies both within his party and America's allies across the world are all [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1186.8600000000001s)]
*  kind of bending to him in ways that don't seem to hew to tradition or in some cases [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1194.34s)]
*  to their own best interests. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1201.6200000000001s)]
*  And just to give you a vivid example of that knee bending right before we started [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1203.54s)]
*  taping, the prime minister of the UK handed Donald Trump a letter from King Charles. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1207.74s)]
*  I want to play you that scene. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1214.74s)]
*  This is a letter from his majesty, the king. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1216.98s)]
*  It's an invitation for a second state visit. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1220.1799999999998s)]
*  This is really special. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1225.3s)]
*  This has never happened before. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1226.54s)]
*  This is unprecedented. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1228.22s)]
*  And I think that just symbolizes the strength of the relationship between us. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1230.8999999999999s)]
*  So this is a very special letter. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1236.34s)]
*  I think the last state visit was a tremendous success. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1238.9399999999998s)]
*  His majesty, the king, wants to make this even better than that. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1242.26s)]
*  So this is this is truly historic. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1245.82s)]
*  I mean, just to really summarize what has happened in this scene, the prime minister [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1249.7s)]
*  of the United Kingdom, having basically been summoned to Washington to make sure [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1255.14s)]
*  that Trump knows that he's willing to have less U.S. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1262.3s)]
*  security in Europe and instead that the UK will spend more on its own security [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1266.14s)]
*  follows up by saying, oh, and by the way, our king wants to have you for dinner. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1271.02s)]
*  It's going to be amazing. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1275.74s)]
*  It's going to be historic. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1276.78s)]
*  The scene is one of kind of, let's just put it really plainly, self debasement in [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1278.74s)]
*  the name of impressing Donald Trump. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1287.5s)]
*  There was a whole sideshow in the first term when Trump visited the UK and met [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1291.26s)]
*  with the royal family. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1298.26s)]
*  And there were all these complaints about how he handled himself and some concerns [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1299.58s)]
*  by people around the royals that they didn't care for how the Trump entourage was [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1303.02s)]
*  behaving and so forth. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1307.58s)]
*  And that was all very much on the UK's terms. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1308.34s)]
*  This is all on Donald Trump's terms and using the British royal family, which Trump [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1311.02s)]
*  has been enchanted by since childhood, and he credits his mother for that as a [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1315.66s)]
*  chit. And so this is absolutely a change in tone and a change in approach. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1320.42s)]
*  And it is definitely a bending of the knee of some sorts, but it is also a [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1325.5s)]
*  reflection of how world leaders have instead of bristling against Trump trying [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1330.38s)]
*  to set the debate on his own terms are just essentially saying hell with it at [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1335.78s)]
*  this point. And that's pretty different than the first term. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1340.3400000000001s)]
*  This is a recognition that Trump wants some kind of offering. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1342.42s)]
*  And this one is pretty clever. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1346.6200000000001s)]
*  I think we all might have imagined that Trump's victory in the U.S. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1348.74s)]
*  meant that there would be lots of dealmaking from within the Republican Party [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1352.46s)]
*  and concessions. But this is something else entirely. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1357.3400000000001s)]
*  These are America's strongest allies saying, where do you need me? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1360.42s)]
*  What do you want? Here's the deal. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1365.8200000000002s)]
*  And it's just very striking what an extraordinary exercise of power we're seeing [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1368.74s)]
*  from this president. I think that's right. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1375.1000000000001s)]
*  And it's a little bit of what have you done for me lately approach to foreign [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1377.18s)]
*  policy. And you're seeing other nations react in a way to try and give him [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1381.8999999999999s)]
*  something that he can cite that they've done for him lately. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1385.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's not just today. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1389.1399999999999s)]
*  The Japanese prime minister came to the White House and was showering Trump with [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1390.9399999999998s)]
*  compliments, complementing his appearance on TV. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1394.9799999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu also showered him with compliments when he threatened tariffs [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1399.26s)]
*  against Mexico. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1402.5s)]
*  Mexico agreed to new border security measures. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1403.78s)]
*  You saw Canada also threatened with tariffs and talked about, you know, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1409.38s)]
*  different things they were going to do at their northern border. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1414.34s)]
*  You're seeing Trump make clear what his approach to foreign policy is. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1417.42s)]
*  And you're seeing other world leaders respond by giving him something, whether [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1420.94s)]
*  it be something tangible on the ground or something like minerals or simply even [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1425.94s)]
*  the appearance of placating at the White House. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1430.7s)]
*  Right. And that can be minerals, literally something from the ground or it can be [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1433.54s)]
*  dinner with the king. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1436.34s)]
*  One of them is probably more specific to the U.S. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1438.54s)]
*  economy than the other. But yes. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1441.78s)]
*  Well, my thanks to all three of you, Maggie, Zolan, Katie. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1443.4199999999998s)]
*  See you again soon. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1447.3799999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Michael. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hwqCMy1Rpw&t=1448.98s)]
