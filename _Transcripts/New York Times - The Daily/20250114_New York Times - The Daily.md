# Could the L.A. Fires Have Been Stopped Sooner?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=0.0s)]
*  As wildfires ravage Southern California for a seventh straight day, residents are seeking [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  answers about why so much has been lost, and whether their government could have done more [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=16.3s)]
*  to protect them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=21.68s)]

*  I'm right here! [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Need a little water! [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  In the days since the fires started, a bleak picture has emerged of the extent of the damage [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=65.4s)]
*  they caused. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  My family and I just lost our home here that we grew up in. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  It's very, very hard. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=78.08s)]
*  It's hard not to cry. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=79.68s)]
*  As you can see, there's nothing left, and I've been here for about an hour and a half, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  and I don't want to leave this home. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  I'm like, man, how much can one guy take? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  People tell me to be strong, it's like how much stronger do I have to be? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  These fires are on pace to be the most destructive in California's history. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  In the Palisades, on the west side of Los Angeles, an out-of-control fire ripped through [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=100.46s)]
*  homes and historic landmarks. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=104.88s)]
*  Near the eastern edge of the city, entire neighborhoods in Altadena were reduced to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=110.2s)]
*  ashes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=114.44s)]
*  As rescuers combed through the rubble, they found the body of a man named Victor Shaw. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=116.62s)]
*  He was laying dead in his front yard, clutching a garden hose. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  I couldn't be here to save him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=125.48s)]
*  I couldn't be here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  That's what hurts the most. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  I couldn't be here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=130.96s)]
*  Throughout the week, intense winds fueled new fires. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=136.96s)]
*  There were more and more haunting images. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=140.56s)]
*  There were roads full of charred cars, embers falling from the sky onto scorched palm trees, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=143.44s)]
*  hollowed out houses. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  And even though the fires were still burning, residents who had evacuated to safety began [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=151.0s)]
*  to return, to survey what was lost. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=155.56s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=159.12s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=162.12s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=166.12s)]
*  No. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=171.12s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=174.12s)]
*  My colleague, Emily Baumgartner-Nunn, was driving up a street in the Palisades when [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=187.52s)]
*  she saw a woman named Nas Sykes hiking up a canyon with her husband, Steve. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=192.6s)]
*  Can you take us to your street and sort of what it was like walking down the street to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=197.0s)]
*  your own home? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=203.16s)]
*  I mean, so, you know, Steve was ahead of me. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=205.48s)]
*  He was like, I'm just going to run. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=208.94s)]
*  He's like, I can't, you know, I need to see. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  I need to see. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=212.8s)]
*  So he's ahead of me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=213.8s)]
*  We turned a corner and I see smoke and I'm thinking maybe our house is fine because there's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=215.6s)]
*  like a little smoke coming. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=220.56s)]
*  And he's ahead of me and he's running. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=222.52s)]
*  And the next thing I know, he stops and he's just emotional. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=225.9s)]
*  You know, he is, he's holding his head. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=230.2s)]
*  And so then I knew it was gone. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=233.08s)]
*  I was almost like an out of body experience. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  So many little pieces of our identity to see it in ashes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=245.36s)]
*  My first thought was, how am I going to explain to my children? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=250.22s)]
*  Because I can't even understand what I'm seeing in front of me right now. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=256.1s)]
*  How is this possible? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=262.14s)]
*  And in such a short amount of time, I mean, literally less than 24 hours from the time [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=264.06s)]
*  that we had left, an entire town was burnt. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=270.14s)]
*  What do you think you'll miss most about your old home? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=280.16s)]
*  I will miss every time I opened my door and I walked in and the way the sun would shine [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=285.38s)]
*  into the room, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=293.18s)]
*  When you walked in and I would have my little flowers from Trader Joe's on it, they'd put [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  my vase and try to make the house look pretty for the girls and looking at their little [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=298.64000000000004s)]
*  rooms every day, making their bed every day as I would make the bed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=304.32000000000005s)]
*  I literally would thank God and say, thank you for giving them this space. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=309.9s)]
*  It was almost like I had proved something to myself that I can do this and I can do [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=317.38s)]
*  it for my kids. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=321.58s)]
*  That I was able to give it to them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=324.53999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you, do you ever find yourself just wondering who could have prevented this? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=335.32s)]
*  Are you angry? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=341.02s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=343.92s)]
*  I am angry. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=344.92s)]
*  I'm angry because there was no surprise to this. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=345.92s)]
*  They knew that this weather system is coming in. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=349.94s)]
*  They knew that things are dry. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  We haven't had any rain, but it seems like nobody was proactively taking care of anything. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=354.36s)]
*  Given the number of fire trucks, you would expect more. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=362.0s)]
*  Or a number of planes dropping water, you would expect more. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=367.24s)]
*  And if we can't have planes, then what's the other option? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=371.52s)]
*  Even the most basic is, do we have water? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=375.36s)]
*  It's not the fire department's fault. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=380.88s)]
*  It's not the police officers. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=383.8s)]
*  They're doing what they need to do. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=385.64s)]
*  How can a place like Los Angeles, Pacific Palisades, the amount of money, the amount [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  of resources, the amount of taxes that we pay, you run out of water? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=396.2s)]
*  Definitely nobody was prepared for this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=403.32s)]
*  And I think that it didn't need to go to the extent that it did. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=406.0s)]
*  I think 50% of the loss could have been prevented. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=409.72s)]
*  Mike, we've seen this outburst among residents in LA of frustration and anger over the government's [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=431.88000000000005s)]
*  response to these fires. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=438.68s)]
*  And there's been a lot of speculation about whether more could have been done. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=440.16s)]
*  Take me through what happened with the efforts to contain the fires. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, so the day before the fire, we're starting to see forecasts from the National Weather [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=448.44s)]
*  Service of a particularly dangerous scenario, how the winds would be gusting up to potentially [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=453.04s)]
*  100 miles an hour, where any spark could spread into a catastrophic fire. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  It's also the classic fire danger scenario for Los Angeles. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=466.04s)]
*  The city knows the situation. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=470.68s)]
*  They know how to prepare for that kind of circumstance. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=472.16s)]
*  And so they did. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=475.44s)]
*  They started to refill water tanks all over the city, the water tanks that are a supply [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=476.76s)]
*  for higher elevation neighborhoods. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=482.72s)]
*  They start pre-positioning trucks in vulnerable areas. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=485.44s)]
*  They've got firefighters deploying. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=488.92s)]
*  They've got extra engines coming in. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=490.88s)]
*  They're calling up people who are off duty. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  The Forest Service is getting involved, and there's trucks and bulldozers and helicopters [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=496.03999999999996s)]
*  and airplanes all getting sort of ready in case something happens. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=501.0s)]
*  So they're actively trying to guess, it sounds like, where the most vulnerable places are, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=505.64s)]
*  and they're surging firefighters, water resources to those areas. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the fire department's looking at past wind events, where fires normally take place [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=516.04s)]
*  and they're looking at the forecast for the day and sort of making their own educated [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=522.68s)]
*  guess about where the best spot will be for them to place their assets. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=527.2399999999999s)]
*  But of note, none of the extra trucks went to Pacific Palisades. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=533.0s)]
*  At this point, do we know how the Palisades fire started? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  We don't. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=541.0s)]
*  We've been spending some time the last few days up there examining satellite images, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=542.0s)]
*  collecting images and videos from neighbors who saw the start. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=547.3599999999999s)]
*  They have a pretty good idea exactly where it began, but even being up there, there's [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=551.88s)]
*  a lot of clues on the ground that could suggest a few different things that could have taken place. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=556.84s)]
*  Like what, for example? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=561.68s)]
*  In that exact area, there was a fire about a week prior, started on New Year's Day, that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=563.16s)]
*  had been put out, but there's lingering questions of whether maybe embers deep in the ground [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=568.84s)]
*  had sort of sustained and survived from that fire and then reemerged when the winds kicked up. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=574.28s)]
*  There's remnants of power line materials up there that don't seem to be connected to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=579.8s)]
*  any active power lines, but were there on the ground near the origin of the fire. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=585.68s)]
*  And then it's along a trail that's a popular one for people to come climb and hike and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=591.24s)]
*  be around. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=597.0s)]
*  And there were people up there that day, that morning, and something they had done purposely [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=598.0s)]
*  or not could have contributed to the fire starting. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=603.3199999999999s)]
*  It sounds like there's a lot of theories, but as of now, we don't really know the origin [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=606.16s)]
*  of this thing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  But once it gets going, what happens? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=611.4s)]
*  So it's around 1030 a.m. that the first report of fire comes in, and it's in the Palisades. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=615.12s)]
*  Residents start seeing flames emerging out in the dry brush land, and it immediately [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  starts racing down the hillside toward the ocean. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=631.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's moving fast right from the beginning. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=636.56s)]
*  We've listened to the dispatch audio from firefighters who are rushing to the scene [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  that they can see that it's moving quickly and headed right toward the Palisades. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=644.8s)]
*  You can hear one of them warning that it could be getting towards homes within minutes. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=649.0s)]
*  And that it looks like it's going to have a good run ahead of it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=658.92s)]
*  And you can tell immediately this is a pretty dire situation. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=666.04s)]
*  And at the same time, the conditions are getting worse. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=670.84s)]
*  The wind is picking up, smoke is choking the air, the fire is moving quickly, there's frantic [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=674.16s)]
*  evacuations that are blocking one road as the road gets clogged up. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=679.72s)]
*  One fire captain says he can't see more than 10 feet in front of his own rig. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=684.32s)]
*  And as these winds keep getting worse as the day progresses, the firefighters start losing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=689.5200000000001s)]
*  one of their key tools. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=694.6s)]
*  They're no longer able to use those aerial assets, the helicopters and the planes that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=696.0s)]
*  pick up water and drop it on the fire and also spread fire retardant to prevent the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=701.32s)]
*  fire from spreading further. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=706.6600000000001s)]
*  And then we get the word that things are even worse. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=714.88s)]
*  There's another fire 25 miles away, threatening a different part of the Los Angeles area. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=717.88s)]
*  The Eden Fire. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=725.8000000000001s)]
*  So the Eden Fire begins in the hills around the Altadena area and immediately it's starting [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=728.5600000000001s)]
*  to threaten neighborhoods nearby. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=734.6s)]
*  Firefighters are once again scrambling, trying to get assets there. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=736.9200000000001s)]
*  One fire chief talks about driving there actually from the palisades. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=742.0s)]
*  He plugs it into his GPS, he's stuck in this bumper to bumper traffic, he watches as this [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=745.9599999999999s)]
*  new fire he's trying to get to starts filling the sky. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=752.4s)]
*  That fire chief, he eventually calls the California Office of Emergency Services and says, essentially, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=756.92s)]
*  we are out of resources and need more help. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  He asked for 50 strike teams, a total of 250 more fire engines and 1,000 more firefighters. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=767.16s)]
*  And even as he's putting in this request, there's really more trouble brewing. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=776.88s)]
*  Soon we get word that there's a third fire up in the San Fernando Valley. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=783.92s)]
*  They're really beyond their max capacity and it keeps getting worse. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=789.16s)]
*  The fire in the palisades is spreading ever further. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=797.8s)]
*  More homes are going up into flames. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  And then late into the night, this one fire captain talks about how their fire hoses start [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=803.68s)]
*  sputtering and then go dry and they try a new hydrant, still dry, try another hydrant, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=810.28s)]
*  still no water. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=816.16s)]
*  There's no water left for them to keep fighting the fire. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=817.16s)]
*  We've been really spending a lot of time trying to understand exactly what went wrong here. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=822.16s)]
*  We talked a little earlier about the city had filled a bunch of storage tanks all around [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=829.16s)]
*  neighborhoods that are high up in these hillsides and that included the palisades where there [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=835.8s)]
*  are three million gallon storage tanks designed to fill the system with water, designed to [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=840.0s)]
*  support not only homes and their water lines, but also the fire hydrants below. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=847.76s)]
*  And what we've learned is that the city could not fill them up to keep pace with how much [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=853.88s)]
*  water was being used. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=858.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=860.76s)]
*  What the city has basically said, there's so much water being funneled out of this system. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=864.56s)]
*  You have residents that are sort of spraying their own properties trying to stop any embers [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=869.48s)]
*  from taking hold. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=875.0s)]
*  You have the mega rich who are contracting their own private firefighters to protect [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=876.04s)]
*  their own properties. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  At the same time, you have all these firefighters tapping numerous hydrants all at once. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=881.9599999999999s)]
*  Frankly, this is not what the system is designed to handle. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=888.4399999999999s)]
*  Municipal water systems like this are really designed for small fires, handling blazes [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=893.12s)]
*  that might consume a few homes, not one that is consuming a few hundred all at once. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=900.08s)]
*  So they depleted three million gallons of water, which to me sounds like a lot, but [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=906.48s)]
*  was there more that they could have or should have had access to? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=911.88s)]
*  Yeah, it turns out one of the reservoirs, the one actually located in the palisades [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=915.56s)]
*  was down for maintenance. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=920.88s)]
*  No water available at that point to feed the system and to also help push water up into [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=922.78s)]
*  the storage tanks that turned out to be depleted sort of within hours after the fire began. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=929.36s)]
*  So critical reserves unavailable at perhaps the most critical moment. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=936.16s)]
*  How big of a deal do you think that is? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=941.32s)]
*  Certainly to the firefighters that were there watching their hoses go dry, there was a lot [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=943.92s)]
*  of frustration, a feeling of desperation, a feeling of helplessness that they couldn't [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=948.28s)]
*  really do the work that they're in position to do. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  Certainly having those resources could have at least helped to some degree, but I think [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=956.68s)]
*  there's a lingering question about whether it could have turned the tide of a fire that [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=960.92s)]
*  had already grown so large. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=966.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it seems like there is a fair question to ask about why it was offline for [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  maintenance when the fire risk was so high. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's definitely one of the questions I've been asking. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=976.1999999999999s)]
*  In some ways, it's offline for maintenance in the winter and these things need repairs [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=979.52s)]
*  and winter is normally a good time to make that happen. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=984.0s)]
*  But I keep wondering, was there an opportunity here to bring it back online, especially when [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=987.68s)]
*  the weather forecast was predicting a scenario that could turn disastrous? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=995.7199999999999s)]
*  Mike, we've talked about two real issues in terms of preparedness. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1001.52s)]
*  One is the number of firefighting resources available and the other is the amount of water [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1006.4799999999999s)]
*  available. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1011.14s)]
*  Both came up short. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1012.88s)]
*  There's now been a pretty robust debate about whether the city government did enough to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1015.32s)]
*  get ready for these fires. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1019.2s)]
*  What are the firefighters themselves saying? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1021.72s)]
*  Yeah, we're hearing from firefighters that they felt they did everything they could with [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1023.76s)]
*  the resources they had. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1029.0s)]
*  And we're back with breaking news. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1030.8s)]
*  The Los Angeles city fire chief said that the city failed her and the fire department [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1031.92s)]
*  in the response to the deadly wildfires. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1036.68s)]
*  Fire chief Christian Crowley said there were not enough resources. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1038.24s)]
*  I want to be very, very clear. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1041.8s)]
*  Yes, we took a 17 million dollar budget cut. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1043.32s)]
*  And as we know, any budget cut would negatively impact our ability to carry out our mission. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1047.08s)]
*  That cuts to her budget made last year definitely had some negative impacts for her crews. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1053.8s)]
*  And I warned, I rang the bell that these additional cuts could be very, very devastating for our [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1059.9s)]
*  ability to provide public safety. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1066.24s)]
*  That would have... [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1068.64s)]
*  I mean, and this is something she had been talking about for months, even before the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1069.8000000000002s)]
*  fires. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1073.48s)]
*  Crowley had felt that her department did not have enough resources. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1074.48s)]
*  She said cuts that were made last year to overtime created unprecedented operational [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1078.2s)]
*  challenges for the department and has sort of repeated that now in the aftermath of the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1085.0s)]
*  fire. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1090.8400000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the other hand... [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1091.8400000000001s)]
*  Can you address the criticism now over the budget issue and the slashing, the 17 million [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1093.4s)]
*  dollar slashing? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1098.2800000000002s)]
*  The mayor is saying that those budget cuts didn't have an impact on the response to this [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1100.24s)]
*  event. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1106.72s)]
*  There were no reductions that were made that would have impacted the situation that we [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1107.72s)]
*  were dealing with over the last couple of days. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1112.72s)]
*  And then there was a little bit... [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1115.56s)]
*  So you have the fire chief saying this was a real issue, the funding, and you have the [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1117.48s)]
*  mayor saying this wouldn't have made a difference. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1123.04s)]
*  What's the truth here? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1126.72s)]
*  I think from talking to people throughout Los Angeles this past week, there's a general [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1128.1200000000001s)]
*  sense that of course more resources would have been helpful. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1133.2s)]
*  People would have been grateful for it. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1137.24s)]
*  It probably could have saved homes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1138.24s)]
*  Maybe it could have even saved lives. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1139.76s)]
*  But it also seems likely that given the scale of this disaster, a few million more dollars, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1144.2s)]
*  some more firefighters, you know, it maybe only could have helped around the margins. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1150.8s)]
*  It seems these fires were bound to overwhelm a system that wasn't designed to handle them. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1156.12s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1167.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1169.12s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1178.96s)]
*  Chris, we just heard from our colleague Mike Baker that LA could have used more water and [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1187.08s)]
*  more firefighters, but that even if it had those things, controlling these fires would [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1191.8799999999999s)]
*  have been really, really hard. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1196.32s)]
*  You're a climate reporter for The Times. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1198.9199999999998s)]
*  Help me understand what that means about our ability to respond to wildfires just across [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1201.36s)]
*  the US. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1207.6799999999998s)]
*  The first thing that's really important to make clear is climate change makes this all [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1209.68s)]
*  harder. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1215.92s)]
*  The combination of rising temperatures and longer droughts mean you've got more vegetation [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1217.0800000000002s)]
*  ready to burn. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  You've got hotter temperatures make it easier for that vegetation to burn. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1224.44s)]
*  You've got even more of a challenge putting it out. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1228.92s)]
*  This is fundamentally a climate story. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1231.76s)]
*  But if any state is prepared for these things, it's California. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1235.68s)]
*  They've done all the things that you'd want a state government to do to get ready for [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1240.4s)]
*  those climate risks. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1245.5600000000002s)]
*  And still, it didn't really work. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1246.92s)]
*  Okay, tell me why California, at least in theory, is the state that should be most prepared [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1249.3200000000002s)]
*  for fires like this. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1254.44s)]
*  Yeah, the first thing to know about California is they've had wildfires throughout their [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1256.0s)]
*  including some really devastating blazes, not least the disastrous fires in 2017 and [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1261.24s)]
*  2018. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1267.84s)]
*  So first of all, this is a state that knows fire is a part of the landscape. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1268.84s)]
*  But also there's this question of vulnerability. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1273.8s)]
*  California is painfully exposed to wildfires because of the physical nature of the state. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1276.8s)]
*  The risk in Los Angeles is high for a bunch of reasons. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1284.04s)]
*  One is it's a desert, you get very little rainfall, so you get dry terrain that can [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1287.24s)]
*  burn easily. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1292.84s)]
*  But also the topography, right? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1294.4s)]
*  The hills around Los Angeles are sort of a delight. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1296.08s)]
*  You get to live somewhere with a view, you get a wonderful breeze, which is nice in a [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1300.6200000000001s)]
*  desert, but you also get really high fire risk. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1306.2s)]
*  Firefighters can move quickly up hills, it's harder for firefighters to access those homes. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1310.28s)]
*  As we saw with the fire hydrants, harder to move water up the hills. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1317.36s)]
*  So we're sort of now realizing that these neighborhoods in Los Angeles that seem like [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1320.84s)]
*  wonderful places to live, like Pacific Palisades, like the Hollywood Hills, have a really high [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1325.48s)]
*  risk. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1330.8799999999999s)]
*  And also you've got these Santa Ana winds. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1332.3999999999999s)]
*  The Santa Ana winds, as we've all learned to devastating effect, can push hot, dry air [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1335.6399999999999s)]
*  at huge speeds, which is catnip for fires. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1343.02s)]
*  Then the vegetation, this vegetation is meant to burn. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1347.4199999999998s)]
*  You get a long drought coupled with, in our case, a huge burst vegetation after last year's [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1351.28s)]
*  rain and snow, you get sort of the ideal conditions for wildfires that grow quickly, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1357.96s)]
*  spread fast, and are hard to put out. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1366.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1369.44s)]
*  I mean, these are conditions that are just kind of baked into the place. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1370.44s)]
*  It's been this way forever. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1373.76s)]
*  We've talked about this on the show. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1375.64s)]
*  These things make fires like this almost foreseeable. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  So how has California prepared given that? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1382.1200000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1385.28s)]
*  That's right. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1386.52s)]
*  They're not just foreseeable. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1387.52s)]
*  They're almost guaranteed to happen. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1388.52s)]
*  And as a result, California has been pretty thorough at setting up a system of prevention [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1389.92s)]
*  and toughening that can make these fires, in theory, more manageable. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1396.48s)]
*  Start with their building code. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1402.84s)]
*  California has one of the best building codes in the country for how to build homes in fire-prone [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1403.84s)]
*  areas so that they're less likely to burn. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1409.96s)]
*  That means using materials that are less likely to catch fire. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1413.26s)]
*  So stucco or concrete, steel roofs, not having wood exterior, not having openings that embers [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1417.1s)]
*  can fly through to ignite the interior of the home. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1424.32s)]
*  Those rules also include things like what you can plant and how close to your house. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1427.66s)]
*  This idea of defensible space. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1433.1s)]
*  Those rules say that as far away as 100 feet from the edge of your structure, you've got [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1434.92s)]
*  to manage the vegetation to reduce the amount of shrubs and mulch and trees that can catch fire. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1439.8s)]
*  Very thorough. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1446.76s)]
*  And then, beyond that, California, pulling out to the macro level, does a lot of things [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1447.76s)]
*  other states I'm sure would love to do. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1453.2s)]
*  They've got a really well-funded state agency called CAL FIRE that predicts fire activity, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1455.32s)]
*  draws maps, but where the risk is the highest, has armies of really well-trained firefighters [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1461.6s)]
*  and resources to move in when they're needed. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1467.08s)]
*  They've got a political culture, perhaps most importantly, that is open to this idea of [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1469.72s)]
*  rules that homeowners have to abide by to reduce their risk. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1475.46s)]
*  And then they've got money. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1480.1000000000001s)]
*  California, one of the largest economies in the world, and the result is they've got a [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1481.1000000000001s)]
*  tax base that can fund just a huge array of measures to harden and protect communities [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1485.04s)]
*  against fires. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1492.8s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like California is particularly vulnerable, but it also has a bunch of things [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1493.8s)]
*  working in its favor, and yet all of those things obviously were not enough to contain [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1498.9399999999998s)]
*  these fires. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1504.22s)]
*  So what does that tell you, Chris? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1505.5s)]
*  So it's exactly the right question. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1508.7s)]
*  It creates kind of a puzzle. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1511.02s)]
*  If California was, in general, pretty ready, what went wrong? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1512.8999999999999s)]
*  But at a big level, California was pretty ready. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1517.86s)]
*  So that raises the question, well, can you be ready enough? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1521.1s)]
*  Is it even possible to do enough as a city or a county or a state or a country to prepare [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1525.42s)]
*  communities against these fires that are getting worse because of climate change? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1532.2600000000002s)]
*  And it's a question that, for the moment, doesn't have a good answer. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1537.5s)]
*  It's kind of like you're asking, is the pace of climate change just faster than the pace [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1541.9s)]
*  of possible adaptation? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1547.5800000000002s)]
*  That's bang on. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  One question is how fast can you improve the protections for places like Los Angeles? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1551.62s)]
*  But another question is how much can you improve it? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1556.6999999999998s)]
*  All the things we talked about, the way home construction is regulated and the way people [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1559.54s)]
*  try to squeeze the flammable vegetation out of a landscape, you can always do more of [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1564.6s)]
*  that. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1570.6999999999998s)]
*  You can build concrete boxes that are just surrounded by gravel and pavement, and there [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1571.6999999999998s)]
*  isn't a shred of wood anywhere in sight or even a tree. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1577.7s)]
*  I don't know if people want to live like that, but in theory you could. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1581.8600000000001s)]
*  You could put more space between houses so that fires have a harder time jumping from [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1584.38s)]
*  house to house. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1589.3s)]
*  You could build bigger buffer zones between the forest and communities so that embers [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1590.3s)]
*  would have to fly even further distance on the wind. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1595.06s)]
*  All of those things would help, and they're all possible, but they're all hard and they [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1598.3s)]
*  eliminate the risk, which as you noted is getting worse just about every year. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1604.26s)]
*  You're saying the more your house can look like an isolated concrete box surrounded by [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1610.3s)]
*  rocks, the better, and even then it wouldn't totally solve it. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1615.52s)]
*  Yeah, and we haven't even talked about cost. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1621.42s)]
*  Even if people were willing to stomach the loss in beauty that these kinds of changes [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1624.58s)]
*  would entail, they're not cheap, right? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1630.02s)]
*  If you want to replace your roof with something that is flame proof or more flame resistant [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1633.14s)]
*  with the steel roofs and stuff like that, it's very expensive. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1637.9s)]
*  Even just managing the vegetation on your property in a way that is effective is not [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1640.74s)]
*  cheap. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1646.0200000000002s)]
*  And then there's the community and sort of public level of cost. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1647.0200000000002s)]
*  If you apply these rules more aggressively and you have more space between homes, so [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1651.5s)]
*  fires have a hard time jumping, and you have fewer homes getting built into the forest [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1656.8600000000001s)]
*  where the risk is highest, that reduces your fire risk, but it means fewer homes. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1661.74s)]
*  And in California right now, as we all know, the housing crisis is really severe. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1666.54s)]
*  So the idea that you would try to combat wildfires by having fewer homes would help, but it would [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1670.92s)]
*  also make another problem even worse. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1678.66s)]
*  So the trade-offs of trying to further squeeze the fire risk out of Los Angeles and out of [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1681.98s)]
*  California are real. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1688.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1690.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, for affordability to tackle the crisis of people living on the streets, California [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1691.1000000000001s)]
*  and LA in particular needs more homes, not fewer. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1697.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1700.8200000000002s)]
*  It's hard to even say what California should do because arguably the homelessness crisis [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1701.8200000000002s)]
*  is as urgent or more urgent than the climate crisis and wildfires. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1706.9s)]
*  There's really no good answer to these questions. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1711.3s)]
*  What you're describing is a situation in which you are really weighing these two crises [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1716.14s)]
*  against one another. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1723.3200000000002s)]
*  And to solve one of them, you need a pretty radical shift in this city. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1725.44s)]
*  What are the odds, do you think, of that actually happening? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1731.5400000000002s)]
*  And I ask this because even though the fires are still raging, we're seeing the beginning [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1735.5400000000002s)]
*  of discussions about what recovery and rebuilding will actually look like. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1739.92s)]
*  Yeah, look, the fundamental question after any big fire in communities like this, the [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1745.74s)]
*  first question has always got to be, how will you rebuild? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1752.26s)]
*  In fact, it's already started. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1756.98s)]
*  Governor Newsom issued an order directing officials to look for ways to ease or suspend [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1758.46s)]
*  provisions of the building code that would make it easier to build back more quickly, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1766.06s)]
*  but also would not be unsafe. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1771.5800000000002s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1775.8600000000001s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1776.8600000000001s)]
*  But in the past, these fires often have been followed by attempts to weaken or loosen temporarily [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1777.8600000000001s)]
*  the standards around how you build. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1785.8200000000002s)]
*  For good reason. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1787.6200000000001s)]
*  People want to rebuild as fast they can, and they want to rebuild as inexpensively as they [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1788.6200000000001s)]
*  can. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1793.42s)]
*  And governments just want to do their best to serve the needs of people who've lost their [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1794.42s)]
*  homes, right? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1798.7s)]
*  That's the most obvious thing you could do. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1800.02s)]
*  The problem is that sets you up against a future where these fires get worse. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1801.5800000000002s)]
*  And so this is also the moment where people who study resilience and climate change will [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1807.42s)]
*  say, actually, this is a good time to tighten the standards so that when we build back, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1812.14s)]
*  we build back homes that are more resistant to wildfires. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1816.38s)]
*  But typically that takes longer. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1820.06s)]
*  So historically, often, those two forces are in opposition after a fire and usually the [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1821.88s)]
*  people calling for easing the standards win out. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1827.28s)]
*  But this time is different because the scale is bigger and because there's no longer really [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1831.3999999999999s)]
*  a debate about climate change. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1835.8999999999999s)]
*  No one is saying that we won't have more of these fires. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1837.58s)]
*  So the question that I'll be watching is to what degree do state and local officials and [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1841.08s)]
*  homeowners use this time to say this really is worth taking a moment and finding a way [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1846.8s)]
*  to build back in a tougher environment because we know the fires will get worse. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1855.28s)]
*  Chris, part of what you're talking about, building fewer houses in the most vulnerable [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1861.46s)]
*  areas in L.A., that would mean a lot of people would need to move. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1866.1s)]
*  And I have to say, these kinds of conversations where we're talking about people relocating [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1871.06s)]
*  things to climate change, I've really only heard them about people who are doing that [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1875.8799999999999s)]
*  because of sea level rise and storm surge. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1881.12s)]
*  It's something we've talked about with you on the show. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1883.9s)]
*  This is really the first time that I've seen it come up in this way in the context of wildfire. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1887.3000000000002s)]
*  These L.A. fires are folding into a bigger conversation in the U.S. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1895.02s)]
*  about whether some communities are just too hard to protect against climate shocks. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1900.14s)]
*  And you're right, until now, the climate shocks that prompt that conversation have mostly [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1905.6200000000001s)]
*  been rising seas, repetitive flooding and storm surge. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1910.62s)]
*  But these fires might become a turning point. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1914.78s)]
*  They might raise the question of are some communities too exposed to fires to have a [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1918.1s)]
*  reasonable expectation that we can protect people who live there? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1925.34s)]
*  And obviously, we're not talking about emptying out all of L.A. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1928.62s)]
*  That's insane and you wouldn't want to. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1932.26s)]
*  But there may be some neighborhoods around L.A. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1935.06s)]
*  where because of the topography or something else, the risk is so high, experts look at [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1939.38s)]
*  them and say, boy, we probably shouldn't have built homes there in the first place. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1944.94s)]
*  And people might start to ask, maybe it doesn't make sense to build back there. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1948.42s)]
*  And it's important note, even if the changes only affected some small sliver at the edge [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1952.3400000000001s)]
*  of L.A., at the edge of the forest, it would change all of L.A. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1958.66s)]
*  Those people have to live somewhere, right? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1961.98s)]
*  So you'd really have to pair pulling back from a handful of high risk areas with probably [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1963.62s)]
*  building more density in the downtown, in places that are easier to protect. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1970.06s)]
*  So the transformation that that would entail would be really significant for all of L.A. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1974.86s)]
*  And it's a hard conversation. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1980.34s)]
*  There's no no guarantee it's going to happen. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1982.1s)]
*  But it's the kind of thing that I think people are more likely to start talking about [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1984.86s)]
*  because these fires were so bad. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1988.3s)]
*  And it seems important to just say, Chris, that in this case, we're not talking about [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1990.02s)]
*  moving a relatively small coastal community from a barrier island. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=1996.18s)]
*  Here, we're talking about L.A., the second largest city in America, 10 million people [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2000.7s)]
*  in a state that is just an economic engine for the whole country, has the biggest port [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2005.66s)]
*  in America. I mean, what we're envisioning is reshaping a major metropolis. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2010.58s)]
*  And that's not just a huge investment of money, right? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2017.6999999999998s)]
*  It's also a massive emotional investment in just a new identity. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2021.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And look, I've covered these conversations for a long time. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2025.5s)]
*  Anytime you're talking about changing a community deliberately because of growing [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2028.78s)]
*  threats, it's really hard. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2034.1399999999999s)]
*  You'll get many homeowners who just say, no, I want to rebuild exactly the way it was. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2035.4199999999998s)]
*  My life has been turned upside down enough. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2041.54s)]
*  I don't want anyone talking about maybe I should leave. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2043.9399999999998s)]
*  But others will say, oh, what we just lived through was terrible. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2046.9s)]
*  I'm not sure I want to do it again. Right. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2051.3s)]
*  Then there's the question of is it even fair to put future homeowners in that situation [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2053.34s)]
*  where, as we now know, fires can emerge almost out of nowhere in January. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2059.34s)]
*  Right. That cause disastrous scale damage. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2064.58s)]
*  Fires like this open the door to talking about maybe the change that's going to happen [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2069.26s)]
*  anyway. Half this fire should include some sort of calculated decisions around. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2074.9s)]
*  Are there places that you can't protect? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2080.86s)]
*  That may be a question we need to grapple with, but it's also a really difficult thing [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2084.26s)]
*  to ask when people are in a lot of pain and just reeling from all this loss. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2089.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost too hard to ask. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2097.06s)]
*  Right. But the last week of fires show that you have to at least think about it [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2100.38s)]
*  because fires like this demand that you at least try to be honest with yourself and your [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2106.1800000000003s)]
*  neighbors and your voters about the kind of risk we're taking on when we build or [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2113.1s)]
*  rebuild in places that we know are inherently dangerous and getting more dangerous. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2119.14s)]
*  In some of those really high risk places, maybe we can't keep pretending that we can [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2130.2200000000003s)]
*  save every house if it's facing a fire, which is a terrifying thing to admit. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2135.62s)]
*  And it's a huge shift in attitude because this country wants to say that we're ready [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2141.82s)]
*  and prepared to protect homes, to have firefighters come to the rescue. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2147.54s)]
*  But as we've seen from Los Angeles, sometimes there's still nothing they can do. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2152.46s)]
*  So, you know, at some point, the U.S. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2157.14s)]
*  might have to say to itself, if you live in these high risk areas, there's no guarantee [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2160.1s)]
*  for safety. And that kind of brutal honesty is the hardest thing to do. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2166.58s)]
*  It's not how Americans want to think. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2173.02s)]
*  But climate change is pushing us in that direction. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2177.42s)]
*  And none of those solutions are really satisfying. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2181.18s)]
*  But here we are. We've got a gigantic city in a fire zone. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2184.7799999999997s)]
*  So maybe that's the best there is. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2188.18s)]
*  Chris, thank you so much. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2197.2999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2199.5s)]
*  Over the weekend, firefighters slowed the progress of the Palisades and Eaton fires, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2205.9s)]
*  which are now partly contained. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2210.54s)]
*  But winds in Los Angeles are expected to pick back up again, prompting officials to [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2213.02s)]
*  issue a rare fire danger alert for Tuesday until Wednesday afternoon. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2217.46s)]
*  The National Weather Service warned that the gusts could lead to, quote, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTNxfU8I1rA&t=2222.34s)]
