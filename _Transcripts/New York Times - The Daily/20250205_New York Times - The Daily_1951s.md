# How Elon Musk Is Infiltrating Washington
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=4.08s)]
*  Today, Elon Musk and his team have taken a hacksaw to the federal bureaucracy one agency [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=8.0s)]
*  at a time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=17.68s)]
*  And the question has become whether he's on a crusade that will leave the government [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=18.68s)]
*  paralyzed or deliver exactly the kind of shakeup it's needed for years. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  My colleague, Jonathan Swan, takes us inside this hostile takeover of Washington. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=27.28s)]
*  It's Wednesday, February 5th. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  So Jonathan, we always understood that Elon Musk was going to be important in this administration [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=51.84s)]
*  in the second Trump presidency. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump had given the group that Musk was put in charge of, the Department of Government [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=59.6s)]
*  Efficiency or DOJ as it's commonly known, the job of shrinking the entire federal government. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  But the question was always just how much power Musk would actually have as a private [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=69.30000000000001s)]
*  citizen operating outside the president's cabinet. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=74.0s)]
*  And over the past few days, we've actually started to get an answer, which is a whole [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=77.2s)]
*  lot of power. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=80.64s)]
*  Yes, his power is extraordinary. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=81.64s)]
*  He effectively is unaccountable. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=84.92s)]
*  Donald Trump has fully empowered him to roam across the federal government, get inside [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=88.36s)]
*  the pipes of the federal government, look at the payment systems and the databases to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=95.4s)]
*  embed inside these agencies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=101.72s)]
*  So this is not some chin stroking professor doing an analysis of government from the outside [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=104.8s)]
*  and let me sit down at my table and write you some recommendations. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Walter Isaacson wrote a biography about Elon Musk where people who know him talk about [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=118.96s)]
*  quote unquote, demon mode, which he goes into, which is this sort of manic energy, staying [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=123.12s)]
*  up all night, sleeping on the floor of the factory. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=128.78s)]
*  He's done this at Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter, setting unrealistic deadlines, doing mass [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=132.92s)]
*  layoffs because he thinks stuff aren't hardcore enough. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=138.78s)]
*  He's effectively trying to do that to the federal government. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  His team have moved beds into agency offices. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  How? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=149.88s)]
*  He has an office space in the West Wing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=150.88s)]
*  And he also has been working out of this opulent Secretary of War suite in the Eisenhower [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=153.72s)]
*  Executive Office building. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=159.27999999999997s)]
*  He's brought with him this cohort from Silicon Valley, people who've worked for him at Tesla [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=161.12s)]
*  and SpaceX, and he's installed them in some of the most important parts of government. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=165.64s)]
*  So this is Elon Musk getting his hands into government, doing what he's done at these [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=170.92s)]
*  companies. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  And remember, we should say he's been in the private sector, probably the singular entrepreneur [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  of our lifetime. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=183.76s)]
*  But if you understand what he's done with his business, he is marked by incredible risk [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=184.76s)]
*  taking, extreme risk taking and a willingness to if he or his employees consider regulations [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=189.12s)]
*  or laws to be quote unquote dumb, he pushes them and particularly at SpaceX to defy those [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=196.8s)]
*  regulations, just do it anyway. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  And if people want to sue, so be it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=206.44s)]
*  If it gets to the mission of what he's trying to accomplish, we're seeing that kind of approach [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=209.72000000000003s)]
*  inside government right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=215.08s)]
*  OK, so what is that demon mode risk taking ethos actually look like that he's applying [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=217.12s)]
*  to the government? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=221.56s)]
*  What has he been up to this past week? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=222.56s)]
*  Well, the first sign of Musk and his team moving into government, the first physical [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=224.28s)]
*  sign was literally right after Trump's inauguration, the day after. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=229.08s)]
*  Workers in the Eisenhower Executive Office building, which is the big building next to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  the West Wing, they show up to work and this building houses some operations for the United [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  States Digital Service. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=243.58s)]
*  This is to an operation that was set up in 2014 to fix the federal government's online [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=245.12s)]
*  services and they find a sticky note saying Doge, D-O-G-E on a door to a suite that was [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=249.52s)]
*  once used as a workspace. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=258.04s)]
*  A literal post-it note. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=259.56s)]
*  Yeah, literally a sticky note on the door saying Doge and this used to be a workspace [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=261.0s)]
*  for senior technologists at the agency and inside there were these black backpacks that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=265.2s)]
*  were strewn about. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=272.12s)]
*  You had these young engineers, many of them in their 20s, some of them were wearing t-shirts [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=274.28s)]
*  with blazers over them, roaming the halls, unfamiliar faces, didn't have security badges [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=280.0s)]
*  on that federal employees typically take when they go into offices. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  And it turned out that this was the Musk army, the cohort of young men who work for Musk [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=291.38s)]
*  or who are in his network and they have come to Washington to help Musk on his mission [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  of slashing the federal government. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=304.12s)]
*  And the message is really clear, they have arrived. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=305.88s)]
*  Yeah, and they're not wasting any time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=308.48s)]
*  My colleagues and I have talked to federal employees at different agencies and it's really [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=313.68s)]
*  quite extraordinary. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=318.08s)]
*  I mean, these Musk allies are interviewing people across agencies, asking them what have [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=319.08s)]
*  you done lately? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=325.4s)]
*  Give me examples of work you've done. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=326.56s)]
*  Justify your job. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=328.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=329.4s)]
*  The federal employees ask them, well, who are you? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=330.84s)]
*  In some cases, they're refusing to give their names because they don't want to be doxed [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  or they'll just give their first name. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=337.88s)]
*  So there's this sort of atmosphere of we're putting the fear of God into all of you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  And there is a real hostility that they're showing to the federal workforce. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=348.88s)]
*  They're really trying to send the message that we've arrived, this conversation goes [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=349.88s)]
*  one way, we ask the questions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=353.23999999999995s)]
*  What's the next big thing that happens last week? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=356.12s)]
*  Well, there's been so much, but one of the big signs of Musk's imprint was an email that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  went out to roughly two million federal workers, which is really kind of in itself extraordinary. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=366.6s)]
*  This is not something that normally happens. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=374.0s)]
*  And they sent out this email offering them the option to resign but be paid through the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=376.36s)]
*  end of September. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=381.56s)]
*  The email subject line, Fork in the Road, was the same one that Musk used in the email [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=383.88s)]
*  he sent to Twitter employees when he offered them severance packages in late 2022. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=389.2s)]
*  And it says, basically, we'd love you to resign, quit your lower productivity public sector [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=394.68s)]
*  job and take a higher productivity private sector job. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=401.08s)]
*  So it literally devalued their jobs. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=404.24s)]
*  So he's basically encouraging people to leave the government entirely and do something quote [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  unquote, more productive in the private sector, which I can imagine if you're a civil servant [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=412.68s)]
*  that feels like you're being treated with contempt. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=417.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=421.04s)]
*  And then Musk goes further and starts targeting other departments. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=422.04s)]
*  So where does he start? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=426.24s)]
*  Musk began as a matter of priority with the Treasury Department. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=428.44s)]
*  His team, and this goes back to December during the transition, but they became fixated on [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=433.8s)]
*  the payment system for the entire federal government that literally distributes more [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=441.04s)]
*  than five trillion dollars a year in federal spending. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=446.56s)]
*  So just imagine millions of Americans, social security details and personal details, a very, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=450.76s)]
*  very closely guarded system, usually monitored by career civil servants who are very experienced. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=458.28s)]
*  And this came to a head last week when a top career official at Treasury resisted giving [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=465.52s)]
*  Musk's representatives access to the federal payment system. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=472.92s)]
*  He just said no. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=477.52s)]
*  He just said no, this is not going to happen. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=478.56s)]
*  I don't agree with this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=480.72s)]
*  And he was threatened with administrative leave and then retired. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=482.92s)]
*  So all this happens on Friday. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=487.04s)]
*  And then the Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, approved access for the Musk team to the payment [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=488.36s)]
*  system. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=495.2s)]
*  OK, so let me see if I understand this. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=496.2s)]
*  Musk sends his guys in there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=498.32s)]
*  They demand access to this very sensitive system. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=499.96s)]
*  It runs all the payments for the federal government. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=502.44s)]
*  Somebody tries to resist and that guy basically quote unquote retires, meaning maybe gets [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  fired and then they get in the pipes anyway. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=511.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=514.76s)]
*  And when we talk to former senior Treasury officials, they can't remember of an instance [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=515.76s)]
*  ever when this has happened. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  And there are understandable concerns that an intrusion into the system by outsiders [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=525.16s)]
*  such as Musk's team could lead to critical government obligations going unpaid from [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=530.92s)]
*  missed benefit payments to even more dramatic consequences. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=539.52s)]
*  Now, very important to note, the White House has said on the record now, it took a while [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=544.4s)]
*  for us to get clarity on this, that the access they were granted was quote unquote read [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=550.92s)]
*  only. At least that's what it is now. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=557.0s)]
*  Meaning the Musk allies who are now Treasury officials can read and monitor these [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=559.48s)]
*  payments, but can't alter them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=566.12s)]
*  Why do we think Musk wants access to the actual system? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=568.72s)]
*  Like, why does he even want his people in their reading? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=573.6s)]
*  There's two parts to this. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=576.28s)]
*  So we've talked to a lot of people who Musk has talked to privately within the administration. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=577.76s)]
*  His theory of government is the way to control government is to control the computers. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=582.32s)]
*  So he wants to get access to the computers that house the critical data within the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  government, including all the personnel that are on the federal payroll, and also to get [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  access to the pipes that distribute the money. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=601.08s)]
*  And Musk has told administration officials that he thinks they could actually balance [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=603.76s)]
*  the federal budget if they eliminate all the fraudulent payments that are going out to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=608.36s)]
*  fake people. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=612.48s)]
*  There's no evidence to support that statement that I'm aware of. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=614.1600000000001s)]
*  But to be fair to Musk, there are billions upon billions of dollars in improper payments [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=619.1600000000001s)]
*  that go out. There was a government Accountability Office estimate that the government made [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=623.12s)]
*  something like $236 billion in improper payments during the 2023 fiscal year. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=627.64s)]
*  Most of those were overpayments. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=633.92s)]
*  This is to different people around the country, Social Security, what have you. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=635.8s)]
*  That's a lot of money, to be clear. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=639.76s)]
*  It's a lot of money. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=641.48s)]
*  And there is potential for cost savings here. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=642.84s)]
*  But I mean, the federal deficit for 2024 was almost $2 trillion. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=645.84s)]
*  So Musk is of the view that the government is spending vast amounts of money that is [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=652.0s)]
*  wasteful, fraudulent. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=659.52s)]
*  And in his sort of platonic ideal, his engineers would just be able to cut off these payments [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  that are going out unilaterally. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  And the question then is, OK, well, what then? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=672.76s)]
*  Because this is money appropriated by Congress. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=675.96s)]
*  And it's not actually up to Elon Musk to unilaterally, with his team, direct what payments go out [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=680.32s)]
*  and what payments stay in. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=691.6800000000001s)]
*  It seems, Jonathan, that the fundamental sort of animus and feeling underneath all of these [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=694.0400000000001s)]
*  actions that you've described, the email getting inside the pipes of Treasury, is this basic [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=699.64s)]
*  distrust or even disdain of government operations. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=705.24s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't need to editorialize or speak in my own words on this. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=710.88s)]
*  I mean, just listen to the people involved in this. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=716.52s)]
*  Russell Vogt, who served in Trump's first administration, and he's his choice again [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=719.04s)]
*  to lead the Office of Management and Budget. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=724.52s)]
*  He said in a 2023 speech talking about the plans for their coming back into power, he [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=727.2s)]
*  said, we want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=736.0s)]
*  He said, when they wake up in the morning, we want them not to go into work because they [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=737.0s)]
*  are increasingly viewed as the villains. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=741.52s)]
*  He's very close ally with Elon Musk and Musk himself has the same mindset. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=744.44s)]
*  I mean, it's very revealing the language he's using. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=748.96s)]
*  He said, very few in the bureaucracy actually work the weekend. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=752.12s)]
*  So it's like the opposing team just leaves the field for two days. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=755.52s)]
*  So you see the mindset. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=759.88s)]
*  We are coming in and now fully empowered by the President of the United States with the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=761.96s)]
*  attitude of this is a government full of incompetent people, full of people who don't do any work, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=766.4s)]
*  who are lazy, don't work the weekends. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=773.52s)]
*  And we are coming in here with the sort of bureaucratic version of a bazooka. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=776.0s)]
*  And he's even talked about eliminating entire agencies. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=785.36s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=795.84s)]
*  So, Jonathan, you mentioned earlier that Elon Musk set his sights on entire agencies. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=811.96s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=813.08s)]
*  Well, he has turned his attention very aggressively towards the US Agency for International Development, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  which is known as USAID. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=822.88s)]
*  This is the agency that is charged with delivering humanitarian assistance overseas to some of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=824.8000000000001s)]
*  the most vulnerable people around the world, you know, nutritional assistance for children [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=831.64s)]
*  designed to help promote stability and humanitarianism. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=838.0s)]
*  And we've seen now a pretty stunning series of events. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=843.36s)]
*  A week ago, members of Musk's team entered the headquarters of USAID. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=852.72s)]
*  They demanded and were granted access to the agency's financial and personnel systems. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=859.96s)]
*  During that period, an acting administrator at the agency put about 60 senior officials [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=866.0s)]
*  on paid leave and issued stop work orders that led to the firing of hundreds of contractors [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=871.6s)]
*  with full-time employment and health benefits. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=878.0s)]
*  By Saturday, the agency's website vanished, like literally just disappeared, went dark. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=882.0s)]
*  And when the top two security directors at USAID tried to stop members of the Musk team [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=887.72s)]
*  from entering a secure area to get classified files, they were placed on administrative [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=892.76s)]
*  leave. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=897.96s)]
*  Katie Miller, who works on the Musk Initiative, said on X that no classified material was [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=899.44s)]
*  accessed without proper security clearances. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=903.36s)]
*  But by Monday, USAID was effectively paralyzed. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=905.48s)]
*  And Musk has said that the president agreed that we should shut it down. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=910.32s)]
*  Is Musk just allowed to come in and shut down an entire agency just like that? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=922.12s)]
*  I mean, is Trump fully supportive of this? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=927.28s)]
*  Well, remember, it's Congress, not the president, that gets to decide how to structure the executive [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=930.0s)]
*  branch of government. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=936.88s)]
*  And Congress has enacted laws that say USAID should exist as an independent establishment. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=937.88s)]
*  So this is running directly into very serious legal questions and questions about whether [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=943.72s)]
*  Congress is going to assert itself as Trump basically runs roughshod over the institution. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=951.36s)]
*  And in terms of Musk's own authority, he's effectively unaccountable because Trump has [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=959.76s)]
*  given him his blessing. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=965.88s)]
*  It's not like Trump is really interested in the minutia of the United States digital service [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=966.88s)]
*  or the treasury payment system or all of these pretty wonky and in some cases quite obscure [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=972.4s)]
*  parts of government that Musk and his team are taking control of. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=978.96s)]
*  He keeps Trump, you know, abreast. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=983.72s)]
*  He drops into White House meetings. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=986.16s)]
*  He has an office in the West Wing. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=988.24s)]
*  He'll go into the Oval, talk to Trump on the phone. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=989.92s)]
*  But even like senior members of the White House staff have found themselves in the dark [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=993.4s)]
*  about what he's doing and trying to figure out after the fact. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=999.24s)]
*  One Trump official that one of my colleagues talked to, who only spoke on the condition [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1004.36s)]
*  of anonymity, said that Musk was widely seen as operating with a level of autonomy that [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1007.88s)]
*  almost no one can control. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1013.76s)]
*  In other words, demon mode, as we described earlier. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1015.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1019.48s)]
*  So you now have a situation where you have an entire federal agency that's responsible [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1020.64s)]
*  for delivering aid around the world, where employees there are in a state of confusion, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1027.44s)]
*  anxiety. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1034.96s)]
*  They don't know whether their agency will exist. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1036.6000000000001s)]
*  Sure doesn't look like it will. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1039.24s)]
*  And no one can say this is a surprise. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1041.24s)]
*  Trump campaigned on this that we shouldn't be spending money overseas, that we should [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1044.4s)]
*  cut our foreign spending and has been very clear that he intended to do this. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1048.4s)]
*  So while there are really serious legal and constitutional questions about this, nobody [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1053.8s)]
*  who's been reading our coverage and listening to Donald Trump for the last four years should [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1059.88s)]
*  have any level of surprise that he's doing this. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1064.48s)]
*  But how much of this is actually about the budget of USAID? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1068.4s)]
*  It doesn't strike me as sort of the biggest agency if you were looking for big cuts. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1073.32s)]
*  Is this a huge amount of money? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1078.8s)]
*  Is it about something that's beyond the money? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1080.0s)]
*  Well USAID makes up less than 1% of the federal budget. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1083.08s)]
*  It spent about $38 billion in fiscal year 23. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1087.84s)]
*  Elon Musk has said that their success will be measured on how many dollars per day they [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1091.6s)]
*  slash from federal spending. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1097.3999999999999s)]
*  So they are looking for dollars everywhere. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1099.32s)]
*  But there's definitely an ideological component here. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1102.6s)]
*  Elon Musk has called USAID evil. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1105.56s)]
*  That's not just saying, oh, there's $38 billion we want to trim out. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1108.12s)]
*  No, this is an evil institution in his mind. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  If you are looking for the platonic ideal of an agency that cuts against the quote unquote [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1116.52s)]
*  America first agenda, it's probably the agency that sends money in foreign aid overseas. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1123.52s)]
*  The White House sent out a list of things that they say that the USAID is doing that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1129.76s)]
*  do not align with the president's agenda. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1136.46s)]
*  They picked out examples that relate to diversity, equity and inclusion around the world. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1139.04s)]
*  And basically the impression that the White House has sought to create in the public mind [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1146.36s)]
*  is this is a quote unquote woke agency run by radical lunatics in Trump's words that [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1151.76s)]
*  is spreading left wing gender ideology around the world. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1158.36s)]
*  And we're going to shut it down to save taxpayer money. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1162.6s)]
*  Where do you think Musk and Doge go from here? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1165.6s)]
*  Because we're only two weeks into the new administration. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1168.1599999999999s)]
*  So I'm wondering if you expect that he's going to continue to operate without much resistance. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1170.8s)]
*  So it's really interesting. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1176.48s)]
*  After Trump won the election, won the popular vote, Democrats have been just a mess, you [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1177.48s)]
*  know, divided, everyone coming up with different theories about why they lost, depressed, some [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1185.32s)]
*  of them capitulating. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1192.04s)]
*  We've just seen in the last few days the resistance starting to awaken. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1195.02s)]
*  And it's actually not Trump who's awakened them. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1200.1999999999998s)]
*  It's oddly Elon Musk. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1202.5s)]
*  We're starting to see organized labor rally against him. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1207.82s)]
*  You're seeing lawsuits being filed. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1212.3s)]
*  When our constitution is under attack, what do we do? [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1214.82s)]
*  Stand up like that! [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1217.9399999999998s)]
*  You saw protests in DC outside the buildings of OPM, USAID and the Treasury. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1219.3s)]
*  Trump is a puppet of a foreign national whose name is Musk, who has taken over our data, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1225.02s)]
*  who has taken over our buildings, has locked federal workers out of buildings. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1231.18s)]
*  Democratic members of the Senate who've been pretty quiet since the election are starting [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1235.86s)]
*  to voice their outrage about what Musk is doing. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1240.6599999999999s)]
*  We don't have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk, and that's going to become [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1244.74s)]
*  real clear. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1250.5s)]
*  You're starting to see the resistance, which had been really in hiding since the election, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1251.5s)]
*  start to emerge again. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1258.54s)]
*  It is embarrassing to read the headlines about free America, where one man is walking around [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1260.02s)]
*  like he is the boss of all of us and we don't know who put him in charge. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1268.6200000000001s)]
*  And it is time for us to put an end to that. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1273.9s)]
*  Now people have been predicting for weeks that Trump and Elon Musk would fall out, that [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1282.02s)]
*  this relationship would not be sustainable. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1287.46s)]
*  It's actually been much more durable than many people thought. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1289.1000000000001s)]
*  Trump almost entirely speaks very warmly of Musk in private, but he did sound a little [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1293.6200000000001s)]
*  bit of a cautionary note on Monday when he was asked about Musk by reporters and he said, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1300.14s)]
*  quote, Elon can't do and won't do anything without our approval. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1305.7s)]
*  And he said, if there's a conflict, then we won't let him near it. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1310.0600000000002s)]
*  That's fine to say that, but it's not really what's happening in practice. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1314.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1318.3400000000001s)]
*  So Jonathan, is there an argument to be made that this kind of slash and burn tactic is [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1319.3400000000001s)]
*  actually the only way to carry out the promise that Musk and Trump have made about shrinking [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1324.66s)]
*  the government and that also given Musk's track record in the private sector and his [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1329.8799999999999s)]
*  unique standing with Trump, Musk is uniquely positioned. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1335.3999999999999s)]
*  Some might even say he's really qualified to make these kind of cuts in a way that nobody [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1339.96s)]
*  has before. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1344.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, I think there's sort of two separate parts to this. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1347.0s)]
*  One is, is Elon Musk a brilliant entrepreneur who has shown that he is very ruthless about [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1350.0s)]
*  cost cutting to the point where he's taken several of his companies to the brink of destruction [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1357.9199999999998s)]
*  before rescuing them and in the cases of Tesla and SpaceX, turning them into transformational [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1365.52s)]
*  companies? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1370.32s)]
*  Yes, yes, all of that is true. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1371.32s)]
*  Where this becomes thorny is we're not talking about an electric car company where, let's [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1374.04s)]
*  say Elon Musk didn't manage to pull it back from the brink and it failed. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1379.6799999999998s)]
*  The only casualties of that are a slower transition to electric cars. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1383.84s)]
*  Some investors lose their money. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1389.7199999999998s)]
*  Some engineers lose their jobs. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1391.24s)]
*  Not to diminish that. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1393.28s)]
*  But now you're talking about the federal government writ large. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1394.4399999999998s)]
*  So is there the possibility that Elon Musk could and Trump could slash huge amounts of [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1397.4799999999998s)]
*  money out of the federal government? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1402.9599999999998s)]
*  Yes, of course there is. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1404.12s)]
*  But the stakes feel really different here. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1405.28s)]
*  The stakes are different. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1407.76s)]
*  Right. You're talking about the country and the federal government. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1408.8799999999999s)]
*  And you're talking about the public interest. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1412.2s)]
*  And just take one example. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1416.24s)]
*  Right. Elon Musk leads this effort to send out this email to the entire federal workforce, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1417.92s)]
*  you know, email saying basically, we'd love if you would just resign. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1423.48s)]
*  Just think about that for a second. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1428.68s)]
*  Who are the federal employees that are most likely to take that offer? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1430.44s)]
*  It's probably people who have options outside, who are sought after, who have technical [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1434.24s)]
*  expertise that is valuable, that private sector companies could benefit from. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1441.0s)]
*  So you're going to potentially lose actually the thin layer at the top that is most [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1445.56s)]
*  skilled, most experienced and potentially most critical to the functionings of government. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1452.6s)]
*  So basically what you're saying is that you're encouraging possibly the most talented, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1459.32s)]
*  maybe some of the most important civil servants across the government who do a range of [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1464.6s)]
*  things to leave. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1468.6s)]
*  And that does raise a really interesting question of who is left. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1470.48s)]
*  Yes. And the other thing that is challenging with this reporting on Elon Musk is that in [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1475.08s)]
*  this role, it's actually very hard sometimes to discern where the public interest ends [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1482.4399999999998s)]
*  and where Elon Musk's private interests begin. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1490.12s)]
*  Well, let's talk about his private interests, actually, because there's a whole other [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1493.8s)]
*  dimension to this that we haven't even talked about, which is how much business Elon Musk [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1497.96s)]
*  does with the federal government. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1502.72s)]
*  Even if you think he's the right person to cut it down, and even if you think his [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1504.88s)]
*  experience at Twitter is relevant here, and just to remind people, when he took over [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1509.72s)]
*  Twitter and gutted it and got rid of a lot of employees, people said Twitter will never [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1514.6000000000001s)]
*  survive this. And obviously, TwitterX is very much still operational. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1518.68s)]
*  Even if you think all of that experience is relevant, he still has all kinds of potential [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1523.88s)]
*  conflicts of interest. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1529.76s)]
*  So tell us a little bit about that. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1530.92s)]
*  Well, you have the richest man in the world whose companies have billions of dollars [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1533.48s)]
*  worth of contracts with the federal government. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1540.36s)]
*  I mean, SpaceX, his rocket company, effectively dictates NASA's launch schedule. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1543.36s)]
*  And you have the president of the United States giving Musk vast power over the bureaucracy [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1550.88s)]
*  that regulates his companies and awards them contracts. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1556.56s)]
*  The intermingling is extremely tight. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1561.28s)]
*  He's shaping not just policy, but personnel decisions. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1565.56s)]
*  Officially, Musk is serving as a special government employee, according to the White [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1569.36s)]
*  House. But this is a status typically given to part time outside advisors to the federal [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1573.76s)]
*  government who offer their advice based on their private sector expertise. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1579.4s)]
*  And so he has not had to divest from any of his businesses. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1585.16s)]
*  He still retains his interests in all his businesses. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1589.5600000000002s)]
*  And he is hardly a part time advisor offering advice. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1592.64s)]
*  And that's before we even get to his foreign conflicts. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1599.72s)]
*  Tesla has relied to a significant extent on the Chinese government and the Chinese [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1604.44s)]
*  market. So there are just conflicts as far as the eye can see. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1609.72s)]
*  And while Trump has asserted that where there's a conflict of interest, they won't [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1615.24s)]
*  allow Musk to play in that area. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1620.16s)]
*  The bare facts already disprove that. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1622.64s)]
*  Jonathan, you have covered Trump and those around him for years, obviously. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1626.8400000000001s)]
*  And their biggest complaint, and you hear this almost every day from people like Stephen [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1631.28s)]
*  Miller, one of the president's top advisors you profiled on the show last week, is that [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1635.52s)]
*  the federal government has become overrun by unelected bureaucrats who are accountable [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1640.68s)]
*  to nobody. They don't face elections. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1646.08s)]
*  And in fact, even a few days ago, Elon Musk himself said it was time to, quote, restore [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1648.68s)]
*  power to the people from the vast unelected bureaucracy. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1655.16s)]
*  But given everything you've laid out here for us, it feels like Musk and Doge have [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1659.36s)]
*  become arguably the most powerful unelected bureaucracy possibly in the history of the [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1664.6799999999998s)]
*  country. So what they used to exist in this country was the spoil system, was a [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1670.6s)]
*  patronage system where when power changed hands, government was stocked with [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1675.44s)]
*  supporters, people were awarded with jobs. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  A series of laws were passed that made the civil service permanent effectively or gave [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1684.24s)]
*  them really strong job protections, with the idea being that people develop expertise [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1689.8400000000001s)]
*  over a long period of time. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1695.0s)]
*  These are not inherently political jobs or shouldn't be. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1697.0s)]
*  And what we're potentially seeing right now is the return to that spoil system, to [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1700.3200000000002s)]
*  eliminating this permanent bureaucracy and replacing it each time a new president comes [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1708.64s)]
*  in with their cohort, not just for a thin layer at the top, as happens every [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1715.64s)]
*  administration, but for something for a much larger group of people. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1721.24s)]
*  And when you have the richest man in the world leading this effort, still holding his [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1725.64s)]
*  interests in his private companies, still his company's doing billions of dollars of [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1734.0s)]
*  business with the federal government, still with his companies being regulated by the [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1738.88s)]
*  federal government, you have a level of conflict of interest that we've just never [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1743.44s)]

*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1785.92s)]
*  Today, I'm delighted to welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back to the [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1804.44s)]
*  White House. It's a wonderful feeling and a wonderful event. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1809.8400000000001s)]
*  In a joint news conference on Tuesday night at the White House, President Trump said the [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1814.68s)]
*  United States would take over Gaza, permanently relocate two million of its Palestinian [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1818.88s)]
*  residents and turn the enclave into, quote, the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1824.3200000000002s)]
*  This was not a decision made lightly. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1829.0800000000002s)]
*  Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1831.4s)]
*  developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1836.64s)]
*  Trump said that developing Gaza would supply jobs and housing for, quote, the people of [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1841.5600000000002s)]
*  the area, a vague reference that aligns with the far-right coalition within Netanyahu's [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1846.6000000000001s)]
*  government, which wants to repopulate Gaza with Israelis. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1851.8400000000001s)]
*  The statement was also striking because it contradicted decades of U.S. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1856.44s)]
*  policy that has favored a two-state solution. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1860.0800000000002s)]
*  But just like statements the president has made about taking over Greenland and the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1864.28s)]
*  Panama Canal, Trump did not cite any legal authority that would allow him to take Gaza [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1868.04s)]
*  over, nor did he address the fact that forcible removal of an entire population [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1872.96s)]
*  violates international law. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1878.08s)]
*  And on Tuesday, China responded to the 10 percent tariff imposed by Trump with a flurry [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1882.88s)]
*  of retaliatory measures, including tariffs of its own on liquefied natural gas, coal [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1889.4s)]
*  and farm machinery imported from the U.S. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1894.56s)]
*  The back and forth demonstrated how quickly Trump's tariffs can escalate into a series [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1897.84s)]
*  of painful tit-for-tat economic reprisals. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZ-gvaIVXeo&t=1902.04s)]
