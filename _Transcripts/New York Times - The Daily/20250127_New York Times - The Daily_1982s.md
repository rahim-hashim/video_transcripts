# Stephen Miller’s Return to Power
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=5.24s)]
*  At the center of Trump's aggressive first week in office is a 39-year-old advisor, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=13.86s)]
*  Stephen Miller. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=19.2s)]
*  It's his ideas and ideology that have animated the president's unprecedented blitz of executive [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=21.36s)]
*  orders. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=27.52s)]
*  Today, my colleague Jonathan Swan explains Miller's dramatic return to the White House [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=28.84s)]
*  and why his power has never been greater. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=34.72s)]
*  It's Monday, January 27th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=45.8s)]
*  Jonathan, welcome back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=54.28s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=56.08s)]
*  I think a lot of us remember Stephen Miller from the first Trump term. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=57.44s)]
*  But now that he's back, what do we need to know about who Miller has become and the role [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=61.12s)]
*  he's going to play this time around? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=65.88s)]
*  Well, he's immensely powerful. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=67.96s)]
*  I could make a case that he is one of, if not the most powerful, unelected people in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=70.72s)]
*  America right now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=75.72s)]
*  He is Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, which may not sound that impressive. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=80.08s)]
*  To take all the jargon away, he is in charge of domestic policy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=87.48s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=91.88s)]
*  President Donald Trump's second term in the White House began with a flurry of unilateral [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=93.08s)]
*  actions and he's showing no signs of slowing down. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=97.36s)]
*  So many of the executive orders that you've seen, Donald Trump's sign with his Sharpie [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=100.64s)]
*  in his first week in office, were the work of Stephen Miller. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=106.8s)]
*  Sir, this is an executive order realigning the United States refugee admission program. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=110.52s)]
*  This is a proclamation guaranteeing the state's protection against invasion based on the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=115.8s)]
*  current crisis at the southern border. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=120.12s)]
*  This next order relates to the definition of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  Birthright. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  That's a big one. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  And Miller's vision that he's articulated for decades is now translated into these [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=129.88s)]
*  executive actions. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=136.92s)]
*  So okay, tell us how Miller got here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=141.56s)]
*  How did he arrive at the beliefs that are now defining these opening days and really [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=144.28s)]
*  shifting the country to the right, especially on immigration? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=150.44s)]
*  Well, he actually came to these beliefs very early on. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=153.8s)]
*  Stephen Miller was talking about this populist nationalist stuff as a child. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=158.24s)]
*  He grew up in Santa Monica, California in the 90s. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=165.72s)]
*  He grew up in a fairly comfortable Jewish family. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=169.7s)]
*  He was at this liberal high school and he was this provocateur. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=173.96s)]
*  He was already attacking the left and making controversial anti-immigrant statements when [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=179.88s)]
*  he was in high school. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=189.32s)]
*  And so much so that his classmates made a documentary about him singling him out as [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  a future politician. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=195.0s)]
*  Hi, I'm Stephen Miller. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=197.0s)]
*  And you know, he runs for student government. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=201.08s)]
*  Am I the only one who is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=203.56s)]
*  And we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do it for us. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=210.52s)]
*  And when I heard what he said, I was outraged because that shows... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=214.84s)]
*  Campaigning on the kids' rights to leave a mess so that the janitors should pick up their [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=218.36s)]
*  trash because they're paid to do so. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=223.72000000000003s)]
*  He complained about the school's Spanish language announcements, complained about the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  colorful festivals of minority cultures and described this decline, as he saw it, of a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=232.68s)]
*  more traditional version of American education. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=240.68s)]
*  I will say and I will do things that no one else in their right mind would say or do. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=244.44s)]
*  So all of this that you're seeing now was visible as far back as high school. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  And I have to imagine, Jonathan, I mean, he's in LA. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=259.32s)]
*  He's in Santa Monica. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=262.12s)]
*  This is generally a kind of liberal environment. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=263.72s)]
*  And he's going against the grain here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=267.16s)]
*  So there's a part of that that's about, you know, contradicting the people that are around [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  him, the environment around him. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=276.76s)]
*  It also just sounds like there's a piece of this that is really genuinely xenophobic. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=278.44s)]
*  He is extremely hostile to immigrants. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=283.96s)]
*  He has always, as far back as high school, rejected the idea that immigration is a net [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=287.24s)]
*  positive for America. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=292.44s)]
*  And he's been very consistent in that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=294.2s)]
*  And it's worth noting, yes, he grew up in this very liberal environment in Los Angeles, but [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=296.52s)]
*  it was also a moment of a huge influx of immigrants in California where there were many [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=302.6s)]
*  conservatives in the states who were railing against it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=309.32s)]
*  So it's not like his ideas were coming out of thin air. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=312.92s)]
*  And he really plugged into this right-wing ecosystem. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=316.44s)]
*  He would call up Larry Elder, a very well-known right-wing commentator in California, who was [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=320.92s)]
*  an early mentor to Stephen Miller. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  He was obsessed with Rush Limbaugh, who obviously was a giant in right-wing broadcasting. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=330.28000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, he was really rebelling against the cultural sensitivities of his high school. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  And you saw that continue through college. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=341.08s)]
*  How so? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=345.0s)]
*  So Stephen Miller goes to Duke University and something happens in 2006 that really defines [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=346.44s)]
*  his experience there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=353.4s)]
*  The investigation of rape allegations against Duke University's La Crosse team is still going on. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=354.68s)]
*  This extraordinary incident that happens at Duke where members of La Crosse team at the school were [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=359.88s)]
*  accused of rape. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  An anonymous woman's cry for help shocked a nation. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  And it became this huge national story. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=374.2s)]
*  You had members of the faculty coming out, condemning them before anything was proven. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=377.24s)]
*  Now for the top story tonight. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=384.44s)]
*  Exactly what's going on at Duke University. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=385.8s)]
*  Joining us now from Raleigh, Stephen Miller, columnist for the Duke Chronicle, a student newspaper. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=387.72s)]
*  And Stephen Miller becomes the face of the defense. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=391.88s)]
*  You, a student, pretty much the only person who'll talk to us. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=397.48s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, you have a situation here where, like a lot of college campuses, you have this segment of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  professors that's very powerful and very, very far to the left. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=406.52000000000004s)]
*  Suddenly he's on TV. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  Just had their lives ruined. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=412.76s)]
*  Your first concern? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=414.6s)]
*  Is it somebody's falsely accused? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=415.72s)]
*  Don't tell me what my first concern is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=417.56s)]
*  And thrusts him into the national conversation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  You had three apparently well-to-do white lacrosse players accused of raping a poor black [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=422.68s)]
*  stripper single mother in Durham. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=429.88s)]
*  If you hadn't had that racial element, there's no way this kiss could have continued for that long. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=431.24s)]
*  Defending these players at a time when, you know, the prevailing wisdom at Duke University [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=435.48s)]
*  was that these players were guilty. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=443.24s)]
*  And the idea that in America you would pursue a case against three people [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=445.08000000000004s)]
*  when the evidence suggests not that they did it, but that they didn't do it, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=449.0s)]
*  to me is beyond unconscionable. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=453.24s)]
*  And these lacrosse players were declared innocent. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=455.96s)]
*  And this was a really important moment for him because here he was taking a contrarian position [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=460.44s)]
*  against the prevailing liberal orthodoxy. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=467.24s)]
*  And he ended up being vindicated. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=471.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=474.52s)]
*  He's proven right. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=475.16s)]
*  He must be feeling pretty emboldened. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=476.52s)]
*  What does he do next? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=479.0s)]
*  He goes to Washington. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=480.84s)]
*  He goes to Capitol Hill. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=481.8s)]
*  And he ends up working for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=483.56s)]
*  Senator Sessions in the early 2010s was a pretty fringe figure in the Republican Senate Conference. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=488.28s)]
*  If you take your mind back to the 2012 election, Barack Obama beats Mitt Romney. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=498.76s)]
*  And when the Republican Party, after that election, sat down, you know, the grand figures [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=504.36s)]
*  in the party got in a room together and said, what happened? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=510.36s)]
*  What do we need to change? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=513.64s)]
*  Et cetera. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=514.84s)]
*  Their famous autopsy basically said, we need to be nicer to immigrants. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=516.12s)]
*  We need to do more to reach out to Hispanics. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=521.16s)]
*  And that was the prevailing wisdom on Capitol Hill among Republicans. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=523.96s)]
*  The idea was broaden the tent. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=528.28s)]
*  We can win elections if we bring Latinos into our coalition. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=530.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=535.0s)]
*  But very specifically by being more compassionate, quote unquote, when it came to immigration, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=535.48s)]
*  that sentiment became operationalized in Congress. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=543.24s)]
*  So what you had was the so-called Gang of Eight, which was a bipartisan group of senators [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=548.44s)]
*  who got together and figured out a pathway to comprehensive immigration reform. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=554.36s)]
*  And you had Republicans like Marco Rubio played a really significant role in this bill. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=561.48s)]
*  So they came up with legislation that sought a pathway to citizenship for millions of people [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=568.04s)]
*  who are in the country illegally. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  And they also took some measures to tighten border security. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=578.04s)]
*  And Stephen Miller and Jeff Sessions identified this bill as the big fight that they were going [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=582.28s)]
*  to wage for the future of the party, for the future of the country. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=589.48s)]
*  And Stephen Miller became kind of famous in Washington circles for haranguing reporters [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=593.9599999999999s)]
*  late at night with emails, with lurid stories about immigrants committing crimes, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=601.88s)]
*  for working behind the scenes with conservative media, for working every lawmaker he could. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=607.88s)]
*  And it really was a sort of David and Goliath in terms of the politics of it in Washington and the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=612.92s)]
*  money. So even Miller and Jeff Sessions at that time were very much a minority voice in the party [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  among the elites in Washington, but they were far more in tune with the Republican voters, with the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=624.92s)]
*  base. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=631.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. It sounds like they are betting at this point, Miller and Sessions, that while there is [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=631.88s)]
*  a consensus among the Republican establishment that this is the right way to go, that they [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=637.56s)]
*  actually know what voters care about and that this bill would not be popular with the base of voters [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=643.56s)]
*  that they're trying to win over. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=650.04s)]
*  Yes. And they were right. Because once they activated this opposition movement, these [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  lawmakers in the House, their phones were being lit up by angry voters, angry constituents saying, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=659.0799999999999s)]
*  do not do this. And the bill never went through the House. So they killed it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=665.0s)]
*  So this is a huge victory for Miller, another instance in which it's him against the world in [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=669.88s)]
*  what you said was this kind of uphill battle. He comes out on top. And yet, Republicans in his [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=675.16s)]
*  own party, it sounds like, are still swatting him away like a fly. I mean, he's still an outsider, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=682.12s)]
*  even among conservatives at this point. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=689.56s)]
*  No question. The Washington Republican establishment at that time saw Stephen Miller [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=692.9200000000001s)]
*  as an irritant and dismissed him. And it's interesting now, when my colleagues Maggie [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=698.76s)]
*  Haberman, Charlie Savage, David Farenhold and myself reported out this story, you talk to people [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  who were in influential positions back then, they can't believe where he's ended up. But that all [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=711.5600000000001s)]
*  changed when Donald Trump launched his campaign for president in 2015. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=719.1600000000001s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=725.96s)]
*  Well, it was almost a religious experience for him watching Donald Trump come down that escalator. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=727.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=733.32s)]
*  Jeff Sessions was his vehicle at that time. But Jeff Sessions does not have the charisma to be [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=734.2800000000001s)]
*  a true national figure. Jeff Sessions was never going to win the presidency. Here is this celebrity [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump, every American knows who he is, gives this speech where he says that Mexico is [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=749.48s)]
*  sending rapists across the border. I mean, Stephen Miller could have written that speech. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=755.88s)]
*  And it's this moment of exhilaration for Stephen Miller. He didn't know Donald Trump at that point, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=761.1600000000001s)]
*  he wasn't wired into his inner circle. But he starts over a period of months, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  getting in touch with Donald Trump's team, offering ideas. And eventually, he gets [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=775.96s)]
*  absorbed onto the Donald Trump team. And they see immediately his value. He would stay up all night [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=782.76s)]
*  writing speeches. This was his whole life. It was all he cared about. He was obsessed, particularly [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=789.64s)]
*  with the immigration issue, but obsessed with getting Donald Trump elected. And so he became [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=796.6s)]
*  this indispensable figure for Donald Trump. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=801.32s)]
*  It's interesting. It's like in Trump, Miller finds this ideological soulmate in a way, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=804.28s)]
*  and a guy who can really help move his vision from the fringes to the mainstream. And in Miller, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=811.3199999999999s)]
*  Trump finds a workhorse who is willing to stay up all night and design a kind of campaign that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=817.72s)]
*  appeals to voters. Exactly. And, you know, the other element was [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=827.16s)]
*  Trump trusts him. Trump has always been very paranoid about leakers around him. And he's [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=833.72s)]
*  never seen Stephen that way. He's always viewed Stephen as someone he can completely trust. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=841.08s)]
*  Okay, so Donald Trump obviously wins. How does Miller start to put his imprint on the first term? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=846.84s)]
*  So Miller comes into government, he really doesn't know a lot about how the federal government works. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  He's super aggressive. He wants to get things done. He wants to close the border and expel [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=858.84s)]
*  immigrants and do all the things that they've been talking about on the campaign, but [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=865.32s)]
*  does not necessarily have the wherewithal at that time to execute. One of the early stumbles was [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=870.2800000000001s)]
*  the travel ban against Muslim majority countries. It was very sloppily drafted, poorly coordinated, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=876.84s)]
*  and it ended up being struck down. Right. They had to redraft it. They implement the infamous [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=883.64s)]
*  zero tolerance policy, where they separate parents from their children at the border. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=889.72s)]
*  But after a period of bad media coverage, Donald Trump reverses that order. And that was something [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=895.8s)]
*  that Stephen Miller had advocated for. And so Stephen Miller found himself thwarted at many [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  levels throughout the first couple of years of the presidency. But by 2020, he had really [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=909.16s)]
*  gotten his footing. He'd learned a lot about where the levers of power were in the government. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=916.04s)]
*  And by the end, they used COVID to effectively seal the southern border. They implement [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  Title 42, which is to declare a public health emergency at the border, which basically gave [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=933.3199999999999s)]
*  them the ability to immediately turn people back. It would be hard to overstate the impact of that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=939.8s)]
*  policy. I mean, it literally reshaped the immigration system. Completely. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=945.4s)]
*  For Miller, it sounds like this first term is kind of a mixed bag, right? I mean, he has [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=951.7199999999999s)]
*  a lot of success, as you just said, in reshaping some of the rules of the game on the issue he [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=956.3599999999999s)]
*  cares most about, immigration. But at the same time, his lack of West Wing experience and know-how [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=960.44s)]
*  gets in the way of achieving his full vision. That's right. And when Donald Trump leaves office [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=967.8800000000001s)]
*  in early 2021, Stephen Miller gets to work for the next four years, planning what they would do in a [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=974.36s)]
*  second term if he ever retook the presidency, and planning how they would get through any and all [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=983.72s)]
*  obstruction from the left for this return to power. We'll be right back. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=991.0s)]
*  S1 GILLER [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1013.72s)]
*  Jonathan, what did Miller do exactly during those four years to put himself in a position [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1020.9200000000001s)]
*  to more effectively execute his vision? So Stephen Miller does a few things. One is he [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1025.88s)]
*  starts a nonprofit called America First Legal. And what he does with this group is he basically [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1032.2s)]
*  builds in his mind the right wing version of the ACLU. He had spent the previous four years [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1039.24s)]
*  in frustration with very effective left leaning groups, sued the Trump administration on all sorts [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1047.48s)]
*  of policy areas. And Stephen Miller wanted to create a version of that on the right. But the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1055.56s)]
*  most important thing he did immediately after they left office was he demonstrated his undying loyalty [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1060.68s)]
*  to Donald Trump. Remember, when Trump left office, he was a pariah. He was a defeated president, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1067.4s)]
*  but also an impeached president twice over and came close to being convicted by the Senate. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1077.0s)]
*  Many people wanted to move on from him. They saw him as the past, not the future. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1084.44s)]
*  And at this moment of abandonment- Joining me now, former senior advisor to Trump, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1088.52s)]
*  Stephen Miller. Stephen Miller very publicly showed that he never left Donald Trump's side. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1094.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, the president did a stellar job and all credit goes to him. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1101.72s)]
*  He went on television praising Trump, defending Trump. The treatment Donald Trump has gotten, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1107.96s)]
*  one false allegation after another, one investigation after another. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1114.04s)]
*  He made very clear that he wasn't going anywhere. This was one of the president's [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1118.6000000000001s)]
*  signature achievements. And when he's on TV, he's defending Trump, but he's also pushing forward [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1123.48s)]
*  his immigration agenda. We bequeathed the most secure border in US history. He went on Fox News. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1130.2s)]
*  Seal the border, deport all the illegals. He spoke at conservative conferences. That's the short [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1137.8s)]
*  answer, right? And he made sure that an anti-immigration perspective and a pro-Trump [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1144.3600000000001s)]
*  perspective were staying front and center among conservatives. The military has the right to [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1150.28s)]
*  establish a fortress position on the border and to say no one can cross here at all. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1156.04s)]
*  And the closer to the election we got, the more specific he got in his plans. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1163.8s)]
*  And the last thing Stephen Miller does is he leverages his credibility [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1172.6s)]
*  and his connection to Trump to build relationships. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1176.68s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1179.8s)]
*  Well, there's two elements to it. So number one is on Capitol Hill. Stephen Miller knows that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1181.3200000000002s)]
*  he's going to need a lot of money to do what Donald Trump calls the largest deportation [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1188.2s)]
*  operation in American history. That involves building massive detention camps in the desert [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1195.24s)]
*  to hold migrants while you're waiting to fly them out of the country. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1202.44s)]
*  It involves a huge amount of resources to round up immigrants, arrest them. So he very methodically [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1207.24s)]
*  builds relationships in the Republican House and in the Republican Senate. The second category that [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1216.44s)]
*  was really important is rich people. He builds incredible donor relationships and raises a ton [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1222.3600000000001s)]
*  of money for the nonprofit, more than $40 million. But there's a quiet relationship that he builds [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1230.2s)]
*  that only became visible pretty recently and he still is very secretive about it. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1237.0s)]
*  And that's his relationship with Elon Musk. So Musk had been very secretive about his political [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1243.56s)]
*  spending. He did not want people knowing what he was up to, but he was secretly funding a bunch of [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1251.0800000000002s)]
*  advertising against transgender rights and other issues. And Stephen Miller's group was associated [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1256.84s)]
*  with this spending. So he was operating in secrecy as an advisor, political donations advisor [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1266.04s)]
*  to Elon Musk. And that relationship became super important as Musk then became [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1274.84s)]
*  all in for Trump, spent more money than anyone else trying to elect Donald Trump. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1282.84s)]
*  Jonathan, it's not lost on me, obviously, that this guy who was made fun of at one point in [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1288.2s)]
*  Washington is now making friends in high places and really cultivating the kinds of allies that he [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1294.44s)]
*  needs. I mean, the richest guy in the world, for example, to make sure that he can wield his power [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1302.04s)]
*  efficiently. It sounds like he is actively trying to make up for strategic holes that may have been [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1307.88s)]
*  there in the first term. That's right. The first advantage Stephen Miller had in the four years [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  out of power was he had a plan. He had the space to work on policy plans. And that was really evident [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1320.2s)]
*  to me when myself, Charlie Savage and Maggie Haberman did this big story in late 2023 on [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1328.7600000000002s)]
*  Trump's immigration plans. And we did an extensive interview with Stephen Miller. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1335.88s)]
*  And if you go back and read our story in New York Times, copy paste, copy paste. And it's what you're [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1341.0s)]
*  seeing right now. He had a fully formed vision. And it is exactly what they're doing right now. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1346.7600000000002s)]
*  So he had the plan, but he also had these big thoughts of execution that were really important. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1354.1200000000001s)]
*  It's what I'll just call flood the zone. His idea of flood the zone is you do so many things at once, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1360.52s)]
*  so many aggressive, controversial actions at once at speed, that your opposition is scattered and [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1367.16s)]
*  almost defenseless. When it's one of 50 or 100 actions that are extremely controversial, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1375.96s)]
*  there's only so much bandwidth for the opposition to muster resistance, muster resources, muster [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1382.76s)]
*  outrage, muster legal action. So you just flood the zone. You do so many things at once that your [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1389.16s)]
*  opposition, they might stop some of them, but they can't stop all of them. Overwhelm, overwhelm, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1395.0s)]
*  overwhelm. Okay. But Jonathan, I think it's worth noting that just last week, Miller's strategy [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1401.0s)]
*  ran into something of a wall. This federal judge knocked down the executive order, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1407.3200000000002s)]
*  ending birthright citizenship. The judge said, I'm quoting here, I've been on the bench for over four [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1412.3600000000001s)]
*  decades. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order. Where were the lawyers when this decision [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1417.88s)]
*  was being made? So I'm wondering, does this mirror the sloppiness of the Muslim ban in the first term? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1423.48s)]
*  Does it raise questions for you about whether Miller's four years of preparation did actually [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1431.4s)]
*  put him in a better position to execute his vision? No, I don't think this has anything to do with [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1437.16s)]
*  sloppiness. They knew this was going to get challenged in court. They knew that this was [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1442.44s)]
*  radical, audacious policy. So this is not a matter of sloppiness. This is a matter of them [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1447.96s)]
*  testing the limits and seeing what they can get away with very deliberately. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1453.4s)]
*  Is that part of the flood the zone strategy? It is. I mean, look, they know that some of the [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1457.3200000000002s)]
*  actions they're taking are not going to pass legal muster. That's a feature, not a bug. They're doing [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1464.04s)]
*  so many things at once to crack down on immigrants, to deport immigrants, to block immigrants from [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1469.24s)]
*  entering the country that the aggregate is going to be hugely restrictive, even if certain individual [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1475.4s)]
*  actions fail in the courts. Okay, we're just at the start, obviously, of this administration. But [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1482.84s)]
*  when I think about what the likelihood of Miller having success here long term is, I have to ask [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1488.68s)]
*  about something that you mentioned earlier, which is the potential for moderating forces [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1497.0s)]
*  within Trump world, people that oppose some of his agenda. Do those people still exist? Are those [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1503.64s)]
*  forces still there? No. If people are searching for internal opposition in the West Wing to [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1511.32s)]
*  the Trump-Steven Miller ideology, you're not going to find them. They don't exist anymore. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1519.88s)]
*  Where you will find obstacles are in Congress. Republicans have very tight majorities, and we've [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1526.28s)]
*  already seen how dysfunctional the House Republican majority is. And so there's real questions there. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1532.28s)]
*  You'll find obstruction potentially in the court system. It's not a given that all their policies [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1539.16s)]
*  will sail through. Frankly, if you're looking for restraint on Steven Miller's maximalist [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1545.64s)]
*  impulses on immigration in particular, it's Donald Trump. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1556.52s)]
*  Donald Trump is the restraining force on Steven Miller? Yeah. Really? How so? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1561.64s)]
*  Well, he's not as hardcore as Steven Miller is on immigration. Trump is very sensitive to [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1567.8s)]
*  the stock market. He does not want to see the stock market tank under his tenure. And if there [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1574.2s)]
*  are actions on immigration that would cause inflation, deporting farm workers and others, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1581.0s)]
*  that's something that's going to really make Trump think twice about following through. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1588.68s)]
*  And the other one is media coverage. We saw in Term 1, he did not tolerate that period of [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1594.3600000000001s)]
*  really aggressive, wrenching media coverage, particularly on television about family separation, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1600.6799999999998s)]
*  these horrible images of crying children and what have you. And so Trump backed off that policy. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1606.4399999999998s)]
*  So Trump, in combination with the stock market and media as his own guardrails, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1612.52s)]
*  is actually probably the closest thing you have to a restraint on the full Steven Miller ideology. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1620.12s)]
*  And how does Miller respond when Trump is not fully aligned with him, when they disagree? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1628.76s)]
*  With complete deference. And I'll give you the perfect example of that. There's been this huge [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1635.4799999999998s)]
*  debate on the right recently about H-1B visas, these high school visas, the tech companies [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1640.4399999999998s)]
*  love to bring in smart engineers and what have you from overseas. Steven Miller has spent a good [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1646.1999999999998s)]
*  deal of his adult life rallying against these visas, but Donald Trump supports them. And from [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1651.8799999999999s)]
*  all accounts, Steven Miller has done very little, if anything, to try to dissuade Trump from that [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1659.1599999999999s)]
*  position recently. So I often find when I meet people who never interacted with Steven Miller, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1665.0s)]
*  they've only consumed him through Fox News or whatever. They have an impression of him that he [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1670.44s)]
*  is this fire breather, kamikaze pilot, my way or the highway, fight to the death, whatever. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1674.6s)]
*  Actually, the opposite, extremely pragmatic, a very canny political survivor. You don't survive [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1683.7199999999998s)]
*  as long as he has in Trump's inner circle without being like that, because the person you're working [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1691.9599999999998s)]
*  for, Donald Trump, does not really have firm principles or firm ideology. He's completely [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1697.56s)]
*  transactional. He's got a few gut impulses. And if you think that you can shift him on everything, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1703.32s)]
*  you turn out like Steve Bannon. You don't stay in his inner staff circle. So he has learned how to [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1712.2s)]
*  operate in Trump world and how to survive in Trump world. And that's why he is one of the originals [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1720.9199999999998s)]
*  who still remains and is one of the most effective members of the current staff. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1727.08s)]
*  Jonathan, I have to say, just thinking about Miller's bio, that guy, the guy who kind of backs down [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1733.6399999999999s)]
*  from a fight, who concedes strategically, he's come a long way from the high schooler who was this [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1740.9199999999998s)]
*  strident ideological warrior who, in some cases, was starting fights to make a point, to go against [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1748.12s)]
*  the grain. He's a different person. His gut remains the same, but he's learned a lot. He's learned [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1755.0s)]
*  a lot about how to get what he wants. And knowing that you're not going to get everything you want, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1762.84s)]
*  and knowing that you might have to set aside a fight for the moment because the person that [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1769.96s)]
*  is most important to you, Donald Trump, may not agree, and you know that you're a staffer and you [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1776.28s)]
*  work for him. And he's not going to get everything he wants this term, but he's going to learn. He's [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1781.4s)]
*  going to keep learning. And he might be blocked here or he might be blocked there. But if there's [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1789.0s)]
*  one thing that we know about him by this point, it's that he won't stop. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1795.64s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you so much. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1802.2s)]

*  On Sunday, the immigration crackdown that Miller helped craft continued to take shape. The president [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1811.16s)]

*  administration created a process to treat Colombian migrants with, quote, dignity and respect. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1829.48s)]
*  In response, Trump threatened a barrage of retaliatory measures against the country, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1836.28s)]
*  including sanctions and 25 percent tariffs on all Colombian imports. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1840.52s)]
*  Late Sunday night, the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, backed down and agreed to let [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1845.48s)]
*  deportation flights into the country. The White House said in a statement that because the [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRSYSPp1fk&t=1850.04s)]
