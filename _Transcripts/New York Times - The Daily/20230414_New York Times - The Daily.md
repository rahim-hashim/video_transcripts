# Broadwayâ€™s Longest-Running Musical Turns Out the Lights
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6jBJLpcCNE)
*  Thank you.
*  So we've just arrived at the Majestic Theatre where the crew is getting the set ready for
*  this afternoon's matinee.
*  Of course as soon as you walk into this unbelievably beautiful and completely empty theatre, the
*  first thing you see is the chandelier which is hanging over the centre orchestra.
*  The chandelier of course is the icon of this show.
*  It famously sort of crashes over the audience at the end of the first act.
*  Mic checks as the sound crew is making sure that everything works.
*  They've checked the lights, they've checked the speakers.
*  It's all starting to happen.
*  All coming together.
*  Good afternoon and welcome to Phantom of the Opera.
*  The house is now open.
*  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.
*  Step on down to guitar.
*  Can you help me find your seat please?
*  Welcome to Phantom.
*  Thank you.
*  That's going to be row E on the right side.
*  So the lights are going down.
*  The crowd is super pumped for this.
*  Thank you.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  In Midtown Manhattan on Sunday, Phantom of the Opera, the longest running show in the
*  history of Broadway, will close its doors after more than three decades.
*  Today, the story of the show's meteoric rise, stunning longevity and bittersweet closing.
*  My colleagues, theatre reporter Michael Paulson and daily producers Sydney Harper and Eric
*  Krupke, take us backstage during one of Phantom's final performances.
*  It's Friday, April 14th.
*  It's funny, it's actually a lot louder back here than I expected.
*  Hi, I'm Greg.
*  This is Greg.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Thank you so much for having me.
*  Of course.
*  Can I just get you saying your name and your title just for the tape?
*  Sure.
*  My name is Greg Lovoti and I'm the production stage manager.
*  How long have you been here?
*  About ten and a half years.
*  Wow.
*  You guys must have all of this memorized.
*  Do you hear it in your sleep?
*  Yeah.
*  I joke a lot that I could do every line in the show, but I could only do it if I was
*  saying every single line.
*  Just straight down.
*  So where are we right now exactly?
*  So we're in the trap room under the stage.
*  So all these trap doors are about to open up as we go into the Phantom's lair.
*  How big is the crew here as compared to other shows?
*  It takes over 125 human beings backstage to do this show every day.
*  Now that includes cast and orchestra, but it's an unheard of amount of people this
*  day and age.
*  How many shows have you managed?
*  I'd say it's in the high 2000s, almost 3000 performances.
*  Before this job, my longest job was like 51 weeks.
*  And even the 51 week job is cushy.
*  I think we have this habit in this industry of always looking ahead to what's next, what's
*  next, what's next.
*  Because we're conditioned that our employment is temporary no matter what.
*  Every show closes.
*  This is the perfect example.
*  Something you think would run forever and it's going to close.
*  Michael, it feels like there are certain truisms about living in this city, immutable facts
*  of being a resident of New York City.
*  The first one that comes to mind is there's going to be traffic in Times Square.
*  The second is that the pizza here is not as good as everyone says it is.
*  New Haven's better.
*  And the third is that if you want to go see Phantom of the Opera on Broadway, it's always
*  going to be available to you.
*  It's a permanent piece of the architecture of the city.
*  And now you're telling me that one of these things is no longer true.
*  Right.
*  And I guess I'm not supposed to choose the pizza.
*  You're not supposed to choose the pizza.
*  It's a moment that those of us who spend our lives immersed in theater never thought was
*  going to happen.
*  The Phantom of the Opera is closing.
*  It's like it was a show that was going to last forever.
*  And for all intents and purposes, it has.
*  How many years exactly has Phantom been on Broadway?
*  It hit 35 years in January.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, by the time Phantom closes on Sunday, that's going to be the 13,981st performance.
*  It has been seen by 20 million people and it's made $1.4 billion.
*  I have to admit that while awed by its longevity, I don't know all that much about Phantom the
*  show.
*  And I love musical theater.
*  You know that, Michael.
*  You and I have actually been to shows together.
*  And the thing about Phantom is there was no rush to go see it because it was always going
*  to be there.
*  So I need you to walk me through and help me understand exactly what it is that I've
*  missed and why the show is so integral to musical theater.
*  Let's just start with the show's birth, when it arrives in New York and opens.
*  What does the world of musical theater look like when Phantom comes here?
*  Phantom arrives at sort of an inflection point both for Broadway and for New York City.
*  The 70s were a really rough decade.
*  A lot of people were moving out of the city.
*  There was quite a bit of crime, particularly in Times Square, which of course is where
*  Broadway is located.
*  It's where we're located.
*  And where we are located.
*  And the art form of musical theater was facing a kind of existential crisis.
*  The number of theaters is going down.
*  The number of shows being produced is low.
*  The neighborhood in which Broadway is located is troubled.
*  New York itself is troubled.
*  And the future is unclear.
*  But at the same time, these musicals from England start to arrive as something that
*  is sometimes called the British Invasion.
*  And what are those shows?
*  Well in 1979 comes Aveda.
*  And wait, we're going to fly right by Aveda without like even a ballad?
*  Don't fly the Argentina.
*  The truth is I never left you.
*  I mean look, I skipped Joseph in which I know you played a part in your childhood.
*  Do you want to perform a little bit?
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Okay, go ahead.
*  And in 1982.
*  There's Cats.
*  And the central figure in this British Invasion is this composer named Andrew Lloyd Webber.
*  He's the guy who famously wrote the music for Joseph, for Aveda, for Cats.
*  And at some point in the mid-80s, he stumbles into a used bookstore and picks up a copy
*  of this 1910 novel, The Phantom of the Opera.
*  And it's in reading that novel that he starts to think seriously about turning this classic
*  story into a musical.
*  And he does.
*  And he does.
*  And just remind us, Michael, of the basic plot of this show that Andrew Lloyd Webber
*  conjures from this novel.
*  It might be embarrassing to ask for this plot, but I need it.
*  Sure.
*  The Phantom of the Opera is kind of a gothic romance set in 19th century Paris.
*  It tells the story of this disfigured artistic genius, that's of course the Phantom, who
*  lives holed up underneath the Paris Opera House.
*  And he becomes obsessed with this young soprano named Christine.
*  You alone can make my song take flight.
*  The Phantom has been tutoring and nurturing and championing Christine so that she can
*  lead this opera company, but also homicidal in his obsession with her.
*  He's kind of a hidden controller of this opera house.
*  He's extorting money from the guys who own it.
*  Ultimately, Christine falls in love with a childhood friend and decides to marry him.
*  And the Phantom, furious, kidnaps her.
*  A mob chases the Phantom and Christine into his lair.
*  And then he vanishes, magically, just ahead of this group of people coming to get him.
*  He vanishes with this magical stage effect, leaving behind just the iconic mask.
*  So that's the basic plot.
*  The musical opens in London in 1986, and then two years later, it arrives here in New York
*  on Broadway in 1988.
*  And it's been here ever since.
*  And what is the critical response to this show when it opens in New York?
*  Well...
*  You're laughing.
*  I'm laughing.
*  I mean, I've gone back a few times to read the review in the New York Times by Frank
*  Rich, who was then the theater critic for the paper and sometimes known as the butcher
*  of Broadway.
*  Right, right.
*  He writes, it may be possible to have a terrible time at the Phantom of the Opera, but you'll
*  have to work at it.
*  Backhanded compliment.
*  Indeed.
*  The review is, I would say, kind of contemptuous of its elements.
*  But it acknowledges that it's effective.
*  And what did audiences make of it?
*  Audiences loved it before the first performance.
*  There were lines overnight outside the theater to buy tickets.
*  There is something about the show that has enraptured audiences and did so from the beginning.
*  Help me understand that.
*  I mean, I wonder if there's a moment or a song that captures what it is that has people
*  camped out waiting for tickets and falling in love with the show in a way that our colleague
*  Frank Rich did not.
*  I mean, there are a few moments in the show that I think no one who has seen it ever forgets.
*  There's the crashing chandelier, there's the masquerade ball.
*  But I think for many of us, it's when they sing the title song, The Phantom of the Opera,
*  while the Phantom is rowing Christine across his subterranean lake to his lair.
*  And it's like misty and magical.
*  Christine, she hits this high E that feels like it could shatter a mirror.
*  As all of this is becoming a cultural phenomenon in that opening year, just how big a hit does
*  Phantom become?
*  Look, it's huge.
*  Everyone who has seen this musical comes away enchanted.
*  Andrew Lloyd Webber is on the cover of Time Magazine.
*  The show is selling out.
*  There's no question Phantom of the Opera is the entertainment event of the year.
*  And a few months after opening.
*  Welcome to the 1988 Tony Awards.
*  It completely dominates at the Tony Awards, which are the biggest annual awards for Broadway.
*  And the winner is The Phantom of the Opera.
*  It wins seven, including the biggest one, which is for Best New Musical.
*  So more or less a clean sweep.
*  Definitely.
*  It's not only selling out in New York, but it's now touring the United States.
*  And the show itself is so big and so spectacular that theaters have to expand their buildings
*  to accommodate it.
*  It is breathing new life into the touring industry.
*  And of course, in New York, it's kind of a bridge between a Broadway that was an existential
*  crisis for the art form and the industry to an era when musical theater is once again
*  popular.
*  Look, Broadway is an incredibly failure prone industry.
*  Almost 75% of shows flame out.
*  Musicals are lucky to run three to five years and 35 years is completely unheard of.
*  So I've been thinking a lot over the last few months about Phantom's longevity.
*  And one way of thinking about that is to talk to the people involved with the show.
*  And so when the Daily's producers and I went to spend a day backstage, we visited with
*  so many members of the company, cast and crew, just asked them what it has meant to spend
*  so much of their lives working on this single piece of art and how they're feeling now that
*  it's coming to an end.
*  All right.
*  You ready?
*  I'm ready.
*  Tell me your name.
*  Marie Johnson.
*  Marie Johnson.
*  And what do you do at Phantom of the Opera?
*  I do Madame Girry.
*  I play Madame Girry.
*  So one thing that really interested me about you is early in your career, you were Christine,
*  the ingenious student.
*  Now you are Madame Girry, who is Christine's teacher, instructor, patron.
*  Yeah.
*  What is it like?
*  The whole age of the show has carried through your life.
*  Yeah.
*  It's art replicating life in a way because I was green when I was cast as Christine.
*  I was a young performer.
*  It was my second show.
*  So it wasn't hard to do in that sense, tapping into who she was.
*  And now same life has moved on and I know a lot more.
*  And I sort of try to bring that history now to Madame Girry, a little darker side, a little
*  wiser.
*  You know, we call ourselves the Phantom family.
*  You know, and families are protective and safe spaces.
*  They're also sometimes a little dysfunctional.
*  So it's truly that.
*  And what just feels like, what feels distinct and special about this show, especially like,
*  you know, there's nothing else like it, I guess.
*  There's nothing else like it.
*  No, just the sense of family between everybody here.
*  And it's a family with a pH.
*  I used to like hate that term and now I kind of love it.
*  It's very, very significant to my life.
*  I have two children that were born into the show.
*  They don't know any difference.
*  Currently, it's kind of a lot of my identity.
*  It's like when you get married and you join a family that has a ton of history together,
*  I'm sort of like the new wife in the family.
*  But you've been embraced, do you think?
*  Totally.
*  It's theater folk, so it's like, there's a lot of heart here.
*  The other day, I came off stage and I just stood in the wings and I totally just had
*  tears streaming down my face.
*  That sounds so corny, but it's true because it was the same feeling that I had when I
*  was four.
*  Now watching that and what that means on stage, these audiences are so nuts because they all
*  have that same thing.
*  And I have it too because I'm a theater nerd at the end of the day and a Phantom nerd.
*  Follow there.
*  A little tight.
*  The first act has just ended and the crew now has 13 minutes to remake the set for the
*  opening of Act 2, which is the famous masquerade scene.
*  Sort of with our toes up here, that way there's room for people to pass behind us.
*  As the production stage manager, luckily the 13 minutes of intermission are my closest
*  thing to a break that I ever get in the show.
*  Yeah, I mean, being a part of something this big and this long, when you're standing back
*  here, when you do get a moment, what are you thinking, what's going through your mind?
*  Just trying to take a mental snapshot.
*  Whatever one moment looks like or sounds like or even smells like.
*  We have a lot of pyrotechnics in the show and they each have their own unique afterburn
*  type smell and I can, by smelling each of those effects, I know which point in the show
*  we're in.
*  Hopefully when I'm later on in my career and hopefully people will still want to know about
*  this and ask about it and maybe hopefully this is something that can continue to be
*  celebrated and thought of for a while.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Michael, why is Phantom closing?
*  spectacular, seemingly unbreakable juggernaut of a musical theatre production finally leaving?
*  Look, I mean, the bottom line is that everything runs its course and Phantom was not exempt
*  from the laws of gravity.
*  It just took longer.
*  The truth is that Phantom has had some brushes with death over the years.
*  It's had periods when it's been doing really well and periods when it's struggling.
*  When you went pre-pandemic, there was an amazing number of people who were non-English speakers
*  in the audience and it was kind of a landmark for global travelers.
*  It was in all the guidebooks and then the pandemic arrived.
*  Broadway was closed for a year and a half and Phantom comes back in the fall of 2021
*  but pretty quickly attendance starts to flag and by 2022 Phantom is having more losing
*  weeks than winning weeks.
*  Right, and there's not a lot of tolerance for that when it comes to Broadway.
*  You're saying the death bell is starting to gently toll.
*  It's bad and Phantom has some unique vulnerabilities.
*  I mean, first of all, Phantom is a big show.
*  It has a lot of performers.
*  It has a lot of musicians and it has a very big and elaborate set but it's also really
*  expensive and we're living in an inflationary environment.
*  Costs are rising and producers decide they need to move on.
*  And I have to imagine those economic issues aside that after all these decades, the show
*  has possibly also run its artistic course, right?
*  I mean, taste change.
*  Yeah, I mean, you're setting a trap for me here.
*  Of course.
*  Am I?
*  I mean, absolutely.
*  Taste change, artistic forms change, but sure, it was old fashioned when it opened.
*  I mean, it's set in the 19th century.
*  Its fundamental musical form is opera and the kind of grandiosity of everything about
*  it is not the aesthetic of 2023.
*  And what do you mean?
*  What is in your mind the aesthetic of 2023 on Broadway?
*  Sure, I've been thinking a lot about this question.
*  I mean, I think in many ways, Broadway now is sort of bifurcated between two kind of
*  competing forms of performance.
*  Where do you want to begin?
*  From the top?
*  Places!
*  One is this giant branded show.
*  This begins with adaptations of movies.
*  And now we think more about jukebox musicals, which are musicals that are adapted from the
*  song catalogs of pop stars.
*  And five, six, seven, come on!
*  So I'm thinking about MJ, which is about Michael Jackson.
*  So please put your hands together for Marit's debut.
*  And Tina, which is about Tina Turner.
*  Whoa, what's love got to do, got to do with it?
*  Of course, most famously, Jersey Boys.
*  You're from my neighborhood, you got three ways out.
*  You could join the army, you could get mobbed up, or you could become a star.
*  There are a ton of musicals arriving on Broadway kind of pre-branded with very familiar stories
*  or stars or songs.
*  Right, this is a newer variety of show designed to be commercially successful, not considered
*  the great craftsmanship of Broadway.
*  Yeah, some of them are super fun, some of them are good, a lot of the performances are
*  excellent.
*  But they're probably not the shows that are moving the art form forward.
*  That's the other vein of show that is happening now.
*  And those are musicals that are really different from Phantom.
*  The musicals that I'm thinking about now are often intimate and psychological and much
*  more focused on storytelling, lyrics, character.
*  Thinking about shows like Dear Evan Hansen.
*  Next to Normal.
*  Fun Home, these are shows that are much smaller in scale than Phantom.
*  They are naturalistic, they are grappling with contemporary issues, they are prioritizing
*  storytelling over stagecraft.
*  Right, and the content is harder.
*  Fun Home, I saw it, that's a show about a young lesbian artist revisiting her childhood
*  and the death of her closeted father.
*  That is not Phantom of the Opera.
*  No, Phantom has its own darkness, but its darkness is mythic and the darkness of these
*  shows is much more familiar.
*  It's the darkness of our neighbors.
*  Look to the show that won the Tony most recently.
*  It's called A Strange Loop.
*  And it couldn't be more different than Phantom of the Opera.
*  It's about a young, aspiring musical theater artist who is grappling with a sense that
*  he just doesn't fit into the worlds he wants to be part of.
*  Broadway, gay culture in New York, his own family.
*  Yeah, look, it's raw, it's painful, it's moving, it's provocative, challenging in
*  all kinds of contemporary ways that tell us a little bit about how the art form and how
*  Broadway have changed in the decades since Phantom arrived.
*  Well, stay with that.
*  I mean, what does a journey that takes you from a Tony Award for Phantom in 1988 to a
*  Tony Award for A Strange Loop last year, what does that tell us about the evolution of musical
*  theater and about we, the consumer of musical theater and what we now demand from the art
*  form?
*  I think part of what is being celebrated on Broadway and in theater today is people's
*  ability to see themselves represented on stage.
*  These stories are not the kind of mythic fables of Phantom.
*  They are the stories of our contemporaries wrestling with the challenges of modern life.
*  And that's undeniably a very healthy evolution because this is a Broadway, this is a musical
*  theater that better reflects modern reality and its complexities.
*  And yet, this evolution means that the show that the critics love and that the industry
*  crowns is the best is probably not going to have the same appeal as a show like Phantom.
*  Shows like Fun Home, A Strange Loop, their appeal is narrower.
*  So does Phantom closing bring us to a moment in musical theater where the idea of a universally
*  accessible hit with the craftsmanship of prestige theater is perhaps a little bit in danger?
*  I mean, of course, all of us have been talking for some years about the atomization of taste,
*  right?
*  And when you think about film or television or pop music or theater, there is no longer
*  a kind of consensus about what we all like.
*  We don't all like anything anymore.
*  Every show aspires to be universal and both Fun Home and A Strange Loop and everything
*  else talks about the universality of its themes, even if its characters are really specific.
*  But the marketplace is telling you that there's something about your premise that is correct
*  because Phantom has made $6 billion globally and A Strange Loop closed at a loss on Broadway.
*  Despite winning the Tony.
*  So this is leaving a hole on Broadway, literally, figuratively, aesthetically, and what do we
*  think is going to fill it?
*  Yeah, like the majestic theater, this grand, fantastic building, one of only 41 theaters
*  on Broadway, has been locked up by Phantom and something new is going to go in there.
*  And in a way, that's like a symbol for where we are on Broadway.
*  Like we don't get to know what's ahead.
*  How do you think musical theater has changed?
*  There's a broader palette to choose from.
*  You know, it was so striking when we were backstage talking to Kast and Koo, I expected
*  to encounter a lot of tears and...
*  We're getting a newer audience, different audiences, a more diverse audience.
*  It's sad it's closing, but it will make way.
*  It'll pave the way for new creative input to this story.
*  I think that's a great thing.
*  People were really not bereft.
*  They were kind of sanguine.
*  They were reflective.
*  I hope these spectacle shows stay.
*  And that's what Broadway is.
*  Broadway is big.
*  It's, you know, it's size.
*  It's important to be able to experience something like that on a big scale.
*  I think, of course, they're sad that this show that they love and that has sustained
*  them for so long is coming to an end.
*  But they also love the theater and they recognize that as Phantom closes, it creates both literal
*  and metaphorical space for another work of art to come in.
*  And that's what everyone looks forward to.
*  Right.
*  As one Phantom closes, another Broadway door opens.
*  As one Phantom closes, another door opens.
*  Yeah.
*  I think Broadway is ever evolving.
*  And what we opened in 1988 has had its time.
*  It's time for there to be new things.
*  So yes, there's loss, but what's to be gained?
*  Oh, Michael, this was truly a wonderful conversation.
*  So thank you very much.
*  So fun talking to you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Today, the Justice Department arrested Jack Douglas to share up in connection with an
*  investigation into alleged unauthorized removal, retention and transmission of classified national
*  defense information.
*  On Thursday afternoon, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the arrest of a suspect
*  in the embarrassing leak of hundreds of pages of classified military intelligence over the
*  past few months.
*  FBI agents took Tishara into custody earlier this afternoon without incident.
*  The suspect, Jack Tishara, works in the intelligence unit of the Massachusetts National Guard and
*  led an online group where many of the secret documents were first shared.
*  Their disclosure has upset America's allies and exposed the weakness of the Ukrainian
*  army as it defends itself against Russia.
*  Tishara is expected to face charges under the Espionage Act, which makes it a crime
*  to distribute documents related to national defense that could be used to harm the United
*  States or help its enemies.
*  Today's episode was produced by Sydney Harper and Eric Krupke with help from Nina Feldman
*  and Claire Tennesgetter.
*  It was edited by Lexi Diao with help from Michael Benoit, contains original music by
*  Alicia Beatu, Dan Powell, Corey Schrepple, Marion Lozano and Diane Wong and was engineered
*  by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsfolk of Wonderly.
*  Special thanks to Andrew Lloyd Webber.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  See you on Monday.
