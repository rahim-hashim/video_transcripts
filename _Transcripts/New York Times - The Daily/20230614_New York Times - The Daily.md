# Arraigned, Again: Trumpâ€™s Federal Court Hearing in Miami
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpfm0ydCXY8)
*  Okay, this is Daily Producer Michael Simon Johnson.
*  I am in downtown Miami.
*  That's got to be one of the coolest looking courthouses I've seen, for sure.
*  And now I'm trying to find Luke Broadwater.
*  Oh, there he is.
*  Luke.
*  Hey, good morning.
*  How's it going?
*  Good.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  How about you?
*  I'm alright.
*  That's an actual rooster just walking around.
*  There's roosters all over.
*  There's roosters everywhere.
*  This is crazy.
*  Is this normal?
*  Where are we and what are we doing?
*  We're at the federal courthouse here in Miami on a hot June day.
*  Ridiculously hot.
*  Ridiculously hot day for the arraignment of Donald J. Trump, the first American president
*  to be arraigned on federal charges in the history of the country.
*  And you know, it's a historic day, but really a sort of a circus-like atmosphere has broken
*  out here outside the courthouse and the lawn.
*  The police force here said they were ready for a crowd of up to 50,000.
*  I don't think we're anywhere close to 50,000.
*  We're probably more about 5,000.
*  There's tents set up all over the place.
*  A lot of them are for the media, but there's also, I would say, thousands of Trump supporters
*  here.
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  It's really taken on the field, the Trump rally.
*  I mean, it's, you know, Make America Great Again hats everywhere.
*  Let's Go Brandon flags.
*  Ultra MAGA t-shirts I'm looking at.
*  We want Trump!
*  We want Trump!
*  We want Trump!
*  We want Trump!
*  We want Trump!
*  We want Trump!
*  This guy's wearing a Cuba flag and an American flag, and he's holding up, looks like a pike
*  with a pig's head through it.
*  I think that's a real, yeah, that's a real pig.
*  This guy took a real pig's head, shoved it through a stick, and is like standing here
*  talking to people.
*  There's a lot of anger, but also festivities in the air.
*  It's very much a festive mood.
*  Yeah, I would say the mood here is jovial.
*  Despite what's happening.
*  Let's Go Brandon!
*  Let's Go Brandon!
*  Let's Go Brandon!
*  Let's Go Brandon!
*  Justice for Trump!
*  Justice for Trump!
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  Today.
*  Three dispatches from the arraignment of Donald Trump on 37 federal charges over his handling
*  of classified documents.
*  Luke Broadwater was outside the courthouse in Miami.
*  Glenn Thrush was inside the courtroom.
*  And Maggie Heyerman was at Trump's home in Bedminster, New Jersey.
*  It's Wednesday, June 14th.
*  Okay we can do some interviews if you want.
*  Hi sir, we're with the New York Times.
*  New York Times, Donald.
*  Yes, I am.
*  Where?
*  I'm from Hollywood, California, but I used to be the former official ambassador of Beverly
*  Hills.
*  I flew about five hours, so I mean, I didn't get much sleep, but I'm, you know.
*  Can you briefly describe what you're wearing today?
*  Yeah, it's a tuxedo, red tuxedo, black top hat.
*  You're wearing a gold chain that says, in Trump we trust.
*  Yes.
*  And a top hat that says, we love Trump.
*  And then your sign says Trump to Santas.
*  Yes.
*  I'll tell you, you know, because if anything, if Trump were to get convicted, DeSantis,
*  I think he would win, and he could pardon him.
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  USA!
*  I challenge the next US president to pardon Donald J. Trump for these offenses in this
*  federal case.
*  And I have challenged, I have demanded that every other candidate in this race either
*  sign this commitment to pardon on January 20th, 2025, or else to explain why they are
*  not.
*  And thank you.
*  How you doing?
*  Good.
*  Over to The New York Times?
*  Well, good to see you.
*  What's your name?
*  Luke Brodner.
*  Yeah, how you doing?
*  Good, I'm Michael Johnson.
*  Michael, nice to meet you.
*  What's your name?
*  I'm Jay.
*  Uh-huh.
*  You're going to like my name, Jay Lowe.
*  Jay Lowe?
*  Yeah, that's my name.
*  L-O-W-E?
*  Yeah.
*  Like Rob Lowe?
*  Do you get that a lot?
*  Rob Lowe, or even like the Jennifer Lopez, except I'm prettier than she is.
*  Where are you from?
*  I'm from the Dallas area.
*  Oh, from Dallas?
*  So you came all the way from Dallas for this?
*  Yeah, I got to support my guy.
*  Could you describe what you're wearing?
*  You have a Trump, Take America Back, 2024 shirt and a similar hat, a red hat.
*  If I had Trump pants, I'd be wearing those too.
*  Yeah, it's like supporting your favorite football team.
*  Or I'm a Boston Red Sox fan.
*  I wear a Red Sox doll all the time.
*  But this is Trump Day, so let's put on the Trump stuff.
*  What motivates someone to travel all the way from Dallas?
*  Well, one is that I love what he did for our country when he was president.
*  He was a great guy.
*  He was a great guy.
*  He was a great guy.
*  I love what he did for our country when he was president.
*  And I think he's being treated unfairly.
*  So we're here to support him, let him know there's a whole lot of people that love him.
*  We're standing behind him and praying for him.
*  Have you read the indictment?
*  No, I've heard about them.
*  Did you see the picture of the boxes in the bathroom with the classified material?
*  I saw those and I saw the ones that were in Biden's garage behind his car.
*  I saw those too.
*  And you hear about all those things.
*  So all of this is being blown way out of proportion.
*  They're just looking for anything and everything.
*  How come a lot of people aren't talking about all those boxes that Biden had in his garage?
*  I know Fox does sometimes, but that's about it.
*  Well, there's a special counsel investigating that as well, a different one.
*  So we don't know what's going to happen.
*  Funny how that doesn't go anywhere, isn't it?
*  And how about those 30,000 emails that, what's her name, Hillary had?
*  But you see, here's the point.
*  If they don't want to indict her and they don't want to really investigate Biden,
*  then get off his back.
*  But see, they don't want to.
*  They're scared of this man.
*  And you would think, this guy sounds just like a guy that watches Fox all the time.
*  No, I've got a brain and I can see what's going on.
*  It's a barrage of these attacks on him, but you don't see that on these other people.
*  What the Justice Department would say, I think, is that in some of those cases,
*  there wasn't the intent to obstruct afterwards, but that Trump jerked them around for a year and a half.
*  Yeah, they say that.
*  They say that.
*  What do they say about Hillary erasing 30,000 emails?
*  Oh, well, you know, it doesn't really matter.
*  Jim Coney said it was very irresponsible, but that no one would prosecute.
*  Yeah, irresponsible.
*  That's a tough word, isn't it?
*  Well, let me ask you this.
*  Why didn't Trump, who under the Justice Department, last four years, prosecute Hillary then?
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe they just don't.
*  I don't know.
*  I have no idea.
*  But there's proof they should at least look into it.
*  Here, let's indict the guy.
*  Oh, and by the way, let's set his trial date during the primaries next spring.
*  Let's not do it now.
*  Let's wait till the primaries next spring.
*  You know?
*  Why do we not see the injustice in all of that?
*  So you think they're looking for anything on Trump that they can get?
*  If he walked across this row and the light was red, they'd give him for J-Rock.
*  So the allegation that they have Trump on tape saying that he has...
*  Have you heard that tape?
*  No, I don't think anyone besides them has heard it.
*  I understand.
*  And I'm not being facetious.
*  I haven't heard it either.
*  No, we just read the transcript in the indictment.
*  So you're saying until we hear it, we can't know?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  I know this.
*  They were swearing up and down.
*  Adam Schiff, swearing up and down.
*  Oh yeah, all this Russian collusion.
*  Oh man, I'm swearing up and down.
*  This is true.
*  It wasn't.
*  They've been swearing stuff about Trump for a long, long time.
*  You're saying this is kind of a familiar story with Trump.
*  To me, it's just one more attack.
*  Then you've got the thing in New York going on.
*  Seriously, the littlest things, and now they're making big things.
*  I sure didn't make big things out of what Hillary did.
*  So, I would just always think he was just treated unjustly.
*  And I'm not being a homie.
*  A Trump guy.
*  Y'all can write me down as a homie if you want to.
*  Sir, thanks so much for chatting with us.
*  Yeah, thank you.
*  Any other thing you'd like to say?
*  No, I'm good.
*  Can I ask how we're doing?
*  Yeah, so Donald Trump is supposedly inside the building we hear.
*  He's gone out.
*  He's Trump arrived, somehow discreetly, underground somewhere, and went into the courthouse.
*  Yes.
*  I wonder how long it'll take for the judge to see him and for the arraignment to take place.
*  Glenn, once Donald Trump enters the courthouse, we can't really see anything.
*  But you can, because you were in that building.
*  So walk us through what happened and what you were able to see.
*  Well, sometime around 2 o'clock, maybe a little later, we spotted a motorcade of four SUVs
*  entering sort of an underground garage area at the courthouse.
*  From that point in time, we are told he was taken to a holding area with the U.S. Marshal Service
*  where he was electronically fingerprinted.
*  This is not an ink deal.
*  This is him sort of rolling his hand over an electronic scanner.
*  He was not given a mugshot.
*  The Marshal Service sort of joked, we have plenty of images of Donald Trump on file.
*  Around 2.35 p.m., reporters, including myself, were led into the courtroom.
*  We had expected to sort of sit there and have Trump brought in, but we walked in and Trump
*  sat at the defendant's table, flanked by both of his lawyers, and Walt Nauta, his co-defendant,
*  sat a few feet to his right.
*  And just to remind people, his co-defendant is someone accused of essentially conspiring
*  with him to obstruct the federal government's efforts to find and retrieve these classified documents.
*  Exactly.
*  His co-defendant is a former White House aide.
*  You would call him his body man.
*  He sort of does everything for the president.
*  And he is accused of helping Trump move around a bunch of boxes before the FBI, before the
*  Justice Department, and even before Trump's own lawyers got a chance to look at that paperwork.
*  And they are there together in the courtroom?
*  Together, yes.
*  And lo and behold, about 20 feet away from Trump, on the other side of the courtroom,
*  sat Jack Smith, the special counsel.
*  Interesting.
*  So Trump is kind of talking with his lawyers.
*  There's even a couple of jokes exchanged.
*  But then the atmosphere changes abruptly at 2.45 p.m.
*  A court worker shouts out, the camera in this courtroom has been activated so that all the
*  press who are downstairs on the fifth floor can see everything.
*  Trump immediately stopped talking to his lawyer and stared into the camera for a good minute.
*  And his expression, which had been tense but relatively relaxed, stiffened up.
*  And that is the demeanor that he maintained for the rest of the hearing.
*  And what's the expression on Trump's face?
*  I didn't see his face, but I saw his back.
*  Trump had his arms crossed, and he was so tense you could see sort of the muscles pushing
*  through the back of his blue suit jacket.
*  He was not a comfortable guy.
*  And then the judge enters the courtroom, and it's not the one most people would have expected to see.
*  That's Aileen Cannon, who is a Trump appointee who had previously issued some very pro-Trump rulings.
*  It was this little-known magistrate judge, Jonathan Goodman, who just by luck of the draw,
*  happened to be assigned the preliminary hearing in the case.
*  And he seems to be the only one, either on the prosecution side or defense side, who is relatively relaxed.
*  He greets everyone, he's talking to the president in deferential terms, he reads Trump his rights,
*  and then he asks Trump if he wants to enter a plea.
*  And then Todd Blanche, one of Trump's lawyers, stands up and says, emphatically,
*  we most certainly enter a plea of not guilty.
*  What else does this judge say to Trump?
*  The only real sticking point in this hearing was this question of whether or not Trump can still communicate
*  with Walt Nauta, who still works for him, and is on his payroll,
*  and other potential witnesses in his security detail and his political operation on his personal staff.
*  And it really gets to the core of the entire case, that the people around Trump are also perhaps
*  the most important witnesses in this case, and a lot of them are still around him.
*  So how do you negotiate that?
*  How do you allow somebody to remain on your security detail or continue to work on your political campaign
*  when they could be a potential witness?
*  In other words, if I'm cutting right to the core of this, Glenn, and correct me if I'm wrong,
*  there's a fear that Trump is going to pressure his body man, who is now his co-conspirator,
*  into giving testimony that would be favorable to Trump,
*  something that would be made significantly easier by the fact that Trump works with this guy day in, day out.
*  Yeah, it's just a tangled mess.
*  Whether or not Trump gets to be in communication with these folks,
*  what the nature of the communications, what restrictions on those communications are going to be,
*  there was about 15 minutes of sparring on that, and there was a resolution of sorts,
*  which was basically, Walt Nauta can't talk to Trump about the case,
*  he could talk to Trump about everything else, but how do you really enforce that?
*  Okay, so how does this arraignment ultimately come to an end?
*  Well, that's what's most fascinating.
*  Jack Smith is sitting 20 feet away from Donald Trump, and they both have to exit the courtroom.
*  Trump leaves first through a side door on my right,
*  and then a minute later, almost choreographed,
*  Smith gets up, walks through the gate, and exits on precisely the opposite side of the courtroom.
*  It was probably just the way that things played out,
*  but it really looked like both of them didn't really want to have to bump into each other.
*  And then when it was all over, we took a deep breath and realized
*  we'd just witnessed something that had never happened before.
*  A former president of the United States being brought into a courtroom
*  and charged by the federal government.
*  Well, Glenn, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Hello?
*  Hey, Maggie?
*  Hi, Michael.
*  Hi, hi, hi, hi. Can you hear me?
*  I can hear you.
*  Okay, so this is what cell phone quality sounds like.
*  Okay.
*  So I just want to explain, Maggie, why we're reaching you on your cell phone
*  and not one of these, you know, highfalutin, high-tech, higher quality sounding devices that we usually use.
*  Mm-hmm. I am sitting underneath a table out on the patio at Bedminster
*  where reporters are actually sitting out here for the next five hours or so
*  waiting for Trent to come speak after his arraignment.
*  We have no sun cover and there is no Wi-Fi that they are making available to us,
*  so this is how you and I are speaking.
*  Got it.
*  So as I said, I am speaking to you from under a table
*  where someone just kicked me in the back and, you know, there was stuff on the table.
*  I mean, the things you do for us, Maggie.
*  I am a devoted member of the New York Times team.
*  There you go.
*  Okay, so to the matter at hand, Maggie, now that Trump has been arraigned
*  and has entered a plea of not guilty in this federal indictment,
*  we are turning to you from Bedminster, from under this table,
*  to understand what his defense is going to look like,
*  his legal defense for the courtroom and his defense in the court of public opinion.
*  So let's start, Maggie, with what you have come to understand
*  his legal defense might look like.
*  Sure.
*  So, Michael, the legal strategy is by far the biggest challenge for Trump in this case
*  because of the severity of the charges, the potential for jail time,
*  and because the indictment contains so much evidence
*  that the government says, lay out Trump's criminal behavior
*  when it comes to these classified documents
*  and to obstruction of their investigation.
*  So at a 30,000 foot level, Michael, their plan is to try to slow this process down
*  and to toss sand in the gears of the legal process.
*  And what does sand in the gears look like in the case of a federal indictment of this scale?
*  Well, the emerging sense is it's going to look like a couple of different things,
*  and they haven't said specifically what it will be.
*  But we anticipate, just based on their public comments,
*  that Trump's lawyers are going to use the legal system to argue
*  that the prosecutors in the special counsel Jack Smith's office,
*  who brought this indictment against Trump, did something wrong.
*  But they committed prosecutorial misconduct along the way.
*  Okay. And what might prosecutorial misconduct be
*  when it comes to the special counsel's office?
*  I mean, just help us understand what that might look like.
*  Sure. So one thing that we know is that there have been sealed motions filed
*  or a sealed motion filed to try to obtain transcripts from the grand jury proceedings.
*  The idea is basically that Trump's lawyers would pour over these transcripts
*  looking for things that they could object to that could show bias
*  or misconduct or inappropriate behavior with the grand jury.
*  And we know one thing that they might be looking for
*  is to suggest the prosecutors did not behave appropriately
*  when they were dealing with interviews with a couple of Trump's lawyers.
*  And Trump's legal team might be suggesting that
*  because we now know from the indictment
*  that some of Trump's lawyers, and this is quite unusual,
*  were compelled to provide testimony against Trump by the special counsel
*  and that some of that testimony was very powerful
*  in convincing prosecutors to bring these charges against Trump.
*  So yes, a couple of them testified, but one in particular
*  was a very significant witness, and that was Evan Corcoran.
*  Now Corcoran had copious notes, including at least two
*  that he took on audio files and then there were transcripts of them.
*  And those served as something of a roadmap for prosecutors
*  who were investigating this.
*  Now Corcoran was compelled to testify by a judge.
*  It was not Corcoran's choice.
*  Turning over those notes was compelled by a judge,
*  but that has proven to be a truly significant turning point in this case.
*  And they're going to try, in particular, I believe,
*  to say that the notes from this lawyer, Evan Corcoran,
*  should not be admitted into trial testimony and evidence.
*  Got it.
*  And do we know what specific argument they're likely to use
*  as to why this lawyer's notes and anything else he said
*  shouldn't be used in this trial?
*  They're going to, I suspect, make the same argument
*  that they made before the judge who ordered them turned over
*  in the first place, which is that there is no legitimate reason
*  to have pierced the attorney-client privilege
*  and that this was a bridge too far.
*  Now, a lot of this is going to depend on how well-reasoned
*  that judge's decision in saying that they had to be turned over
*  in the first place, but we will find out.
*  Right. And we've talked about this with some of our colleagues,
*  Mike Schmidt, Ben Protest.
*  The reason why the government was able to pierce the attorney-client privilege
*  was because they believe there's evidence that Trump, the client,
*  committed a crime, and therefore, the lawyer's
*  traditional privileged conversation with the client
*  loses that privilege. That's the thinking.
*  So they would need a very strong argument that that's not true.
*  Yes, that's correct.
*  Maggie, do we know there to be any other pieces of evidence
*  that the Trump legal team is targeting and seeking to
*  basically knock out of this case, get tossed out?
*  That's what we know of right now.
*  There's not a ton of other evidence we know of that they're going to point to
*  as inadmissible. We do know they're trying to argue
*  that there is political bias in the background of at least one of the prosecutors involved.
*  Hmm. In other words, a conflict of interest
*  that might make the prosecutor ineligible
*  or wrong for the case. They might try to take that up.
*  Is that going to possibly result in the entire indictment
*  in some way being tossed out?
*  Well, that's what they're going to try. It's a high bar
*  to get the indictment tossed out, but I suspect you will see
*  all kinds of efforts along those lines.
*  Well, to that point, let's assume at some point this does go to a trial, right?
*  And that these efforts to slow the process, get things thrown out, only go so far.
*  Then Trump needs a legal argument for why
*  what he did was not a crime.
*  What do we think that legal argument might be?
*  Well, I think, Michael, we do have a feel for so far because of things he's said
*  and his lawyers have said. He's argued, and I think
*  he and they will keep arguing, that he was allowed to take these documents
*  from the White House under something called the Presidential Records Act
*  which governs the ownership of presidential records.
*  And what does that act actually say?
*  So that act, here's what it says, here's what Trump says it says.
*  In Trump's telling, under this law, Trump has a few years
*  to go through all these papers to figure out what he can keep
*  until the records are returned to the National Archives.
*  The law does not say that. It says that all records must be returned
*  before a president leaves office.
*  So he's arguing there's some window of time that he still says he's in
*  in which he can rifle through papers and decide what's his
*  and what's the government's and the law you're saying doesn't really say that
*  but that's his interpretation of it?
*  Yes, that's what he's saying his interpretation is, Michael
*  and I think that's going to be a pretty hard thing for him to argue in court.
*  His defense so far, Michael, is basically
*  court of public opinion as opposed to things that will stand up
*  in a court case. Now we will see what happens when he has a legal
*  team assembled but right now these are not strong
*  arguments against these charges.
*  So, Maggie, you have nicely teed up Trump's approach to defending himself
*  in the court of public opinion rather than just the court room.
*  And we started to get a look at that over the past few days
*  but you have been talking to those around Trump
*  about what exactly is at the heart of his public
*  relations strategy. So walk us through that.
*  Sure, so much of this feels familiar, Michael
*  and it's gone back several years now. You play the victim, you blame
*  the deep state or you blame Democrats, punish Republicans
*  who stray for disloyalty but the fact that this is
*  the second indictment of Trump and that it's a federal indictment
*  from Joe Biden's Department of Justice changes the dynamic.
*  And how does it change that familiar dynamic
*  that you described?
*  Okay, explain how that's going to work and explain how that's going to help him
*  with his legal woes.
*  Got it. So the way Trump and his allies see this indictment is as allowing them to more naturally, more easily, more convincingly
*  portray the Republican primary is kind of like not a big deal, not really even a thing
*  because ultimately it's Trump versus Biden and Biden has made it so by allowing his
*  justice department to indict Trump.
*  That's exactly right and I anticipate that it will swing back toward attacking other Republicans months down the road
*  but for now it really is about a head to head with Biden and Trump.
*  Maggie, I'm curious what Trump's opponents may be thinking about
*  when they hear about the impeachment of Trump.
*  I mean, I think that's a very interesting question.
*  I think that's a very interesting question.
*  I think that's a very interesting question.
*  What do you think Trump's opponents make of the way he's seeing this moment as one where he now zooms ahead
*  and sort of doesn't really need to participate in a primary?
*  Well, they're not enjoying it obviously.
*  People who are running for president or Republican primary don't want to be seen as also rams under any circumstance
*  and they certainly don't want to be told the race is over just as it's really beginning.
*  And they are stymied as to how to handle it, Michael.
*  You've seen nondescentists tread kind of cautiously toward suggesting Trump maybe did something wrong
*  but also suggesting that there is selective prosecution.
*  You have really only seen a very slight shift from Tim Scott and Nikki Haley
*  toward suggesting that Donald Trump did something that was inappropriate
*  or that at least that the charges are serious.
*  You've seen Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson continue to attack Trump over the charges
*  but as long as they are the only two really doing that aggressively, not much changes.
*  Maggie, it's really interesting. We actually saw another version of this, Trump narrating
*  kind of setting the terms of all this play out actually in front of the courthouse
*  where he pleaded not guilty when another one of his rivals, Vivek Ramaswamy,
*  held a news conference and he said that if he wins the nomination, he's going to pardon Donald Trump.
*  That's going to be one of the first things he does.
*  And he challenged the entire rest of the Republican primary field to make the same commitment,
*  to promise to pardon Trump. I have two questions for you.
*  One, do you think that pardoning Trump may end up being a litmus test throughout this Republican primary?
*  And two, do you think that these folks would actually follow through and carry that out if they win?
*  I definitely think there's going to be pressure on candidates to say, Michael,
*  whether they will pardon Trump.
*  And I think that could get very uncomfortable, particularly on a debate stage, if everybody is together.
*  He definitely understands that other Republicans who want to become president need his support
*  and need him to not try to undermine them should they beat him.
*  And that provides him some level of comfort that it might be in somebody's interest
*  who's a Republican who becomes president to pardon.
*  I think I want to translate that because it's fascinating the idea you're raising.
*  Trump might lose the Republican primary and yet the winner of the primary,
*  let's say it's Ron DeSantis, let's say it's Chris Christie,
*  they would go to Donald Trump and say, please endorse me.
*  And I think we have to imagine, both of us knowing Donald Trump,
*  that he would say something like, sure, I will endorse you if you promise to pardon me.
*  I could see him not just intonating that, but saying it.
*  And I think that any Republican candidate who either had won the nomination or was close to it
*  would feel compelled to at least seem to Trump that they were humoring this idea.
*  Whether they would follow through is anybody's guess.
*  But I think that candidates have a habit of saying something to win a primary
*  that they may not necessarily do once it happens.
*  Well, Maggie, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Michael, thanks for having me.
*  I'm going to climb out from under the table. I will talk to you back there.
*  Thank you. Bye.
*  Bye, Maggie.
*  Today we witness the most evil and heinous abuse of power in the history of our country.
*  On Tuesday night, in a speech from Bedminster, Trump called his arraignment
*  a day that would live in infamy, and assailed President Biden for, in Trump's telling, allowing it to happen.
*  Very sad thing to watch. A corrupt sitting president had his top political opponent
*  arrested on fake and fabricated charges of which he and numerous other presidents would be guilty.
*  Right in the middle of a presidential election in which he's losing very badly.
*  But Trump told the crowd that the charges against him would only make him stronger as a candidate for president.
*  But they will fail and we will win bigger and better than ever before.
*  Meanwhile, the calls from Trump's Republican rivals to pardon him only grew.
*  After Trump's arraignment, another candidate in the Republican race,
*  former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, said that if elected, she too favored pardoning the former president.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, the federal government offered the latest evidence that its long-term plan to lower inflation is working.
*  Consumer prices rose 4% in May, down sharply from a peak monthly increase of about 9% last summer.
*  Inflation remains high by historical standards, but it now appears that the Federal Reserve's policy
*  of repeatedly raising interest rates to push down price increases is achieving its goal.
*  And, The Times reports that 22 members of the U.S. Army's secretive Delta Force Commando Unit
*  were injured over the weekend during a helicopter accident in northeast Syria.
*  The military has refused to say what mission the commandos were on when the accident occurred.
*  But Delta Force has previously carried out raids in that part of Syria against the Islamic State.
*  Today's episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson, Asli Chaturvedi, Diana Wynn, Mary Wilson and Luke Vanderplug.
*  It was edited by Rachel Quester and Lisa Chow, contains original music by Mary Lozano and Dan Pell,
*  and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lienfork of Wenderley.
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Bobarro. See you tomorrow.
*  you
