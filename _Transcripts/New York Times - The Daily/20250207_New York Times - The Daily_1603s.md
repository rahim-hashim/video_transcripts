# Where Are the Democrats? | 'The Daily' Round Table With New York Times Journalists
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=5.22s)]
*  So, friends, welcome to the roundtable. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=6.86s)]
*  Reed and Annie, thank you for making the trek from the Times Bureau all the way to our studio [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=11.06s)]
*  there in DC. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=15.94s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=16.94s)]
*  Hi, Michael. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=17.94s)]
*  Can I quote the Linda from Wicked? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=18.94s)]
*  It's good to see me, isn't it? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=21.14s)]
*  Yes, you can. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=24.3s)]
*  That was great. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=26.86s)]
*  And Shane. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=29.5s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=30.5s)]
*  Sorry, Reed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=31.5s)]
*  I was also going to say hi to Shane. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=32.5s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=33.5s)]
*  Well, Shane, thank you for being here with me in the New York studio. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=34.5s)]
*  All three of you have been very closely covering the story of the Democratic Party in this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=38.3s)]
*  moment. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=43.22s)]
*  And you know this well. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=44.22s)]
*  Whenever a party loses a presidential election, we speak of it wandering through the wilderness. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=45.46s)]
*  When a party loses a presidential race and both chambers of Congress, we speak of that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=51.2s)]
*  party as being in an especially dark wilderness. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=56.34s)]
*  And when you lose the presidency and both chambers of Congress and the new president [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=59.32s)]
*  of the opposing party takes 300 executive actions that undo everything your party has [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=63.16s)]
*  ever stood for, I don't really know that there is a phrase for it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=68.12s)]
*  Do you have one in mind? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=70.88s)]
*  Deep in the wilderness. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=72.12s)]
*  Existential crisis? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=75.28s)]
*  You know, I had somebody before the election tell me that if Trump won, that Democrats [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=76.28s)]
*  would be way more effed than they were last time to sanitize that phrase a little bit. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=82.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=87.16s)]
*  And when I checked in with her last week, she said that it was worse than she anticipated, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=88.24s)]
*  even more bad than they thought. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=94.36s)]
*  Even more effed than the previous effed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=98.64s)]
*  So I want to start by talking about the kind of soul searching that the Democratic Party [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=99.64s)]
*  is doing and whether that soul searching has started to arrive at any kind of consensus [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  about what exactly the party's problems are and how systemic and deep those problems are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=111.72s)]
*  From a distance, it doesn't look like there's a consensus. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=120.08s)]
*  So let's talk about that, Shane. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=122.76s)]
*  I want to start with you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=123.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=124.76s)]
*  I mean, I think the question of how deep in the wilderness is the Democratic Party is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=125.76s)]
*  when I asked a whole bunch of Democrats in the last couple of weeks. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=129.28s)]
*  You literally burned up the phone lines of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=133.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=135.36s)]
*  I called it basically as many people as I could to say just how deep is this hole? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=136.36s)]
*  And actually the answer was really surprising to me, which is that there is not at all an [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=140.6s)]
*  agreement on the size of the hole that the Democratic Party finds itself in. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=144.56s)]
*  And the reason is that, yes, they've lost the White House and the House and the Senate, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=148.72s)]
*  and they're watching all these things erode faster than imaginable. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=153.32s)]
*  But they also have watched wipeout elections in their lifetime. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=157.98s)]
*  In the 1980s when the Democratic Party won a single state in a presidential election, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=160.84s)]
*  that this doesn't look like that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  This is not in fact a wipeout of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=167.12s)]
*  And so if you don't think the party is in as deep of a hole, you're not looking to make [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=170.12s)]
*  that kind of big systemic change. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=174.68s)]
*  And I think that disagreement on just how screwed the party is, is central to understand [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  what they're going to do to get out of the hole. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=182.8s)]
*  If you think that they're pretty close, then you're not going to make big changes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  You're going to wait for Trump to overreach and you're going to hope to pick up a few [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=187.76s)]
*  seats and you get a foothold in the House of Representatives in 2026. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=190.68s)]
*  Andy, it sounds like Shane's describing a split between those who think, look, the math, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=193.52s)]
*  look at the House. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  That's tactical. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=199.84s)]
*  Our message couldn't have been that bad if we almost retained control of the House of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=201.16s)]
*  Representatives. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=207.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=208.3s)]
*  I've heard that argument a lot from DNC people, especially after the election, were kind of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=209.3s)]
*  saying, look, we actually outperformed in a lot of these districts. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=214.24s)]
*  We did really well this cycle. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=218.36s)]
*  And that was like a hard argument to take seriously. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=220.6s)]
*  Like they lost the House and they're saying like, no, we actually want. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=224.2s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi was a proponent of that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=227.16s)]
*  They did outperform in a lot of districts where they should have done worse than they [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=229.2s)]
*  did. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  They outperformed the top of the ticket. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  And if they can't win back the House in two years, then I would say there's no coming [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  back for this party ever. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=243.32s)]
*  I think there's a difference between the people who look at this and say they only need to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  win two or three seats to win back the majority and the people who look at what has happened [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=251.76s)]
*  in Washington and the country over the last two weeks and change. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=257.46s)]
*  Trump does not have a mathematical advantage in the government that's requisite to the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=261.9s)]
*  types of actions that he's taken place since he's been president. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=268.58s)]
*  And that's, I think, where some of this bifurcation has taken place. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=271.9s)]
*  And because a lot of the Democrats came into this new Trump administration, I think with [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=276.78s)]
*  an unrealistic anticipation of what he would do once he became the president. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=283.66s)]
*  And they were clearly ill prepared politically, certainly for the types of actions that Trump [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=288.26000000000005s)]
*  has taken. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=295.18s)]
*  Reed, I want to put something to you since both Shane and Annie have been giving voice [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=296.18s)]
*  to the let's not freak out Democratic point of view in this moment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=299.18s)]
*  I want you to contemplate the case for a freak out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  OK, this was something written by one of the three of you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=308.62s)]
*  And here's what it says. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=311.94s)]
*  Democrats who share the bleak outlook for their future see statistical signs of the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=313.82s)]
*  party's decline everywhere. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=319.34s)]
*  Blue states are a seeding population to red states. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=320.86s)]
*  Voter registration figures are mostly headed in the wrong direction for the Democrats. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=323.5s)]
*  More Americans are identifying with the GOP than with Democrats. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=327.7s)]
*  And Democrats lost ground in this last election among core constituencies, including lower [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=330.82s)]
*  income, Latino and younger voters, as President Trump swept every battleground state. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=335.54s)]
*  That's the case for freaking out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=342.1s)]
*  And Shane, that was your sentence, your paragraph. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  It seems like a pretty strong case for freaking out if you're the Democratic Party. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=347.34000000000003s)]
*  And the people who are making the case for freaking out, frankly, have been doing more [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=352.26s)]
*  freaking out over the last couple of weeks. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  They were freaking out from the morning after the election. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=358.02s)]
*  And their case is not without merit, frankly. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=361.94s)]
*  We saw what happened in the election. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=366.22s)]
*  We saw all of these demographics moving away from the party. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=368.1s)]
*  What none of the people who have been moved toward what we would call an autopsy or a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=372.82000000000005s)]
*  post-election review have wanted to discuss has been the origin of why all those things [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=378.94s)]
*  went the wrong way. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=387.70000000000005s)]
*  And none of them want to talk about the idea of the fact that, or the reality, that they [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=389.5s)]
*  all got behind a very unpopular president and basically told the American people that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=394.96s)]
*  he wasn't too old, that he wasn't too frail, and on and on and on, and backed him until [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=399.2s)]
*  they didn't, by which point lots of these voters didn't believe them when they said [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=405.64s)]
*  anything else because of what they had said about Biden. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=412.0s)]
*  I mean, let's talk about that point you're raising, the origins of the Democrats' problems. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=414.48s)]
*  If you're inclined to think that this is an existential crisis moment for the party, it [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=419.32s)]
*  makes sense to ask the question, what exactly went wrong? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=423.84s)]
*  Reed, you're pointing to the observation that Biden's weaknesses as a candidate and party [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=426.96s)]
*  leaders' decision to not ask him to step aside earlier might be a factor. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  But when we ask the question of what went wrong, it seems like that might be a very [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=437.56s)]
*  narrow reading of things. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=442.0s)]
*  And Shane, I want to ask you about something that Congressman Pat Ryan from upstate New [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=443.96s)]
*  York says about the Democratic Party. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=448.4s)]
*  He's not talking about whether Joe Biden stayed in the race too long and Democrats, you know, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=450.4s)]
*  weren't eyes wide open about his health and his various problems. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  He says that the Democratic brand overall is so weak at this point that the only way [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=457.91999999999996s)]
*  Democrats like him can win is by running against the Democratic brand, which of course is not [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=464.12s)]
*  a great strategy if you're a Democrat. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=471.62s)]
*  So I want to broaden the conversation to what someone like a congressman, Pat Ryan, says [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  are deeper problems with the party's identity, ideology and its relationship to the voters. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=477.16s)]
*  I mean, I think Pat Ryan's putting his finger on this fundamental problem that's facing [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=482.36s)]
*  the party that's beyond Joe Biden. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=486.92s)]
*  It's a structural problem about the Democratic brand, which is if you look at the House of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=489.0s)]
*  Representatives, more Democrats need to win Trumpy districts to get a majority. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  And the same is true for the Senate. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=498.04s)]
*  And so you need the brand to be such that you can win the majority by not having to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  run against the brand. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=503.58000000000004s)]
*  With basically no one, there are arguably two House Republicans who run against the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=506.24s)]
*  national Republican brand and they still have a majority, right? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=510.12s)]
*  There are a dozen Democrats who try to distance themselves from the national brand in the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=513.84s)]
*  way that Pat Ryan is describing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=518.08s)]
*  The optimist case for Democrats around, okay, the hole's not that deep. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=520.52s)]
*  The concern really is that that means the party's missing an opportunity for introspection. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=524.92s)]
*  Somebody else said to me, one of the only advantages of losing is getting to think about [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=530.14s)]
*  how you reset and rebuild. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=534.3s)]
*  And if you're not going to actually do that rethinking about what the party stands for, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=536.64s)]
*  then you're unlikely to end up succeeding over the long haul. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=540.74s)]
*  I think the bigger issue is that it's a vibes problem and what people think of Democrats. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=543.4599999999999s)]
*  And that really goes back farther than Biden. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=547.9799999999999s)]
*  It goes back to Obama when the party was seen as like college professors drinking wine, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=550.3s)]
*  being in urban enclaves, where the Democratic Party of FDR and Truman and Kennedy was much [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=557.18s)]
*  more of a working class party. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=565.5799999999999s)]
*  Another person making that same argument is Congresswoman Marie Gluz in Camp Perez from [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=567.64s)]
*  Washington State. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=571.5799999999999s)]
*  She owns an auto shop with her husband. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=572.5799999999999s)]
*  She's been making the case that the Democratic Party does not respect the working class and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=574.5799999999999s)]
*  that they need more working class people in Congress, that all these progressive policies [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=579.5s)]
*  like student loan forgiveness, she voted against it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=583.86s)]
*  Why? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=588.14s)]
*  Because no one in her district went to college. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=589.14s)]
*  And so she's saying that like to Reid's point, some of this is for urban educated people [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=591.78s)]
*  and is leaving out large swaths of the country that Democrats aren't speaking to. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=597.9s)]
*  That's what people like Perez are making. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=602.34s)]
*  And there are so many affinity groups, sort of to use a phrase in vogue in some of these [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=603.78s)]
*  circles, in the Democratic coalition at this point. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=609.94s)]
*  They had a discussion at the Democratic National Committee meeting over the weekend about whether [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=612.54s)]
*  to maintain a gender balance among their vice chair positions, because some people might [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=617.58s)]
*  not consider themselves men or women. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=622.54s)]
*  And so like those types of discussions sort of percolate out into the broader culture [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=625.62s)]
*  of what it means to be a Democrat. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=630.46s)]
*  Nobody was actually watching the Democratic Party's meeting over the weekend. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=633.1s)]
*  You were. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=636.78s)]
*  Nobody who was not being paid to do so, I think, was watching it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=638.64s)]
*  But for people who are not engaged in one of those groups, they can get turned off by [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  that even if Democrats think their issues and agenda are in the interest of these very [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=647.9399999999999s)]
*  people who are turned off by the way they present themselves. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=653.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=655.5s)]
*  And Shane, I want to bring that up with you, because I think one of the questions that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=656.5s)]
*  a proper soul searching exercise might lead to among Democrats is the idea that the Democratic [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=658.14s)]
*  Party, and I want your feedback on this based on your reporting, has allowed its coalition, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=665.1s)]
*  the many fragments of it, activists especially, to push the entire party and its brand toward [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=670.12s)]
*  a less recognizable place than the Democratic Party of 15 or 20 years ago. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=677.48s)]
*  A party that, for example, talks about diversity and DEI as hugely important to the identity [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=682.48s)]
*  of the party in the country, endorses things like medical interventions for trans youth. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=689.54s)]
*  I'm generalizing here, but a party that talks about those things in that way, is it overly [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=696.08s)]
*  beholden not to a broad cross section of the electorate, but to the loudest voices in its [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=702.48s)]
*  coalition? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  I think that's a big part of the conversation inside the party. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a question of what do you emphasize? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=713.64s)]
*  What do you put forward? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=716.0400000000001s)]
*  If you are letting the party be defined in the views of an average voter as focused on [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=717.08s)]
*  It makes it harder to make an economic case to those same voters. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=723.24s)]
*  The New York Times and Ipsos just did a poll. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=727.16s)]
*  How do people view the Democratic Party? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=729.76s)]
*  How do people view the Republican Party? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=731.4s)]
*  The top two issues that people associated with the Democratic Party were abortion and [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=733.2s)]
*  LGBT rights. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=738.92s)]
*  Those are not in the top issues for what voters cared about overall. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=743.08s)]
*  The top issues for Republicans were around the economy and immigration, which were among [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=745.5600000000001s)]
*  the top issues for voters. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=750.72s)]
*  Democrats are going to be supportive of diversity programs in general. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=753.56s)]
*  The question is how much you emphasize that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=758.8s)]
*  Is that the message that voters are hearing for what the party's priorities are versus [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=760.88s)]
*  it happens to be part of the party platform? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=766.64s)]
*  When you look at the issues that professional Democrats in Washington think of as their [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=769.0s)]
*  core issues, they're all very popular. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=775.24s)]
*  Raising the minimum wage is popular. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=780.2s)]
*  Most of the economic agenda that they talk about, even if people aren't hearing them, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  is pretty popular. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=788.08s)]
*  The problem comes in that the actual Democrats who run for office themselves are less popular [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=789.36s)]
*  because they have to accede to all these various things that different groups want. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=795.0s)]
*  But when any of these issues have been put on the ballot as standalone referenda, they [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=799.32s)]
*  almost always pass. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=803.9200000000001s)]
*  What you're pointing to read is what I think explains why the party can't quite make up [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=805.68s)]
*  its mind as it does this soul searching and thinking about the nature of its problems, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=810.3599999999999s)]
*  about whether this is a moment for revolution or caution, because it looks at what happened [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=815.3199999999999s)]
*  in those congressional races and says, we didn't do horribly. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=820.4399999999999s)]
*  And it looks at these issues sometimes in isolation and says, they stand up okay on [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  their own. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=827.8399999999999s)]
*  So maybe we're not a party in crisis. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=828.8399999999999s)]
*  It feels like the party is having a split personality on the question of whether to [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=830.88s)]
*  be a party of protest in this moment or a party of waiting and seeing what the country's [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=838.0s)]
*  reaction to Trump will be. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=844.56s)]
*  So I want to first play a clip from Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader in the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=848.8s)]
*  House, who is taking the don't overreact approach. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=855.92s)]
*  Let me just play that for you guys. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=860.76s)]
*  We understand that extreme Republicans have a strategy. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=862.48s)]
*  They want to flood the zone with outrage, but we can't chase every outrage. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=865.8s)]
*  I'm a Yankee fan and Aaron Judge is my favorite player. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=873.56s)]
*  One of the reasons that he's a great hitter is that he does not swing at every pitch. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=877.84s)]
*  We're not going to swing at every pitch. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=882.84s)]
*  We're going to swing at the ones that matter for the American people. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=884.4s)]
*  Then there's a contrasting view articulated by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  who says, right now you have to swing at every pitch. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=896.6s)]
*  He said Trump floods the zone every hour of every day. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=900.64s)]
*  We have to do the same thing. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=903.98s)]
*  So those seem like the two contrasting arguments on tactics. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  I want you all to help me understand the basis for both of those and also which one seems [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=913.36s)]
*  to be prevailing in the first two weeks or so of the Trump presidency. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=919.04s)]
*  I'm just excited to talk about baseball with Reid on the podcast. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=922.4s)]
*  I think it breaks down to the question of is less more or is more more? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=926.88s)]
*  That is one that is really gripping Democrats, especially having watched Trump flood the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=933.48s)]
*  zone in 2024 in the media. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=938.2s)]
*  He was an omnipresence in the campaign trail in a way that in which a more cautious Kamala [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=942.16s)]
*  Harris picked her spots and often performed in those spots. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=946.8s)]
*  It wasn't quite enough. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=951.64s)]
*  There are a lot of Democrats saying, get out there and respond to everything. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=952.64s)]
*  That is the Chris Murphy school of thought saying, it's not that all these fights are [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=956.88s)]
*  winners. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=960.92s)]
*  In fact, some of them might not be winners, but the act of opposing is powerful. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=961.92s)]
*  Those two sides are just pulling at each other each day. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=966.6s)]
*  Trump is making so much news every day that Democrats have a new opportunity to either [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=970.28s)]
*  respond or not. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=974.64s)]
*  You're watching that debate play out in Congress, which you cover really closely and where it [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=976.36s)]
*  would seem Democrats have one of their major levers of power, which is the bully pulpit [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=980.4s)]
*  of Congress, opposing cabinet nominees from the president if they want to, or deciding [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=986.84s)]
*  that the right move in this moment is to work with Trump on issues like immigration. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=992.68s)]
*  So what are you saying? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=997.92s)]
*  I'm seeing a huge shift in real time. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=998.92s)]
*  So I think when Trump was elected, Democrats really wanted to show part of our brand is [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1001.76s)]
*  that we honor free and fair elections. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1008.04s)]
*  He won. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1010.64s)]
*  He won the popular vote. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1011.64s)]
*  We're not going to just be opposed to be opposed. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1012.64s)]
*  We're going to go to his inauguration. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1015.04s)]
*  We're going to consider his nominees on his or her merits. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1016.56s)]
*  That started to shift with some of the actions the Trump administration was taking. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1020.4s)]
*  The federal funding freeze was the most obvious place where Democrats could stage on the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1025.68s)]
*  merits a huge protest. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1029.6000000000001s)]
*  Also cutting off USAID, letting Elon Musk plug in his personal hard drive to the entire [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1032.28s)]
*  Treasury database. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1039.24s)]
*  Metaphorically speaking. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1041.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1042.24s)]
*  So these are actions that now they feel differently. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1043.24s)]
*  It's moving. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1045.76s)]
*  And it's moving under pressure from outside of Congress. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1047.48s)]
*  Reid wrote a really good story about Democratic governors calling Schumer and saying, oppose [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1049.8400000000001s)]
*  all of them and him saying, no, it's better to pick our spots. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
*  That has already shifted. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1059.76s)]
*  As of yesterday, Chuck Schumer now told his caucus, I'm voting against everyone now and [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1060.76s)]
*  I urge you to do the same. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1065.6799999999998s)]
*  Even someone like Chris Murphy, Mr. Swing at Every Pitch, he started out voting for [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1067.6s)]
*  some and he said to us, I changed my mind. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1072.1599999999999s)]
*  Interesting in real time. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1074.9599999999998s)]
*  I no longer think that we can have any leg to stand on if we're saying yes to some of [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1076.04s)]
*  this stuff. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1083.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1084.52s)]
*  And some of that is because of actions that Trump has taken has so offended people like [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1085.52s)]
*  Chris Murphy. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1090.2s)]
*  But some of it is because only in recent days has there been any attempt to organize Democratic [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1091.2s)]
*  voters to call Senate offices and tell them, vote no. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1098.44s)]
*  I want to talk for just a moment about the message that these Democrats now determined [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1102.6s)]
*  to swing at more pitches are articulating. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1107.28s)]
*  This week, we saw them try to pick their first real foil. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1111.1s)]
*  And as you're starting to hint at folks here, it wasn't as much Trump as it was Elon Musk. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1116.86s)]
*  And in some of the protests that Democratic lawmakers held across Washington over the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1125.34s)]
*  past few days, they decided to train their fury at him. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1129.1799999999998s)]
*  Let me just play a clip from somebody whose name has come up in this conversation, Senator [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1135.3799999999999s)]
*  Chris Murphy. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1138.78s)]
*  We don't pledge allegiance to the billionaires. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1139.98s)]
*  We don't we don't pledge allegiance to Elon Musk. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1143.62s)]
*  We don't pledge allegiance to the creepy 22 year olds working for Elon Musk. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1148.22s)]
*  We pledge allegiance to the United States of America. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1155.1s)]
*  Why approach this torrent of activity from the White House through the person of Elon [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1158.8999999999999s)]
*  Musk, Shane? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1166.1s)]
*  And does that seem effective? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1167.18s)]
*  I'm not sure if it's going to be effective yet. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1168.78s)]
*  But the big soul searching that the Democratic Party has been going through since the election [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1170.78s)]
*  is how did they lose ground among working class voters across the board? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1174.2s)]
*  And so in Musk, they have a billionaire foil, as you heard Chris Murphy just say, and they [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1179.0s)]
*  can say nobody voted for this guy. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1183.26s)]
*  So we might be willing to give Trump some leeway talking about those voters in the middle. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1185.22s)]
*  But we're not giving this guy any leeway. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1189.74s)]
*  And right now the party is debating not just do you take on Elon Musk, but do you take [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1192.94s)]
*  on particular programs that he's targeting? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1196.28s)]
*  USAID is something he said he wants to dismantle, unravel, get rid of. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1198.6s)]
*  Right. This has not been a kind of thing with broad popular support in the United States, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1203.52s)]
*  but it is part of the kind of agenda the Democrats have. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1207.72s)]
*  What do you do? Well, you pick the fight with Elon Musk instead of the defense of USAID. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1210.92s)]
*  Right. You mentioned USAID. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1215.48s)]
*  Reid, when I think of USAID and Democratic lawmakers standing in front of it and saying [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1217.3999999999999s)]
*  that something is wrong when the Trump administration cuts spending to the United States Agency [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1223.16s)]
*  for International Development, it makes me wonder if the Democrats do need to resolve [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  that debate over what went wrong in this last election, because foreign aid, which is what [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1235.1000000000001s)]
*  USAID is most known for, is not a top priority for voters. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1240.2s)]
*  And so it looked to some like the party was doing what it did over the past few years [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1245.92s)]
*  and not in a good way. It was speaking to its progressive base, defending the status [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1253.0s)]
*  quo on foreign aid. That is perhaps how you get the activists left motivated, but those [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1257.76s)]
*  images circulate across the country. And do they not do the party any favors? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1263.8799999999999s)]
*  It's also worth remembering that I think the protest in front of the USAID building was [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1269.8s)]
*  on Monday and the members of Congress who were there were all from the greater Washington area. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1274.04s)]
*  But a lot of the people who work in that building who are shut out are the constituents of the [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1281.6000000000001s)]
*  members of Congress from Northern Virginia and Maryland who were there. And so that was [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1286.44s)]
*  as much of a local concern for those members of Congress speaking to their own voters as [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1289.92s)]
*  it was sort of a broader national brand. By the time there was a protest in front of the [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1295.4s)]
*  Treasury building on Tuesday night, there were dozens of members of Congress from all [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1299.8000000000002s)]
*  over the country who were there. It was a much bigger sort of broader protest than the [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1304.88s)]
*  USAID one, which to me has not seemed to be sort of in the mainstream of what most of [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1309.64s)]
*  these Democrats are pushing to the center. It seems to be sort of the most engaged and [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1316.8400000000001s)]
*  frankly online Democrats are talking about and some people in Washington whose constituents [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1321.3600000000001s)]
*  work in that building. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1326.88s)]
*  So I want to now turn to something that was happening in Washington that I believe one [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1327.88s)]
*  of you raised a little bit earlier in this conversation that seems extremely well timed. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1333.5600000000002s)]
*  The Democratic National Committee met just outside Washington to make what feels like [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1338.8s)]
*  one of the most important big decisions about the party's identity since the election. And [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1342.28s)]
*  it feels like that would be very informed by the conversation we're having here. It [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1347.32s)]
*  was going to choose its next chairperson. My question to you, Reed and Shane, because [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1351.84s)]
*  I know you were both there, was did it reveal anything about these debates we've been discussing [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1357.12s)]
*  here about nature of the problem, nature of the solution for Democrats? What did it reveal [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1362.56s)]
*  about the need? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1367.36s)]
*  No, it did not. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1368.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay, Shane, why does Reed say that? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1369.4399999999998s)]
*  Let's tell you who the person they selected was to tell you why the answer is no. The [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1372.9199999999998s)]
*  person they picked is a guy named Ken Martin, who is the chair of the Minnesota State Democratic [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1377.4799999999998s)]
*  Party. And he has been in that position for years and he won the National Party chairmanship [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1382.12s)]
*  by coalition building inside the party. The party picked in a choice of insiders, perhaps [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1387.4799999999998s)]
*  the most inside candidate. Now, he's promising some potential changes, but that is not what [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1393.96s)]
*  he ran on. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1398.92s)]
*  It's important to note that when Shane and I talked with Ken Martin after he won, the [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1399.92s)]
*  things that he said to us were like the party doesn't need to change any of its policies. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1403.52s)]
*  It doesn't need to change its message. It needs to change how it distributes its message [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1409.04s)]
*  and how voters hear its message, but not the core of what the party's about. And on the [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1413.3600000000001s)]
*  What happened in the election? He promised to conduct an after action review and make [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1420.08s)]
*  it public. But when we asked him if that review would would address the question of whether [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1424.94s)]
*  Joe Biden should have run, he said, no, it would not. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1430.28s)]
*  It feels like the question of the party's identity so clearly not being resolved in [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1433.8400000000001s)]
*  this moment in a major way is likely to be resolved most clearly when the party begins [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1439.48s)]
*  to coalesce around a future leader. I wonder how much we're getting a feel for who the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1445.12s)]
*  party's next avatar might be in the crucible of this Trump blitzkrieg moment. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1451.56s)]
*  I think the history has told us the ideas and people who look like they're popping out [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1460.3999999999999s)]
*  of this moment proved to be exactly not who ends up being that person. In 2004, the last [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1465.52s)]
*  time Democrats had really lost at the same level, there was a big discussion of should [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1471.76s)]
*  the party again move to the middle and find a moderate white candidate in the era of George [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1476.56s)]
*  W. Bush. But by 2008 was a totally different candidate. It was Barack Obama who came about. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1480.6s)]
*  So I think it's too early to even have a sense of the kind of Democrat who is going to help [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1485.26s)]
*  them get out of the wilderness. But the person needs to inherit a party brand that isn't [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1489.68s)]
*  so broken that you can't run ahead of it enough to win. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1493.96s)]
*  Annie, what are you seeing? Because it seems like the loudest voices are in Congress right [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1498.5600000000002s)]
*  now, even if the next Democratic nominee might not be someone in Congress. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1502.64s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of younger senators who definitely see an opportunity to be the future [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1507.5600000000002s)]
*  leader of their party. The clip you played of Chris Murphy, that sure sounded like someone [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1513.74s)]
*  campaigning for president. There's a lot of younger, by Senate standards, lawmakers who [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1518.0800000000002s)]
*  probably look in the mirror and see an opportunity in 2028 to lead, to be the future of the party. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1524.74s)]
*  I have one final question. Does the future of the Democratic party at this moment mean [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1534.74s)]
*  or even require former Vice President Kamala Harris standing up and saying, it's not me? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1539.6200000000001s)]
*  No, I don't. I think that it's not central to the party's conversation. She will be, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1546.22s)]
*  if she chooses to run again, one of multiple candidates. She might start ahead in the polls, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1550.98s)]
*  but she is one of multiple at this point. If she's running, that's not deterring anyone [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1555.26s)]
*  else from running. The Democratic party doesn't typically go back to the well again for a [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1559.46s)]
*  person who's lost before. The Republican party has this long history of picking somebody [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1565.18s)]
*  who was a nominee or almost was the nominee. Democrats have traditionally won, and Joe [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1569.14s)]
*  Biden is the exception, by finding a fresh face. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1574.66s)]
*  Not since Adlai Stevenson has somebody had the nomination twice. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJFb94ZBuso&t=1578.62s)]
