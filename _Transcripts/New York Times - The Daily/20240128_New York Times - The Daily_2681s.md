# The Sunday Read: ‘The Whale Who Went AWOL’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV3Y9kx2Zqc)
*  What is it like for a whale to be taken out of the wild and placed in captivity?
*  I think the closest analogy is alien abduction.
*  Imagine a spaceship tearing you away from your home planet and plopping you down in
*  a completely different world.
*  captive cetaceans, that's the scientific name for whales, dolphins, and porpoises.
*  They're divorced from their native ecology, but also from their native culture, which
*  we know is passed down from generation to generation, just like in humans.
*  So trying to put a formerly captive whale back in the wild is an extremely difficult
*  process.
*  We've all seen that cinematic leap to freedom and free willy.
*  All you have to do is let him go, right?
*  But it's not like that at all.
*  Captive cetaceans are often traumatized, uniquely in between creatures, trapped between the
*  worlds of humans and whales, stuck somewhere between instinct and compliance.
*  Even when a captive cetacean manages to escape to the open ocean, they're often not fully
*  still clinging to human companionship, unsure of how to be a wild whale.
*  When that happens, who's responsible for their well-being?
*  I'm Ferris Jaber, and I'm a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine.
*  I'm often drawn to stories about nature and science, especially anything to do with the
*  living world.
*  And like many people, I first learned about this beluga whale named Voldemir through social
*  media.
*  Oh, James is videoing it.
*  Viral videos showed Voldemir playing fetch with a rugby ball.
*  That's crazy, yeah.
*  And retrieving a smartphone someone had dropped in the ocean.
*  Oh my god!
*  And borrowing a kayaker's GoPro.
*  Wow, is that cool?
*  These delightful antics made him something of an international celebrity after he appeared
*  off the coast of northern Norway in 2019, wearing a harness.
*  But I quickly discovered that behind those seemingly adorable videos was a much darker
*  reality.
*  Voldemir was a formerly captive whale.
*  He had most likely escaped from the Russian Navy.
*  There's a well-documented history of a few countries, including the US and Russia, training
*  seals and other marine mammals to assist their militaries.
*  It sounds bonkers, but it's true.
*  And in fact, despite the documentary Blackfish, which revealed to so many people the cruelty
*  of keeping whales and other cetaceans in captivity, we're still keeping something like 3600 of
*  them captive around the world.
*  We put them in tanks, force them to serve our navies and to perform in killer whale
*  shows and interactive dolphin pools.
*  And in the case of Voldemir, who escaped, no one seems to know exactly what to do with
*  him now, if anything.
*  Because he continually returns to harbors, salmon farms, and other populated areas, he
*  is in perpetual danger.
*  He has suffered multiple injuries from fishing lines and boat strikes.
*  I wanted to investigate Voldemir's predicament and try to tell his whole story through this
*  week's Sunday Read.
*  It took several years for me to get access to the people directly involved in Voldemir's
*  welfare and another year after that to report and write this story.
*  What I uncovered was an ongoing debate between government officials, scientists, and activists
*  that says a lot about our relationship with other large social and intelligent animals.
*  How we simultaneously recognize and even admire their extraordinary abilities, yet
*  feel entitled to harness those abilities.
*  To take these animals from the wild and train them to do our bidding without fully considering
*  the repercussions.
*  Humans have long been enchanted by such creatures, but in trying to possess them, to bring them
*  closer to us, we often end up tormenting them.
*  So here's my article, The Whale Who Went AWOL, read by James Patrick Cronin.
*  Our audio producer today is Adrian Hirst.
*  The original music you'll hear was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  On April 26, 2019, a beluga whale appeared near Tufjord, a village in northern Norway,
*  immediately alarming fishermen in the area.
*  Belugas in that part of the world typically inhabit the remote Arctic and are rarely spotted
*  as far south as the Norwegian mainland.
*  Although they occasionally travel solo, they tend to live and move in groups.
*  This particular whale was entirely alone and unusually comfortable around humans, trailing
*  boats and opening his mouth as though expecting to be fed.
*  And he seemed to be tangled in rope.
*  When a commercial fisherman named UR Heston got a closer look, he realized that the whale
*  was in fact wearing a harness, one strap girdling his neck and another gripping his torso just
*  behind his flippers.
*  Heston contacted a local scientist and word eventually reached the Norwegian Directorate
*  of Fisheries, which dispatched an inspector, Jørgen Rea Vig.
*  After several failed attempts by Vig and a colleague to free the beluga while on board
*  a dinghy, Heston put on an immersion suit and plunged into the water.
*  Though the whale was not quite as hefty as an average adult male of his species, he was
*  still a formidable presence, by best estimates close to 14 feet long and about 2,700 pounds.
*  Swimming beside him, Heston managed to unclasp one of the straps.
*  Together they used a grappling hook-like device to remove the rest of the stubborn harness.
*  A few days later, the beluga followed a boat to Haumerfest, one of the northernmost towns
*  in the world, where he took up residence, frequently interacting with people in the
*  harbor.
*  News of the friendly white whale spread quickly.
*  In early May, a video of the beluga went viral, eventually earning a spot on the Ellen DeGeneres
*  show.
*  In it, several young women stand on a dock in Haumerfest, speaking excitedly with their
*  hands outstretched just above the water.
*  The beluga levitates to the surface in an upright position, as smooth, plump, and silent
*  as a balloon.
*  There is something in his mouth, something rectangular.
*  Oh my god, one woman exclaims as the whale returns a smartphone her friend dropped in
*  the sea.
*  The women cheer and caress the whale, whose mouth continues to hang open.
*  Later viral videos would show him stealing and returning a kayaker's GoPro and playing
*  fetch with a rugby ball.
*  By midsummer, he had become an international celebrity, drawing large groups of tourists.
*  All the while, marine experts had been speculating about the whale's origin.
*  Clearly this animal had spent time in captivity, but where?
*  The first major clues came from the harness.
*  One of its plastic buckles was embossed with the words, Equipment St. Petersburg, and it
*  It appeared to have a camera mount, hinting at reconnaissance of some kind.
*  The beluga also knew how to closely follow boats and had a habit of wrapping rope around
*  propellers, which could suggest specialized training.
*  As several experts told media outlets at the time, the whale had most likely escaped from
*  the nearby Russian navy.
*  Based on a poll of more than 25,000 respondents, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation christened
*  the beluga Valdimir, a portmanteau of Vál, the Norwegian word for whale, and the Russian
*  name Vladimir.
*  The military conscription of a beluga whale might sound like a conceit plucked from less
*  than convincing spy fiction, but it is actually a well-documented practice.
*  Since the 1960s, Russia and the United States have trained dolphins, seals, and other marine
*  mammals to assist their naval forces by tagging enemy divers, detecting mines, and recovering
*  items from the sea floor.
*  Satellite photos of Russian naval bases near Murmansk, not far from the spot where Norwegian
*  fishermen first found Valdimir, reveal the type of sea pens often used to hold belugas.
*  Udin Rickardsen, a professor of marine biology at the Arctic University of Norway, told me
*  that international contacts have since confirmed that Valdimir belonged to the navy.
*  In the years since Valdimir first entered the global spotlight, the very qualities that
*  make him so endearing, his intelligence, curiosity, and charisma, have put him in perpetual danger.
*  While traveling along the coasts of Norway and Sweden, he has inadvertently hooked himself
*  on fishing lines and suffered multiple gashes caused by boat strikes.
*  Incessant chewing of ropes and chains has worn his teeth to nubs.
*  Overzealous spectators have swarmed him for photos, prodded him with brooms, and thrown
*  rocks in his vicinity to draw his attention.
*  Some Norwegians have threatened to seek warrants to shoot and kill the beluga because he has
*  damaged salmon farms or other underwater structures.
*  Valdimir is now at the center of a dispute over his welfare.
*  Although he has become more independent since his early residence in Hammerfest, he has
*  not completely relinquished human companionship.
*  He has retained enough survival skills to feed himself, yet he has also ventured into
*  where there are no belugas, insufficient food, and numerous threats.
*  Even as he swims freely through the ocean, he is caught in a tangle of conflicting human
*  ambitions, some noble, others misguided, nearly all distorted by inadequate understanding.
*  Whether to intervene and how to do so remain contentious subjects among scientists, activists,
*  and government officials.
*  Many advocates would like to see Valdimir reunited with wild belugas or at least moved
*  to a nature reserve.
*  But rehabilitating a formerly captive whale is nothing like the triumphant leap to freedom
*  and free willy.
*  It is more like helping a severely traumatized victim of abduction reintegrate with society.
*  For creatures of such size and sentience, confinement to relatively tiny, sparse, and
*  lonely cells exacts a heavy physical and psychological toll.
*  Like Valdimir, many captive cetaceans are in-between creatures, born to whales but raised
*  by humans, not quite domesticated but no longer wild, suspended somewhere in the middle
*  of instinct and compliance.
*  Valdimir is a living bridge between their circumscribed existence and the nearly limitless
*  one from which they were barred.
*  What happens to him now, whether he becomes a rare example of successful rewilding, transitions
*  to a more sedate life in a sanctuary, or meets a tragic end like so many of his predecessors,
*  will influence efforts to liberate the thousands of cetaceans still in confinement today.
*  Wherever Valdimir goes, he is followed by a small but passionate entourage of human
*  defenders and devotees.
*  One individual among them has become especially prominent and controversial.
*  Regina Crosby-Hogg, an American filmmaker whose entanglement with Valdimir is largely
*  a product of circumstance.
*  In 2019, after rekindling a relationship with her high school sweetheart, a Norwegian man
*  who came to her Idaho hometown as an exchange student, Crosby-Hogg started splitting her
*  time between Southern California and Norway.
*  When she learned of Valdimir, she decided to take advantage of their proximity and visit
*  him in Hammerfest, where she hoped to collect some interesting footage.
*  Their first meeting took place near a salmon farm.
*  He swam up to our boat full of people with a fish he had caught and gave it directly
*  to me.
*  Crosby-Hogg recalls, I was blown away.
*  I couldn't believe he could make that kind of connection.
*  I thought to myself, I think I just made a friend.
*  The more Crosby-Hogg learned about Valdimir, the more she feared for his future.
*  In addition to the daily dangers he faced in the water, there was little regulation
*  of the crowds that flocked to see him, and some individuals in the oceanarium industry,
*  Crosby-Hogg heard, might have their eyes on him.
*  Over time, what began as a short upbeat video grew into a feature-length production and
*  a life-consuming mission.
*  In the fall of 2019, Crosby-Hogg created an informal advocacy group called Friends of
*  Valdimir to raise awareness of the belugas plight.
*  The following summer, she officially founded the non-profit One Whale, which is dedicated
*  to protecting Valdimir.
*  Several esteemed cetacean scientists, including Ingrid Visser, Diana Reiss, and Roger Payne,
*  joined the organization as advisors.
*  Other people in Norway were falling for the whale, too.
*  In July 2021, Sebastian Strand, a burly, soft-hearted 24-year-old diver and graduate student in
*  marine biology, chanced upon Valdimir swimming circles in a harbor in Vevelstad, not far
*  from his hometown.
*  As he walked along the docks, Valdimir surfaced and approached him.
*  Strand immediately called his friend and canceled their planned fishing trip.
*  Instead, he spent the next eight hours interacting with the inquisitive whale, eventually entering
*  the frigid water in just swim trunks and a shirt.
*  By early 2022, Strand was working for One Whale full-time, in tandem with its network
*  of volunteers.
*  Strand has since devoted nearly every day to watching over Valdimir and assessing his
*  health, following him by car and boat, never knowing exactly where he might have to travel
*  next, and often sleeping in a vehicle, at a hostel, or on a kind local's couch.
*  Depending on the situation, his work has entailed public outreach, crowd control, and first
*  aid.
*  Over the past two years, Valdimir has very likely formed a stronger bond with Strand
*  than with anyone else.
*  Valdimir has opened my eyes to a new level of animal intelligence, Strand told me.
*  Over the time I have spent close to him, he has gone from a curiosity with a potentially
*  tragic background to an individual I care about deeply.
*  In many ways I see him as a person.
*  One Whale's efforts fill a vacuum created by the ambiguity of Valdimir's situation.
*  Because he is a formerly captive animal living in the wild, it's not clear who, if anyone,
*  should be responsible for him.
*  Russia has never claimed ownership of Valdimir, nor has anyone else.
*  No prominent international animal rights or conservation group has volunteered to oversee
*  his welfare.
*  In May 2019, when Valdimir was noticeably emaciated, a research group called the Norwegian
*  Orca Survey set up a program to feed him frozen herring by hand.
*  By fall, fecal samples indicated that Valdimir was learning to catch live fish for himself.
*  Since then, the Directorate of Fisheries has maintained a position of mild indifference,
*  insisting that Valdimir is a wild Whale and can fend for himself.
*  When Crosby Hogg founded One Whale, she already suspected that chasing a Whale through the
*  ocean and trying to keep him out of trouble would not be a sustainable strategy.
*  In parallel, she began pursuing an alternative solution, recapturing Valdimir in order to
*  save him.
*  The controversy surrounding Valdimir is part of a much larger debate concerning the ethics
*  of cetacean captivity.
*  Humans have been resting whales from the ocean and keeping them in tanks since at least the
*  1860s, when P.T. Barnum exhibited live belugas in Boston and New York.
*  At the time, many Westerners perceived whales as monsters that could be hunted, displayed,
*  and discarded without misgivings.
*  Since then, research has established that cetaceans are self-aware, empathic, and highly
*  intelligent beings, many of whom form lifelong relationships and maintain genuine forms of
*  culture.
*  A growing number of countries, including France and Canada, are now banning all future cetacean
*  breeding and captivity.
*  Some aquariums and marine mammal parks have already agreed to retire and rehabilitate
*  their orcas, belugas, and dolphins.
*  Many of these changes have been spurred by increasing social pressure.
*  In the past three decades, and especially since the harrowing 2013 documentary Blackfish,
*  the public has become much more critical of cetacean captivity, which can result in both
*  deformities and behavioral abnormalities.
*  While there are few verified accounts of wild orcas harming humans, captive orcas have attacked
*  of times and in several cases have killed them.
*  Yet an estimated 3,600 whales, dolphins, and porpoises still live in confinement around
*  the globe.
*  Since at least the mid-2000s, scientists, conservationists, and some oceanariums have
*  been trying in earnest to establish what many experts agree are necessary and viable alternatives
*  to standard captivity, open water sanctuaries.
*  An ideal cetacean sanctuary should be sheltered but still part of the ocean.
*  It should be large, remote, and untrafficked, yet still small and accessible enough to staff
*  and manage.
*  In other words, exactly the kind of place that humans like to keep for themselves.
*  This was the predicament the whale sanctuary has been trying to achieve since the early
*  2000s.
*  This was the predicament the whale sanctuary project, an American non-profit, confronted
*  when it began searching for a site to establish a haven for orcas and belugas.
*  Following years of staunch opposition from local residents and fishermen, the organization
*  finally found one bayside town in Nova Scotia that welcomed their proposal for a 100-acre
*  sanctuary.
*  They are currently acquiring the necessary permits, a process that has spanned more than
*  two years, and they don't yet have any whales confirmed for rehoming.
*  In 2016, the National Aquarium in Baltimore announced plans to develop a sanctuary for
*  its six Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins, but it has also encountered numerous hurdles,
*  including projected storm surges and other dangers that climate change will ultimately
*  impose on captive creatures with such long lifespans.
*  It took a hard look at the Florida Keys, says John Racinelli, president of the National
*  Aquarium, but the hurricanes of 2017 opened our eyes to the fact that we'll likely be
*  caring for a succession of dolphins across many decades.
*  Our facility still needs to be functional in 2100.
*  Merlin Entertainments, a global operator of theme parks and other attractions, has been
*  developing an eight-acre beluga sanctuary in Iceland since 2012.
*  In 2019, Merlin and its various partners transported two belugas from a Shanghai aquarium to a
*  bay on the remote island Hémai, the same bay that housed Caico, the orca that starred
*  in Free Willy during his attempted rehabilitation in the late 1990s.
*  As with parallel efforts, the environment has been problematic, especially in winter.
*  Jeff Foster, a cetacean welfare expert who worked with Caico in Iceland, recalls wind
*  gusts up to 200 miles per hour and strong waves that displaced nets.
*  Equally challenging has been the complexity of cetacean psychology.
*  One of the belugas is struggling to adjust to life in the sea, perturbed by the unfamiliarity
*  of currents, tides and even rain.
*  Because of her hesitancy, combined with harsh winter conditions and health troubles, the
*  belugas have spent most of the past four years living in an indoor pool in a landside facility.
*  Within weeks of meeting Valdimir, Crosby Hogg began contacting every cetacean sanctuary
*  she could find, but none were willing or able to house a fugitive beluga.
*  Eventually she consulted Rick O'Berry, a renowned environmental activist.
*  In a previous life, O'Berry captured dolphins for the Miami Seaquarium and trained them
*  to perform in the 1960s TV series Flipper.
*  In 1970, one of the show's starring dolphins died in his arms after failing to resurface
*  for air, an incident he interpreted as suicide.
*  Unlike most mammals, cetaceans must consciously choose to breathe.
*  The experience changed him forever.
*  O'Berry and his son Lincoln have since established what are, in some respects, the most successful
*  cetacean sanctuaries in the world.
*  Working with the Indonesian government and a local non-profit, the O'Berries created
*  two permanent facilities in Bali and Karimunjawa for the retirement, rehabilitation and release
*  of former dolphin performers.
*  The facilities, situated in sheltered coastal areas, consist of wooden sea pens in which
*  dolphins unlearn their captive behaviors and develop the skills they need to survive in
*  the wild, like hunting and deep diving.
*  Since 1973, the O'Berries have rehabilitated and released more than 20 dolphins in various
*  parts of the world, a majority of which they are confident reintegrated with wild pods.
*  Crosby Hogg initially asked Rick O'Berry to spearhead the effort to save Valdimir
*  so that she could focus on her documentary, but he declined because he was too busy with
*  his own projects and skeptical that the Norwegian government would offer the necessary permissions
*  and assistance.
*  Instead, he encouraged Crosby Hogg to lead the campaign herself.
*  Shortly thereafter, she approached the mayor of Hammerfest about creating a new reserve
*  to rehabilitate and release Valdimir and other belugas.
*  After all, Valdimir had already enchanted the citizens of Hammerfest and the town itself
*  was surrounded by pristine arctic habitat.
*  The mayor connected her with Katrina Nass, a destination developer for a local tourism
*  company.
*  Regina was really good at selling this as an opportunity that could be a win-win, Nass
*  says.
*  Everyone wants to be the town that saved Valdimir.
*  In August 2022, Nass, Crosby Hogg and several colleagues founded a non-profit called the
*  Norwegian Whale Reserve, which has been trying to realize their mutual ambitions ever since.
*  The project's proposed location is a 200-acre fjord about 22 miles southwest of Hammerfest.
*  Running it into a reserve would require stretching thousands of feet of net across its mouth
*  and securing it all to the seafloor.
*  Such nets need to be flexible enough to accommodate waves and tides, while also remaining taut
*  enough that they don't bunch up and trap the animals.
*  You might think a whale or dolphin would swim or jump over any barrier level with the ocean's
*  surface, but most cetaceans seem to have a mental block that prevents them from doing
*  so.
*  The climactic leap in Free Willy was accomplished by strapping an animatronic whale to a rocket
*  launcher.
*  This is not a sea pen, Nass says.
*  Our ambition is to make a beautiful open sea reserve where there is no civilization, no
*  traffic, ideally just pure nature.
*  We want to set an example for the rest of the world.
*  Norway is a somewhat unlikely choice for a cetacean sanctuary.
*  It is one of only three countries, along with Japan and Iceland, that continue to engage
*  commercial whaling.
*  Polling suggests that most Norwegians have consumed whale meat at some point and that
*  less than a quarter of the population supports an immediate end to whaling.
*  There is also a major bureaucratic obstacle.
*  Norwegian law stipulates that a wild whale cannot be held captive unless it is part of
*  a zoo or scientific study, neither of which is particularly compatible with a model sanctuary.
*  Although the Hammerfest Municipal Council has not yet officially sanctioned a reserve,
*  it voted in favor of conducting preliminary environmental tests of the proposed site.
*  So far the results are encouraging, indicating exceptionally clean water.
*  The largest sanctuaries in development can each hold 10 to 20 cetaceans at most, a tiny
*  fraction of the world's captive population.
*  I asked Lincoln O'Berry why it was taking so long to do so little.
*  He explained that among all performing animals, whales and dolphins, in particular orcas,
*  are uniquely lucrative.
*  The estimated market value of a single captive orca is between $1 million and $10 million,
*  many times the typical selling price of an elephant, a tiger or a great ape.
*  I don't see any aquarium giving up that kind of asset, he told me.
*  There have been sanctuaries and releases going on for all kinds of terrestrial species and
*  the whole oceanarium industry is trying to make it sound like it's not possible.
*  Whales and dolphins are basically the last animals on earth that have to perform seven
*  days a week until they die while living in a completely barren box without even a rock
*  to hide behind.
*  For cetacean welfare advocates, each passing year without an adequate network of cetacean
*  sanctuaries permits the possibility of further tragedy.
*  Last March, the Miami Seaquarium announced a legally binding agreement to relocate a
*  female orca named Lolita, who had been in captivity since 1970, to a reserve in her
*  native Salish Sea.
*  Five months later, while still occupying an 80-foot long tank in Florida, Lolita died
*  from kidney failure.
*  Her ashes were packed into a white box painted with an exact replica of her tail and topped
*  with cedar boughs, flown to Washington State and given to members of the Lummi Nation,
*  who consider Lolita, or Scalichactinot as they call her, to be their relative.
*  In a private ceremony in September at a sacred site, Scalichactinot finally returned to the
*  sea.
*  Belugas were once thought to have a maximum lifespan of about 50 years.
*  The latest research suggests that they can live for close to a century.
*  Valdimir's physical characteristics indicate that he is probably a young adult between
*  12 and 20 years of age.
*  Had he remained in the wild from birth, he would have spent his life traveling the seas
*  with his kin in groups of two to ten and herds of more than one thousand, communicating through
*  complex vocalizations that scientists have only begun to decode, and learning how to
*  be a whale from his elders.
*  He would have had a family, a dialect and the Beluga equivalent of a name, a signature
*  contact call, rather than another species pun.
*  Instead, he was probably abducted as a calf, severed from cetacean culture and forced to
*  undergo military training in exchange for food.
*  In all likelihood, he either escaped from a damaged sea pen or was accidentally separated
*  from the navy during a training exercise.
*  Last spring, perhaps because of a muddled migratory instinct or the drive to find a
*  mate, Valdimir began an unprecedented journey south.
*  In the past, following his departure from Hammerfest, he primarily lingered around remote
*  salmon farms in northern Norway, where he learned to hunt the wild fish that gathered
*  to eat spilled food pellets.
*  He would often stay in a single location for months, allowing Strand to mediate relations
*  between Valdimir and local salmon farmers.
*  By April, Valdimir was speeding down the coast of Norway, rarely staying in any one place
*  for more than a few days.
*  On May 19th, he reached Oslo.
*  A few days later, he was spotted off the coast of Sweden, the first time since 2019 that
*  he had crossed another country's borders.
*  All the while, he was swimming farther from food-rich and relatively tranquil waters toward
*  larger and more dangerous harbors.
*  At times, he entered industrial zones and murky canals, exactly the kinds of places
*  in which solitary cetaceans tend to get stuck.
*  Even before his unexpected voyage, Valdimir's behavior had been changing.
*  Beyond his newfound wanderlust, he became less interested in following boats and hanging
*  around humans compared with previous years.
*  He appeared to be growing wilder all on his own.
*  Because of this evolution, the escalating threat to Valdimir's well-being and the absence
*  of a suitable sanctuary, One Whale revised its strategy.
*  In partnership with the Norwegian animal rights organization, NOAA, One Whale is now petitioning
*  Norway's government to relocate Valdimir directly to Svalbard, an archipelago about
*  halfway between the Norwegian mainland and the North Pole, with the nearest resident
*  population of wild belugas.
*  One Whale hired Jeff Foster to write a detailed report explaining how to transport Valdimir
*  by ship or plane.
*  The Norwegian fisheries director, Frank Bakkjonsen, told me he is open to the idea if One Whale
*  and its partners can secure the necessary permits and funds.
*  This tactical shift is one of several recent developments that strained the already fraught
*  alliance between Crosby Hogg and her scientific advisors.
*  Moving Valdimir to Svalbard may well be his best chance of reuniting with wild belugas,
*  but several experts I interviewed expressed serious concerns about the plan.
*  Beluga societies tend to be highly dynamic and accepting, wild belugas have even adopted
*  lone narwhals, but the Svalbard population is small, insular, and non-migratory.
*  Given Valdimir's mysterious origins and how much time he has spent away from his kin,
*  there's no guarantee that the Svalbard belugas will welcome him, especially if he was caught
*  in the distant Sea of Okhotsk, where the Russians reportedly acquire many of their military
*  cetaceans.
*  He might also introduce foreign diseases, pathogens, or unfavorable genetic mutations.
*  Moreover, Svalbard's remoteness and extreme weather make the expedition itself arduous
*  and costly, not to mention stressful and disorienting for a beluga.
*  Even if transport is successful, Valdimir would ideally require a period of acclamation
*  on site before release, which would mean obtaining legal authorization to construct a temporary
*  enclosure and maintaining it in potentially harsh conditions.
*  In order to determine Valdimir's fate, scientists would have to secure tracking devices to his
*  steel rods, a procedure that sometimes causes significant wounds and infections.
*  "'I'm always in favor of getting animals into a more natural scenario, but you have
*  to do it on a case-by-case basis,' says Ingrid Visser, a whale scientist who is known for
*  her studies of orcas and spent several weeks observing Valdimir.
*  "'It has to be driven by the welfare of the animal first and foremost, and it has
*  to be backed by robust and compassionate science.'"
*  Last summer, following intense disagreement over Valdimir's future, a majority of One
*  Whale's scientific advisors, including Visser and every other cetacean expert, resigned.
*  By September, Strand had left as well.
*  She was a very talented and talented scientist, and she was a very successful scientist.
*  She was a very talented and talented scientist, and she was a very successful scientist.
*  She was a very talented and talented scientist.
*  She was a very talented and talented scientist.
*  She was a very talented and talented scientist.
*  She was a very talented and talented scientist.
*  She was a very talented and talented scientist.
*  She was a very talented and talented scientist.
*  One Whale unraveled because of one person, says Stephen McCulloch, a longtime marine
*  mammal welfare specialist and former One Whale advisor.
*  From my perspective, the problem was that you had a very controlling individual who
*  had very little integrity or respect for a group of experts that really wanted to help.
*  It became evident that Regina's priority was to make a film with a satisfying ending,
*  Beluga's swimming off together in the sunset.
*  But you can't film an animal that died because you didn't understand enough about him.
*  Crosby Hogg denies prioritizing her film over Valdimir's welfare and claims that there
*  is a proactive effort to disparage her.
*  She says that McCulloch and others who left repeatedly proposed interventions that were
*  unacceptable to One Whale.
*  It is appropriate that he and others are no longer associated with us, she says, because
*  there are major differences in philosophy.
*  After leaving One Whale, Strand founded his own organization, Marine Mind, to independently
*  monitor and protect Valdimir.
*  Most of the experts who resigned from One Whale, including Visser, McCulloch, and Reiss,
*  are now assisting Marine Mind, as are many of its former volunteers.
*  Following these departures, One Whale hired the marine biologist Ana Victoria Pinovina
*  as its new lead of science and research.
*  The choice is controversial because Vina, who strongly supports the Svalbard proposal,
*  is also involved in a study on cetacean physiology that some conservationists have called
*  cruel and pointless.
*  The ongoing research entails stretching nets across a known migration route in order to
*  trap young mink whales and using superficial electrodes to test their hearing.
*  Vina and her collaborators maintain that the study is justified because it may ultimately
*  improve efforts to protect baleen whales from noise pollution.
*  But critics counter that the experiments are unnecessarily stressful to the animals and
*  point out that a loose net has already entangled and drowned a passing whale.
*  This past fall, Valdimir reversed his southward trend and crossed back into Norway, where he
*  is living around salmon farms and steadily regaining weight.
*  Many of the experts I interviewed, while struggling to identify a clear solution to Valdimir's
*  current situation, tentatively favored a kind of detached watchfulness, refraining from
*  social interaction and intervening only in emergencies.
*  In contrast, Reis, a professor of psychology at Hunter College, who has long studied cetacean
*  cognition and communication, thinks that Valdimir is a strong candidate for a sanctuary because
*  he is still too habituated to humans and thus exposed to undue risk.
*  For his part, Strand says he is undertaking a research and development phase to determine the
*  best strategy.
*  In the meantime, tensions between one whale and marine mind are becoming somewhat disruptive.
*  Valdimir has recently interfered with or damaged propellers, sensors and other equipment at the
*  commercial salmon farms he frequents.
*  In the past, employees on site were willing to deal directly with Strand to minimize Valdimir's
*  mischief.
*  Now, pressured by rival organizations whose members make conflicting statements, some farmers
*  have instead referred him to their company's public relations departments.
*  To be completely candid, Strand told me, it's a mess.
*  When I began reporting this article, Valdimir had not yet commenced his southward odyssey.
*  By the time I connected with one whale on the ground in late July, he was already in Sweden.
*  I had told my editors that, although there were no guarantees, the likelihood of meeting
*  Valdimir was high.
*  I was nowhere near prepared for just how challenging the trip would be.
*  Because Valdimir does not have any tracking devices, the task of finding him depends on
*  social media posts and a tip line.
*  We spent more than a week searching for him by car, train and boat, hindered by strong winds
*  and rough seas, often arriving at his last known location too late to encounter him.
*  Exhausted, over budget and faced with the prospect of even worse weather in coming days,
*  I reluctantly accepted that it was time to return home.
*  Just one hour before I planned to head to the airport while I was still aboard one whale's
*  rented catamaran, a report came in.
*  Someone had spotted Valdimir in a harbor on a small island about 20 miles northwest of
*  Gothenburg.
*  By a stroke of luck, we were only 30 minutes away.
*  When we arrived at the harbor, Valdimir was gliding just beneath the surface, an indistinct
*  milky shape, noiseless and ghost-like.
*  Close to two dozen spectators wandered the docks, trying to get a better look.
*  Within seconds of our arrival, Valdimir swam toward us.
*  Crosby hogs stood near the edge of our boat in a black wetsuit, waving and calling out
*  in that lilting, high-pitched voice reserved for pets and infants.
*  Valdimir, hello, she said as the whale swam directly below us.
*  I'm coming, baby, I'm coming.
*  Stay with us.
*  For the next hour, Valdimir followed our vessel and several others through the sheltered waters
*  within the surrounding cluster of islands.
*  At first, he remained largely underwater, reaching only momentarily to breathe.
*  Gradually, he began to bring his bulbous head above the surface, turning it from side to
*  side as he inspected us with beady black eyes.
*  His intelligence and curiosity were palpable.
*  Whereas most whales and dolphins have fused neck bones and fixed expressions, belugas
*  can flex their heads and alter the shape of their mouths, making them particularly expressive.
*  By the time Valdimir had returned to the central pier, a substantially larger crowd had
*  gathered.
*  Children and adults alike thronged the docks, dangling feet and hands in the water, hoping
*  to touch the celebrity's cetacean or at least get a photo.
*  Valdimir was docile and playful, swimming right up against people's shins, allowing
*  them to pet his head and back and repeatedly offering the underside of his flipper for
*  a high five, one of many tricks he presumably learned in captivity.
*  Crosby Hogg pulled her blonde curls into a ponytail and entered the water, swimming
*  alongside Valdimir and explaining how to interact with him safely.
*  It's okay to touch him, she said at one point, just not his eyes or his blowhole.
*  When other people tried to get in the water, she cautioned them.
*  We're with his science team, she said, and it's not recommended to swim with him.
*  I'm just letting you know that.
*  Today we're seeing how much fat he has.
*  You see this shallow part underneath his blowhole?
*  That means he is losing too much weight.
*  There's not enough fish in the water down here, so we're trying to get him back up
*  to Norway.
*  A little while later, Crosby Hogg enticed Valdimir to stay near the catamaran, away
*  from the crowd.
*  She played with him for about an hour, throwing small white buoys for him to fetch and allowing
*  him to nudge her around.
*  Eventually she decided it was time to leave the harbor and encourage Valdimir to follow
*  the catamaran north.
*  We loosened the ropes, tying the boat to the docks and motored away.
*  Valdimir swam alongside us, undulating tirelessly just beneath the surface, the hum of the engines
*  punctuated by his powerful exhalations.
*  The farther we traveled, however, the more difficult it became to keep Valdimir at our
*  side.
*  He was easily distracted, veering from the water, and he was able to see the water.
*  He was distracted, veering away to inspect other vessels.
*  Frustrated by repeated interruptions, Crosby Hogg started to yell at passing boats, waving
*  her arms and warning them to stay away.
*  Like many celebrities, Valdimir has lived a life defined by other people's desires.
*  Almost everyone he has met wants something from him, a snapshot, a story, a lifetime
*  of submission.
*  One of the most tragic aspects of his predicament is the discrepancy between how much he has
*  adored and how little has been accomplished to secure his long-term welfare.
*  Valdimir ostensibly offers our species a chance at redemption, a formerly captive whale
*  already moving freely through the ocean, requiring only some redirection to reunite with his
*  kind.
*  But the enormity of what we have done to him and so many other sentient beings like him
*  severely complicates and in some cases prohibits such a reversal.
*  Valdimir is so far displaced from his origins, geographically, ecologically, culturally,
*  that it's not clear whether a homecoming is still achievable.
*  From ochre bison painted on cave walls to the elephants in Europe's medieval menageries
*  to ongoing killer whale shows and interactive dolphin pools, humans have long been enamored
*  with other large, social and intelligent animals.
*  We love them because they are simultaneously familiar and exotic, because they both mirror
*  us and represent ways of being beyond our ken.
*  We have often expressed our passion for such creatures by trying to possess them, by fitting
*  them with collars, roping them into circuses and placing them behind glass.
*  Even the military conscription of marine mammals is a kind of admiration or at least recognition
*  of their extraordinary abilities.
*  Yet the closer we have pulled such animals toward us, the more difficult it has become
*  to deny the torment that our proximity inflicts.
*  Perhaps the purest act of love is to leave them alone in the first place.
*  After traveling about eight miles northwest of the harbor where we first found Valdimir,
*  he began to slow down and trail off more frequently, possibly losing interest, stamina or both.
*  As we approached a town called Scherhamn, he vanished amid choppy water.
*  Studying the ocean surface in the quickly fading light, you could easily mistake the
*  white crest of a wave or a patch of foam for a dorsal ridge or fluke.
*  On a hunch, we searched a nearby harbor where we glimpsed Valdimir tugging his ship's ropes.
*  Seconds later he slipped beneath the slate blue sea.
*  With little recourse in the dark, we found a place to dock, hoping rather helplessly
*  that the world's most famous beluga, the half-wild whale we had chased for more than
*  a week and who half-heartedly chased us back for all of an hour, might decide to stay with
*  us through the night.
*  The next morning, he was nowhere to be seen.
