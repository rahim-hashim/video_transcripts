# Gavin Newsom on the LA Protests, Trump’s Response and Why It’s a Defining Moment for Democracy
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA)
*  Over the past few days, as federal immigration raids in Los Angeles led to widespread protests [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=0.0s)]
*  in the city, and finally to the deployment of federal troops to contain those protests, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=6.32s)]
*  nobody has been more central to the story than California's Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=12.56s)]
*  And so I spoke with Governor Newsom about how, in his mind, we got to this point, the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  stakes of this situation, and how he thinks it will come to an end. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=23.48s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=28.6s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=36.36s)]
*  How's this? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  You guys hear me? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  Yes, Governor. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for coming on The Daily. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=44.64s)]
*  A pleasure. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=45.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=46.64s)]
*  I've never heard of it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=47.64s)]
*  I had to look it up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=48.64s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=49.64s)]
*  We're going to cut that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=50.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=52.64s)]
*  Governor Newsom, thank you for making time for The Daily. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=53.64s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  I want to start by asking you to describe the situation right now on the ground in Los [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  Angeles, both in terms of protests and the deployment of federal troops. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=65.24s)]
*  Let's start, Governor, with the protests. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=70.96s)]
*  Yeah, nominal. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=73.4s)]
*  I'm literally here at the Reagan building. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=75.56s)]
*  I'm in downtown LA. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=77.16s)]
*  Just be another typical day. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=79.52s)]
*  But there's some pockets of modest activity in this four or five square blocks. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=81.64s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=87.08s)]
*  Under control, we had 1,610 police officers patrolling last night, 227 arrests. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=88.08s)]
*  So there's certainly more activity in the evening. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=95.48s)]
*  But the activity today that's deeply alarming are all these raids that are happening all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=97.6s)]
*  across the state of California, Tulare County, and Fresno County, and Ventura County here [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=103.0s)]
*  in Los Angeles, and Home Depots, and car washes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=107.56s)]
*  Today, they're going to clinics, to community clinics where people are trying to get healthcare, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=110.28s)]
*  their families. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=116.64s)]
*  You're describing immigration raids by federal officials. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=117.64s)]
*  Immigration raids, yeah, stopping people while they're in their cars, checking papers all [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  across now this country, not just here across our state. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=126.2s)]
*  We're going to talk about those raids in a moment. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=130.72s)]
*  But let me check in on the state of the military deployment ordered by President Trump in Los [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=133.0s)]
*  Angeles. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=139.52s)]
*  You're saying protests at this hour, 2.44 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday are minimal, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  nominal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=147.8s)]
*  What is the state of the military deployment in LA? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=149.0s)]
*  Well, the president a number of days ago commanded 2,000 National Guard. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=151.56s)]
*  I want to put that in perspective. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  California, I command 18,000. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=161.08s)]
*  So 2,000 National Guard, the 79th Infantry. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=164.4s)]
*  Two days later, there were about 315 that actually were mission tasked. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  The rest were sitting around, about 1,700 for days. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=174.22s)]
*  You saw them sitting quite literally on the ground without fuel, without water, without [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=178.1s)]
*  food, without training. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=182.82s)]
*  So you have about 50 to 100 National Guard out there last night. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=184.3s)]
*  We had 1,600 local law enforcement, including 700 that I directly command under the California [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=188.18s)]
*  Highway Patrol specialty units that were trained and are trained for these activities. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=194.94s)]
*  They're the ones making the arrest, not the National Guard. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=200.66s)]
*  Today we estimate that now they've mission tasked about 1,000 of the original 2,000 to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=203.34s)]
*  do support work or direct. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=211.54s)]
*  It's hard to tell. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=214.7s)]
*  And you saw photos of Pete Hexett just tweeted out someone getting arrested, handcuffed with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=216.02s)]
*  the National Guard. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=222.42s)]
*  They had their guns drawn based upon the Secretary of Defense. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=224.42s)]
*  It looks like they're right there at these raids. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=228.42s)]
*  You seem to be saying, Governor, that these troops are not doing all that much and it's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  the Los Angeles and state Highway Patrol officials who are the ones bringing the situation under [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=237.06s)]
*  control and to the degree that federal troops are doing anything, you see them doing something [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=243.98s)]
*  related to the raids, not the protests. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=248.77999999999997s)]
*  I want to step back. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=252.5s)]
*  I revere these guys. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=254.06s)]
*  I've had the privilege of a lifetime to be their commander in chief. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=255.74s)]
*  I've got hundreds of them down at the border for years and years. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  I've put them down at the border. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=263.9s)]
*  We're doing counter drug operations. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=265.5s)]
*  We have what we call these rattlesnake crews. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=267.64s)]
*  These are the ones doing forest management. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=269.46s)]
*  They're raking the forest, preparing for wildfire season. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=271.1s)]
*  These are men and women, this is important for people to know, that actually work for [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=274.5s)]
*  local law enforcement agencies in many cases. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  They're police officers in their day jobs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=280.66s)]
*  They've been pulled off the border. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=282.46s)]
*  Three quarters of our rattlesnake teams doing vegetation management have now been redeployed [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=284.5s)]
*  and they've been taken out of police departments. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=289.78s)]
*  The first night they were deployed, our police officers had to protect the National Guard. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=292.86s)]
*  They became a destination for the protests and it was local police that actually had [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  to protect them. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=305.97999999999996s)]
*  That's how ridiculous this whole thing is. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=307.38s)]
*  This is theater. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=311.3s)]
*  It's madness. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=312.86s)]
*  It's unconstitutional. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=314.1s)]
*  I've said it's immoral. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=315.1s)]
*  It puts people's lives at risk and they're using these brave men and women as pawns. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=316.82s)]
*  That said, the new operation seems to be more tactically focused on active ICE raids and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=321.02000000000004s)]
*  now they're being utilized in a very different posture, which is clearly a violation of the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=329.88s)]
*  law. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=334.18s)]
*  I wonder, Governor Newsom, if you can tell the story from your perspective as somebody [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=335.46s)]
*  very much at the center of this all, of how we got to this place. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=342.02s)]
*  I want to take you back for just a moment to late last week. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=348.62s)]
*  There were a series of raids. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=352.98s)]
*  Those raids seemed to create a chain of communication among people who were upset about them that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=354.86s)]
*  led to these protests. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=359.94s)]
*  We ended up all seeing the images of what those protests in some cases led to. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=364.5s)]
*  Folks waving Mexican flags. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=371.7s)]
*  We had way most the driverless taxi cars on fire. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=373.56s)]
*  There was some vandalism. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=378.02s)]
*  There was some looting. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=379.34s)]
*  In your mind, did these protests ever get out of control? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=381.82s)]
*  Well, that looting was unacceptable. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=386.26s)]
*  There have been hundreds and hundreds of arrests, including, as I said, 227 arrests last night. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=388.22s)]
*  They're reviewing tape. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=393.7s)]
*  They're making their case, created a unit in the district attorney's office. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=395.82s)]
*  They should be prosecuted at full extent of the law. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=399.42s)]
*  There's some bad people doing terrible things, and they need to be called out and they need [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=401.86s)]
*  to be held to account, period, full stop. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=405.46s)]
*  Law enforcement did make those arrests. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=407.38s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds of additional people beyond just the 227 last night have been arrested [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=410.18s)]
*  and many, many more will be arrested. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=413.9s)]
*  just a small complex in a very small footprint in a very large downtown. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=418.24s)]
*  How small? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=424.36s)]
*  I mean, just for those people who aren't as familiar with Los Angeles, obviously, as you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=425.36s)]
*  are, how small? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=427.88s)]
*  You're talking about a complex of a few buildings and you're talking about a few blocks. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=430.44s)]
*  And I don't say this lightly. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=434.44s)]
*  I've been down here the last four days. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=436.32s)]
*  I'm right downtown myself. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=438.64s)]
*  And I wish I could pull the camera and you can take a look at what's going on. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=441.04s)]
*  There are tons and tons of peaceful protesters, but those images were disgraceful. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=444.8s)]
*  Those images of those way most reactions of a few people were disgraceful and they were [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=450.2s)]
*  weaponized by the Trump administration and they've exacerbated the problem. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=455.64s)]
*  Those people should be ashamed of themselves and they will be held to account. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  You're saying local officials know how to deal with this kind of unrest. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  You're not saying that there wasn't unrest. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=468.44s)]
*  I want to talk about in this chronology, the moment you end up speaking with President [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=470.68s)]
*  Trump, because it's pretty close to the moment that he decides that he's going to send the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=476.2s)]
*  National Guard into LA, that he's going to federalize it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  Does that come up? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=487.24s)]
*  It didn't. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=488.24s)]
*  It didn't appear to me when I talked to him. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=489.24s)]
*  He never brought it up. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=490.56s)]
*  Period. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=491.56s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=492.56s)]
*  He lied about that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=493.56s)]
*  This is last Friday. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=494.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=495.56s)]
*  He claimed he did. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=496.56s)]
*  You claim. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=497.56s)]
*  He lied. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=498.56s)]
*  He lied. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=499.56s)]
*  I'm going to tell you something. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=501.44s)]
*  When I say this, he lied. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=502.44s)]
*  Stone cold liar. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=503.44s)]
*  Don't think for a second he told the truth. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=504.44s)]
*  He lied. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=506.52s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=507.52s)]
*  He continues to lie. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=508.52s)]
*  I'm not going to talk about a private conversation with the President of the United States out [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=509.52s)]
*  of respect. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=512.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=513.44s)]
*  I value that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=514.44s)]
*  I'll just say this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=515.44s)]
*  It was an incredibly cordial conversation and there were a number of issues that were [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=517.36s)]
*  discussed. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=522.52s)]
*  I'll remind you at the time, he was in a process Friday of defunding California. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=524.52s)]
*  He was looking to defund the university system. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=530.8s)]
*  Our conversation was about the activities that occurred on Friday. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=535.0s)]
*  It was brief. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=541.38s)]
*  It lasted maybe five seconds into it when I was talking about a few arrests and he immediately [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=543.04s)]
*  pivoted to all of these other topics. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=551.72s)]
*  That was it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=554.1999999999999s)]
*  Period. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  What Governor were you thinking when you learned, I guess within 24 hours, maybe even less than [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  that of having been on the phone with him, perhaps this was on his mind, perhaps it wasn't, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=561.28s)]
*  that he had suddenly federalized the National Guard over which you preside and was going [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=565.76s)]
*  to deploy them on the streets of LA? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=570.84s)]
*  Came completely out of left field. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=572.48s)]
*  No warning, no heads up, no nothing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=574.64s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=576.84s)]
*  Let me color it in a little bit more. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=577.84s)]
*  Please. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=579.64s)]
*  I talked to the president, obviously talked to the mayor about what was occurring down [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  there. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=585.52s)]
*  I was in Northern California at the time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=586.52s)]
*  I was connected with Susie Wiles, the president's chief of staff. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=590.16s)]
*  We exchanged a number of text messages back and forth about the imperative of collaborating [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=595.16s)]
*  and working through all of this. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=600.72s)]
*  Then I talked to the president. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=604.48s)]
*  Years later, to your point, I wake up and I'm Newscum again. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=606.88s)]
*  Newscum is the nickname he gives you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=611.88s)]
*  It's the president of the United States calling someone Scum, Newscum, which is for what it's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=614.28s)]
*  worth what I think a seventh grader used to call me on Baltimore Street in Corneam-Madeira, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=622.08s)]
*  California. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=630.36s)]
*  He begins the day with that and then talks about the National Guard and then starts making [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=631.36s)]
*  up all these things he claimed he told me about, which honestly starts to disturb me [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=636.48s)]
*  on a different level that maybe he actually believed he said those things. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=640.9200000000001s)]
*  He's not all there. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  I wasn't saying that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  He's not all there, you just said. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=649.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  It's honestly, he literally a few days later talked about a conversation he had with me [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=652.84s)]
*  after he announced his 700 US Marines to be deployed for domestic law enforcement in the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=657.4s)]
*  United States of America. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=663.52s)]
*  It's blatantly against law. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=664.72s)]
*  He claimed he had another conversation with me. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=666.34s)]
*  Once this deployment is announced, you said that it was unnecessary. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=668.98s)]
*  You went further and you said that the National Guard, this is before the Marines were deployed, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=673.6600000000001s)]
*  would inflame the situation. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=678.1s)]
*  Is that in your mind what happened? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=679.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=681.9s)]
*  I mean that's not my assessment. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=682.9s)]
*  That's assessment of all law enforcement officers and officials that we were meeting with on [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=685.26s)]
*  a consistent basis at the Emergency Operations Center. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=689.4200000000001s)]
*  They said this is exactly the opposite of what he, by the way, none of them were coordinated [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=693.34s)]
*  with. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=697.74s)]
*  What's the evidence of it? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=698.74s)]
*  What do you mean evidence? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=699.74s)]
*  They were a destination for protesters. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=701.64s)]
*  They became a destination. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=704.1s)]
*  What's the evidence? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=705.38s)]
*  We had to, and I'll remind you, I'll just repeat what I said. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=706.38s)]
*  We had to defend the National Guard. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=709.02s)]
*  We had to use our own law enforcement to protect them. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=711.38s)]
*  That's the evidence. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=715.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean just think about how perverse that is. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  And then he announces another 2,000, which are more law enforcement officers that are [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=718.98s)]
*  being taken off the street, more people are being taken away from the border, is now no [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=723.1s)]
*  longer doing that public safety work because of his actions. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=726.78s)]
*  I think, Governor, this brings us to Tuesday night when you decide to deliver a major speech [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=730.98s)]
*  about all this. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=736.78s)]
*  And in that speech, you describe what the president did, the deployment of these troops [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=738.32s)]
*  based on the situation on the ground, and in your mind the disproportionate nature of [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=743.94s)]
*  that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=748.74s)]
*  As a defining moment for your state, for the country, and for our democracy. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=749.9s)]
*  Why in your estimation this moment is the moment to call the president out as you have [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=756.26s)]
*  and to suggest that some Rubicon has perhaps been crossed when it comes to, and these are [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=765.1s)]
*  your words, an abuse of power or authoritarianism, because there have been a lot of moments over [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=770.8199999999999s)]
*  the past few months in which the president has used his power in new and at times extraordinary [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=775.74s)]
*  ways. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=781.82s)]
*  I'm thinking of his pursuit of law firms, universities, at times even the federal judiciary [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=782.82s)]
*  when it has ruled against him and he has disliked it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=787.5s)]
*  So why for you is this the defining moment? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=790.44s)]
*  And all of those things I called out last night in that speech. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=794.54s)]
*  So I agree with you. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=798.22s)]
*  I think it's a red line when you're using military that are trained for foreign incursions [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=799.78s)]
*  to do domestic law enforcement in American cities. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=805.78s)]
*  I think that's a red line. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=808.9s)]
*  If that's not a red line, I don't know what red lines mean. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=810.14s)]
*  This is the United States military being used for domestic law enforcement. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=813.38s)]
*  Police not allowed to police. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=818.38s)]
*  Now we have to address the issue of the military coming in and militarizing the streets of [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=821.22s)]
*  the United States of America, sending fear and chills up the spines of law abiding citizens [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=828.3399999999999s)]
*  that are scared to death now of going to graduations to see their kids graduate, scared to death [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=835.3399999999999s)]
*  to walk down the street to get groceries, scared to death to get a dental appointment [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=841.66s)]
*  or go down a community clinic to check in on their fever. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=847.9s)]
*  That's a red line crossed. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=852.78s)]
*  I don't know what the hell else, you know, what, and excuse my language, but it's to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=856.22s)]
*  find a serious and profound moment in American history from my humble perspective. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=862.26s)]
*  Have you heard from the president since you gave that speech, since you essentially accused [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=869.4200000000001s)]
*  him of operating outside the bounds of democracy? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=873.1800000000001s)]
*  I have not. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  And I'm someone, I'm someone that some of your viewers and listeners may know, have [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=878.3000000000001s)]
*  no problem meeting with people and talking to people I disagree with, including the president [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=884.78s)]
*  himself. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=889.98s)]
*  As I said, we had a very cordial conversation on Friday night. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=890.98s)]
*  It wasn't the first conversation I've had. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=894.5s)]
*  I was out here on the tarmac with him or in the midst of the fires as he was calling for [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=896.54s)]
*  my removal of office. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=901.26s)]
*  I mean, he called for my arrest the other day. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=902.26s)]
*  President United States calling for the arrest of a political opponent who happens to be governor. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=904.9s)]
*  And I would, I would pick up the phone in a nanosecond. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=908.3s)]
*  What did you make of the fact that he, that he did seem to suggest that you should perhaps [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=911.78s)]
*  be arrested? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=915.78s)]
*  Well, you know, I guess I'm being fair. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=916.78s)]
*  I didn't even call that a red line. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=920.4599999999999s)]
*  That might be a red light for some people listening. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=924.5s)]

*  That same Kristi Noem? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1048.74s)]
*  It's serious. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1050.98s)]
*  These are authoritarian tendencies. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1052.38s)]
*  This is thuggish behavior. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1054.72s)]
*  We're going to return to these immigrants a little bit later in our conversation. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1056.5s)]
*  I want to finish with your speech in which you did everything we just talked about and [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1061.8600000000001s)]
*  you called on Americans to stand up to Trump right now. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1068.6200000000001s)]
*  And you even suggest that to not stand up to Trump is to be complicit. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1073.2600000000002s)]
*  And I wonder what situation that puts you in. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1078.34s)]
*  It seems like a potentially tricky one, right? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1085.98s)]
*  I mean, you want protesters to be peaceful. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1088.4199999999998s)]
*  You want those who commit violence to be prosecuted. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1092.56s)]
*  You're now simultaneously asking people to fight back against Trump, presumably in places [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1096.4199999999998s)]
*  like L.A., but perhaps not just L.A., perhaps in Chicago, San Antonio, New York, on and [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1102.5s)]
*  on. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1107.54s)]
*  Are those messages in conflict? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1108.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if they're in conflict. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1110.82s)]
*  I mean, society becomes how we behave. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1113.74s)]
*  We are behavior. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1117.3s)]
*  I think people that care about this country, people care about knowledge and culture and [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1118.86s)]
*  history. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1124.42s)]
*  People care about their kids and grandkids or dare I say, people care about the Constitution [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1125.5s)]
*  of the United States and the rule of law. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1129.5s)]
*  I think we need to wake up that what he wants is our silence. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1133.06s)]
*  And if we're silent about that, then we are complicit as we see these fundamental rights [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1139.38s)]
*  erode. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1146.58s)]
*  And so I'm not trying to call people out. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1149.34s)]
*  Let's not over read what I'm saying. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1152.3s)]
*  We were very explicit about peaceful protests, very explicit about calling out those criminal [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1154.98s)]
*  elements. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1162.1s)]
*  But I also think we need to be very explicit about the moment we're living in in the United [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1163.3799999999999s)]
*  States of America. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1167.54s)]
*  It's shock and awe. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1168.54s)]
*  It's overwhelming. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1169.76s)]
*  And I just want folks to understand that we will lose this democracy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1171.6999999999998s)]
*  It's 141 days. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1176.4199999999998s)]
*  We will lose it so much faster than people think if we are silent. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1178.84s)]
*  And so I just pray that people don't give in. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1184.34s)]
*  This was the final words I said to cynicism, to their own fear and anxiety, that they're [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1186.62s)]
*  the antidote to that as long as they don't give up. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1192.3799999999999s)]
*  It just occurs to me that the protests in LA were peaceful until they weren't, right? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1196.82s)]
*  And in calling for more potentially protests, doesn't that necessarily invite more opportunities [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1202.78s)]
*  for violence? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1211.7s)]
*  Well, I guess we can all just go home and just watch this whole thing, this whole extraordinary, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1214.02s)]
*  you know, I said it, this endearing idea that our founding fathers, the best of Roman Republic [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1218.8200000000002s)]
*  and Greek democracy, co-equal branches of government, popular sovereignty, the rule [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1225.94s)]
*  of law, completely erode. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1230.78s)]
*  That's an option. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1232.42s)]
*  I mean, that's a choice. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1233.42s)]
*  I'm not going to make that choice. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1234.42s)]
*  And I was calling for people that may think more like me to say, don't make that choice. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1236.02s)]
*  And he wants you to make that choice. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1241.42s)]
*  The reason he threatened the arrest, the reason he's so aggressive, wants to defund [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1243.74s)]
*  California is we punch above our weight. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1247.6200000000001s)]
*  We're the fourth largest economy in the world. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1249.98s)]
*  We continue to thrive despite him. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1251.9s)]
*  And his entire theory of his case is contradicted by our success and our resilience. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1254.46s)]
*  He doesn't like the resistance coming from California. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1260.14s)]
*  He doesn't like the fact that we've sued him 24 times. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1262.94s)]
*  He doesn't like the fact that I push back. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1266.42s)]
*  You can't work with them. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1270.02s)]
*  You can only work for them. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1271.34s)]
*  I've tried to work with them. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1272.5s)]
*  Well, my gosh, I did during COVID. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1273.74s)]
*  I continue to try. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1276.1s)]
*  But it's challenging. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1279.1399999999999s)]
*  And so I want to challenge people to express themselves in a peaceful way. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1281.1399999999999s)]
*  And we're seeing it across the country. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1286.42s)]
*  It's not a novel theory to stand up and step up. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1287.94s)]
*  It's a foundational constitutional theory that's been practiced for hundreds of years. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1291.3799999999999s)]
*  And I don't want it to disappear. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1295.9s)]
*  Governor, I want to zoom out now for just a bit. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1297.9s)]
*  You have been on a pretty interesting journey since the election. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1301.3400000000001s)]
*  You hinted at this earlier in our conversation. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1305.5400000000002s)]
*  You've been openly searching for the right way to navigate the second Trump presidency. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1309.38s)]
*  And it started with a message of conciliation, a real willingness, as you said, to work with [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1313.94s)]
*  the president and interest in cooperation. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1320.1000000000001s)]
*  And beyond that, you expressed a real curiosity about what was at the center of Trump's appeal. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1322.58s)]
*  You spoke on your podcast to Charlie Kirk, to Steve Bannon. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1327.6999999999998s)]
*  Has the past week, have these events made you rethink what's possible in that vein? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1331.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, I also spoke to someone who was active participant trying to get me recalled, Newt [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1339.82s)]
*  Gingrich, and someone who's actively participating in these ICE raids, Dr. Phil, this last week [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1345.26s)]
*  on the podcast. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1351.76s)]
*  Dr. Phil went and embedded with some of the raids. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1352.76s)]
*  I just think it's incredibly important. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1354.88s)]
*  So you're still doing it in the midst of this, you're saying, reaching out to those who are [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1356.8s)]
*  who I am. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1361.32s)]
*  I think I think a little humility, a little grace, you know, I think we're all a little [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1362.32s)]
*  bit better off learning from people we disagree with and having civil. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1369.56s)]
*  I'm trying to have civil conversations. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1374.1200000000001s)]
*  I know it offends a lot of people. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1375.64s)]
*  I get all that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1377.08s)]
*  It's just not who I am. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1378.08s)]
*  I'm trying to have civil conversations with the president again, including just a few [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1379.08s)]
*  days ago. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1381.72s)]
*  What have you learned, especially when it comes to the question of undocumented immigration? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1382.72s)]
*  This may offend some people that we all want to be loved and we all need to be loved. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1386.8s)]
*  We all want to be respected. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1391.6399999999999s)]
*  We're all being heard. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1392.6399999999999s)]
*  And so I don't know that we're all human and that we have deep disagreements. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1394.08s)]
*  It's a strange thing to say with the midst of all this, where I'm being threatened with [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1399.84s)]
*  and calling out these authoritarian tendencies of Donald Trump to say this. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1404.32s)]
*  But at a certain point, we've got a divorce is not an option. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1409.1599999999999s)]
*  We got to come back together. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1413.48s)]
*  And so that's by the way, that's just me being who I am. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1414.56s)]
*  A lot of folks don't know me. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1417.4399999999998s)]
*  They think they know me. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1418.82s)]
*  There's a caricature of me. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1420.48s)]
*  But this is my this is what I do in private. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1422.24s)]
*  I have enormous respect for people I disagree with. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1424.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm not naive. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1427.6399999999999s)]
*  You think I think I'm a convince them of something. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1428.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe if I convince them of anything is, is that, you know, that at least I have to strike [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1431.16s)]
*  the character to listen to someone I disagree with. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1436.96s)]
*  If there's nothing else, maybe it's just that. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1440.36s)]
*  And I'm learning from these guys. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1442.32s)]
*  I learn a lot. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1443.6s)]
*  It's interesting learning from Charlie Kirk and how he organized the troops for Trump. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1444.72s)]
*  I think Democrats can learn from that. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1449.84s)]
*  And some people may reject that and say, we're doing great. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1453.64s)]
*  Democrats were just were morally superior. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1457.56s)]
*  We're smarter. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1460.2s)]
*  And eventually people will figure it out. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1461.2s)]
*  Well, right now, I'm trying to figure out how to keep this democracy up and deal with [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1462.76s)]
*  the militarization of my streets because this guy is running this country right now without [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1466.92s)]
*  any oversight because we lost the House. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1472.1200000000001s)]
*  We lost the Senate. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1475.68s)]
*  And I don't want to lose my country. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1476.68s)]
*  And I'm counting on the damn courts. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1478.68s)]
*  To that point, one of the ways that President Trump has reliably outmaneuvered his opponents [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1481.3600000000001s)]
*  and gotten to the place you just described where he controls the White House, the Senate, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1486.36s)]
*  House of Representatives and faces very few checks on his power is by putting Democrats [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1490.6799999999998s)]
*  in very difficult situations where they can end up on what looks like the wrong side of [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1497.08s)]
*  a polarizing issue in a very public way. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1502.32s)]
*  And it can be argued, and obviously I want to know what you think about this, that Trump [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1504.56s)]
*  is doing that to you and California Democrats right now, given the dynamic he has created [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1508.4399999999998s)]
*  and your response. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1515.0s)]
*  So how in this situation, let me just explain what I mean, do you end up, Governor, not [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1516.28s)]
*  appearing to be on the side of protesters who have at times been violent and against [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1520.16s)]
*  the deportation of illegal immigrants? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1527.32s)]
*  Well, I think we're trying to answer that in real time together. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1531.32s)]
*  I think my words, actions the last few days tried to address that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1536.84s)]
*  But let me address this by taking a broader view. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1540.68s)]
*  They've been shape shifting the conversation for years and years and years, everything [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1545.68s)]
*  with three letters, CRT, DEI, ESG, IRS, DOJ, they've weaponized, they were shape shifting [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1549.1200000000001s)]
*  the conversation, they're weaponizing grievance. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1556.16s)]
*  And we continue to chase it, Democrats, we continue to be on the back end of all of this. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1558.8400000000001s)]
*  They've been winning for years and years and years. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1564.64s)]
*  And so we've got to get on the offense. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1567.52s)]
*  We've just we've got to disabuse ourselves that we can continue down the path we're on [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1570.0s)]
*  of communication and engagement. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1574.3999999999999s)]
*  Look, we all live in these bubbles, this filter bubble online, and obviously, just complete [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1576.76s)]
*  bullshit and propaganda coming from Fox. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1583.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, what a joke and total manipulation of facts, truth, and the distrust that they [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1585.3999999999999s)]
*  sow. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1591.0s)]
*  So I'm not naive about all the folks that are watching those networks and how they feel [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1593.1599999999999s)]
*  about this. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1599.4399999999998s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1600.4399999999998s)]
*  They feel like we own the libs. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1601.4399999999998s)]
*  They're playing riot. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1602.8s)]
*  This is exactly what we want. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1603.84s)]
*  Trump's going to look strong. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1604.84s)]
*  He's going to be out there in his little birthday suit on Saturday. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1606.08s)]
*  And he's going to do his dictator Kim Jong Un parade and try to one up Putin so Putin [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1610.12s)]
*  feels threatened, weakness. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1615.04s)]
*  That's all that is, is masquerading in strength. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1617.48s)]
*  And I get that. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1620.56s)]
*  I'm not naive about that. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1622.28s)]
*  But I'm not backing down. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1623.6399999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to continue to push back and I'm going to stay on the offense. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1625.24s)]
*  And that's why I go on Fox. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  That's why I meet with these guys. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1632.38s)]
*  Well to the point of Democrats trying to meet people where they are, one issue where Republicans [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1633.98s)]
*  keep winning in the Trump era is immigration. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1638.5800000000002s)]
*  And Democrats seem to many Americans a little slippery on this subject. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1641.9s)]
*  So I want to pin you down directly. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1646.7s)]
*  Where do you stand and where should the Democratic Party stand on the question of illegal immigration? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1650.1000000000001s)]
*  Who should be allowed to stay and who should be deported? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1655.5400000000002s)]
*  You have expressed in this conversation a lot of sympathy for those who were caught [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1658.28s)]
*  up in the raids across California over the past few days. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1662.1399999999999s)]
*  Well I have no sympathy for folks that commit violent criminal acts. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1668.56s)]
*  And let me give you a proof point. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1674.76s)]
*  There's not a governor you will meet with that can say what I'm about to say. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1677.32s)]
*  And I've been criticized by my party. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1681.6399999999999s)]
*  My legislature on multiple occasions has tried to usurp my authority to coordinate and collaborate [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1684.44s)]
*  with ICE, which I've done over 10,500 times since I've been governor to go after people [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1690.54s)]
*  that are here that commit life crimes. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1697.96s)]
*  We coordinate and we collaborate with them. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1700.92s)]
*  We've been doing that for years and years and years. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1702.72s)]
*  You're talking to a governor that put almost 400 National Guard down at the border. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1704.72s)]
*  I mentioned a moment ago, Donald Trump has taken our National Guard off the border and [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1709.4s)]
*  he's now moving them into the streets of LA. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1714.76s)]
*  But LA does not cooperate with ICE. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1718.44s)]
*  It's a sanctuary city. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1720.6000000000001s)]
*  You have sanctuary cities that are different than the framework and posture at the state level. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1721.8400000000001s)]
*  There are different rules and regulations going back decades and decades. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1727.68s)]
*  But let me go back because I want to answer your question. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1731.5s)]
*  You specifically asked about posture on the issue of immigration, which is broader than [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1734.0s)]
*  sanctuary. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1739.24s)]
*  Sanctuary is a byproduct of the failure of the federal government to reform the immigration system. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1740.24s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember the bipartisan border bill of just a few months ago that, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1743.56s)]
*  by the way, included some money for the border wall. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1748.04s)]
*  People forget that. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1750.52s)]
*  And so we have a strategy and pathway, but it's been weaponized. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1752.02s)]
*  And now people are being demonized to the second part of your question. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1755.64s)]
*  Yes, I have deep empathy, deep empathy for someone who's been here 10, 15, 20 years that's [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1758.72s)]
*  living and all they want to do is live their lives out there. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1764.88s)]
*  And I think that's why I think the federal government is contributing and is part of [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1767.52s)]
*  our community, the vibrancy of our community being assaulted and attacked. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1771.52s)]
*  How many kids literally are missing their graduation in the next few days because of [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1776.52s)]
*  these actions? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1780.52s)]
*  Scared to death because grandma may get deported. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1781.52s)]
*  And so, yeah, I'm worried about our communities. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1784.52s)]
*  But get rid of the criminals. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1788.52s)]
*  I have no problem with that. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1789.52s)]
*  Well, you know, it's signaling to it. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1790.52s)]
*  Responsible. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1792.52s)]
*  Do not cooperate with ICE. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1793.52s)]
*  Do not let them into their jails where there are undocumented criminals. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1794.52s)]
*  Is it your position that they should? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1799.52s)]
*  Because the understanding we have gathered here at The Times through our journalism and [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1801.52s)]
*  reporting is that because ICE can't get to some of the places they want to go to find [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1806.52s)]
*  criminals in jails and places like LA, they are doing the raids at the Home Depots, doing [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1811.52s)]
*  the raids that you're finding so problematic. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1816.52s)]
*  Perhaps you disagree with that. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1819.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think there's some truth to that. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1820.52s)]
*  But come on. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1824.52s)]
*  I mean, none of us naive. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1825.52s)]
*  They also use that as an excuse to randomly go to Home Depots, to randomly go to car washes [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1826.52s)]
*  and people that are running into neighborhoods because scared to death. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1832.52s)]
*  So look, LA's approach is different than the approach I took as mayor of San Francisco. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1836.52s)]
*  As governor of California, I have a different approach than the city's, including my whole [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1842.52s)]
*  city, San Francisco. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1848.52s)]
*  I coordinate with ICE as it relates to dangerous criminals. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1849.52s)]
*  Beyond immigration, Governor, do you think there's a way in which by pushing back as [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1854.52s)]
*  forcefully against the administration as you clearly are right now, you're drawing more [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1859.52s)]
*  fire for your state and in turn potentially putting the people you're saying you're trying [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1864.52s)]
*  to protect at greater risk? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1869.52s)]
*  We've seen, you know this, what retribution looks like from this president. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1872.52s)]
*  Come on. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1876.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1877.52s)]
*  I was involved in 122, California's involved in 122 lawsuits, the prior administration [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1878.52s)]
*  when we were quote unquote getting along. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1883.52s)]
*  I mean, no one's naive. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1885.52s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1886.52s)]
*  Donald Trump in the conversation on Friday, we were talking about the fact he was defunding [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1888.52s)]
*  California before he talked about bringing the National Guard. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1894.52s)]
*  And he could further defund. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1897.52s)]
*  He was already taking these actions. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1899.52s)]
*  He was already coming after us. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1901.52s)]
*  I was already involved in two dozen lawsuits prior. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1903.52s)]
*  So come on. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1905.52s)]
*  None of us are naive. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1906.52s)]
*  All of us knew this was coming. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1908.52s)]
*  And again, I was the guy playing nice with Donald Trump, right? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1910.52s)]
*  And this still happens. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1913.52s)]
*  So no, we're not fools. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1915.52s)]
*  None of us are. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1917.52s)]
*  At the end of the day, I want to know how you think this all comes to an end. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1919.52s)]
*  Because from where I sit, the president has greater leverage over you than you have over him. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1925.52s)]
*  Ask Elon Musk. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1934.52s)]
*  He's sitting there feebly apologizing. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1936.52s)]
*  The punishment can run deep. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1939.52s)]
*  And so how does this lopsided battle end well for you and California? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1941.52s)]
*  Well, there's formal authority and there's moral authority. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1949.52s)]
*  The more you exercise your formal authority, the less you have of it, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1953.52s)]
*  the more you exercise your moral authority, the more abundant it becomes. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1958.52s)]
*  And so I hope we're flexing some more authority here. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1962.52s)]
*  And I just want more expressions of that. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1966.52s)]
*  We have plenty of formal authority. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1969.52s)]
*  We're the size of 21 state populations combined. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1971.52s)]
*  We're unbelievably well resourced. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1973.52s)]
*  We provide $83.1 billion to the federal government to pay their bills more than we receive. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1976.52s)]
*  Compare that to the $71.1 billion Taker state like Texas. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1982.52s)]
*  We dominate in every major industry. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1987.52s)]
*  Dominate in every major industry. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1990.52s)]
*  We punch above our weight. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1992.52s)]
*  Would you ever withhold or encourage Californians to withhold all that tax money? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1994.52s)]
*  You're going to threaten to take our money. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=1998.52s)]
*  Yeah, we're looking at some levers. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2000.52s)]
*  But, you know, it's not the rule of Gavin. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2004.52s)]
*  There's a rule of Don. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2007.52s)]
*  I believe in the rule of law. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2008.52s)]
*  Looking at some levers, one lever that's always been out there is that the governor of California [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2010.52s)]
*  has a number of boycotts, tells people in California not to pay their federal taxes. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2016.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that puts those taxpayers at risk. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2019.52s)]
*  I would never do that. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2023.52s)]
*  Now, people can make decisions for themselves, but that should not be the policy of the state. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2025.52s)]
*  So what other levers do you have? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2029.52s)]
*  How creative are you willing to be? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2030.52s)]
*  Well, I'm trying to be creative and we're looking. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2032.52s)]
*  And I have a team of people looking creatively. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2034.52s)]
*  Of course, that process had about 12 hours to unfold before this process unfolded. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2036.52s)]
*  So let me just say this. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2041.52s)]
*  How this ends? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2043.52s)]
*  Donald Trump stands down. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2044.52s)]
*  How this ends? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2046.52s)]
*  American people stand up. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2047.52s)]
*  How this ends? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2049.52s)]
*  The rule of law. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2050.52s)]
*  Triumphs. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2052.52s)]
*  We're going to be in court tomorrow. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2054.52s)]
*  TRO, requesting federal judge as it relates to our emergency order. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2055.52s)]
*  You're trying to sue your way out of this deployment. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2062.52s)]
*  Well, I'm trying to persuade people that there is a way out of it. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2066.52s)]
*  And it's called active, not inert citizenship. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2071.52s)]
*  I was quoting Justice Brandeis. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2073.52s)]
*  In a democracy, the most important office. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2075.52s)]
*  Sorry, Don. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2077.52s)]
*  Donald. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2078.52s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2079.52s)]
*  It's not the office of presidency. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2080.52s)]
*  It's the office of citizen. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2081.52s)]
*  And I'm really proud of people standing up in these protests and people peacefully protesting. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2082.52s)]
*  People need to see that. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2089.52s)]
*  It inspires other people. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2091.52s)]
*  And people feel like they're not alone. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2093.52s)]
*  Again, the alternative here is if we're just quiet, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2096.52s)]
*  if we just put our head down, maybe it will all go away. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2099.52s)]
*  Maybe if we don't talk to people we disagree with, maybe they won't exist. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2103.52s)]
*  You know, you got to deal with the cards that are dealt. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2107.52s)]
*  And right now, you know, you're right. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2112.52s)]
*  We may not have a stronger hand. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2116.52s)]
*  The president of the United States of America. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2118.52s)]
*  I'm just hoping he acts like one or he reads about one. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2120.52s)]
*  And that we still have one at the end of his four years. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2125.52s)]
*  Well, Governor, thank you for your time. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2131.52s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2135.52s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2136.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTLKFojoYAA&t=2155.52s)]
