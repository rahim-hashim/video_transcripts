# J.F.K., the C.I.A. and the Original ‘Deep State’
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  For the past three decades, when the U.S. government has released documents related [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=12.68s)]
*  to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an overriding goal has been to dispel conspiracy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=17.02s)]
*  theories. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=23.96s)]
*  But as my colleague Julian Barnes explains, President Trump's motivation for releasing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=25.52s)]
*  the latest batch is far more complicated. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=31.2s)]
*  Today, what we learned from those new documents and why they may actually fuel even more conspiratorial [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=35.6s)]
*  thinking. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  It's Thursday, March 27th. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=56.52s)]
*  Julian, you're the intelligence reporter for the Times. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=60.52s)]
*  So I'm curious what your relationship has been to arguably the biggest and most enduring [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=70.08s)]
*  conspiracy theory about the agency you cover. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  That the CIA was behind the killing of the president. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=82.28s)]
*  The assassination of JFK. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=86.28s)]
*  Yeah, that one. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=87.28s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=88.8s)]
*  Well, like all Americans, it's loomed really large for my entire life, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=89.8s)]
*  I mean, this is something that everybody talks about generation in, generation out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=96.28s)]
*  I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous to the establishment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=101.36s)]
*  That movie, JFK, came out when I was in college and... [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=105.28s)]
*  Please be seated. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  In that movie, Oliver Stone posits that there is a dark conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=111.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  President Kennedy was murdered by a conspiracy that was planned in advance at the highest [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  levels of our government and it was carried out by fanatical and disciplined Cold Warriors. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=124.12s)]
*  That it was the CIA that Oswald didn't act alone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=129.8s)]
*  Y'all better start thinking on a different level like the CIA does. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=133.8s)]
*  Now we're through the looking glass here, people. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=138.12s)]
*  White is black and black is white. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=141.28s)]
*  And I remember, I was like, wow, this could be true. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=148.0s)]
*  Maybe this shadow agency could have done something like that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=152.64s)]
*  This infuses so much, you know, why was the CIA covering up what they knew about Oswald? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=161.08s)]
*  What was the CIA doing in the 1960s? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=168.48s)]
*  Into the 1970s. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=171.24s)]
*  This is the kind of foundational myth of the CIA and the CIA's relationship with Kennedy [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=173.08s)]
*  is hugely important in the history of the agency and how we understand the agency today. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  Suffice it to say, young Julian Barnes and now modern day Julian Barnes sounds very primed [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=184.28s)]
*  for the moment just a few days ago when the United States government at the direction [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  of President Trump releases thousands and thousands of pages of these super secret documents [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=198.0s)]
*  related to the JFK assassination. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=204.16s)]
*  So what, given that history, was your first impression when you finally had a chance to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=207.04s)]
*  really make sense of them? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=214.28s)]
*  Well not to spoil the episode, but the CIA did not kill JFK. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=215.96s)]
*  We have not learned that there is a second gunman. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=222.2s)]
*  There is no significance to the Grassy Knoll. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=225.8s)]
*  Oswald acted alone. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  But that doesn't mean this release is not important, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  There are interesting new details about spycraft, about how the CIA operated, and how they operated [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=234.72s)]
*  outside the guardrails put on by a democratic government. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  How they exceeded their charter. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=248.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's what's important about this today. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=251.84s)]
*  That's kind of why these documents are coming out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  We have a president who has consistently questioned the role of intelligence agencies in society. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=257.68s)]
*  He's constantly attacking forces arrayed against him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=264.48s)]
*  By putting this out, by exposing this old history about the bad acts of the CIA, one [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  could reasonably argue that he's trying to reinforce the idea that there is a threat [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  from something he would call the deep state. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  Well we're going to get to that and get to how the documents that were just released [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=286.72s)]
*  may or may not reinforce that concept. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  But just to start, can you tell us the backstory behind this document release? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=294.44s)]
*  As you've hinted at, there have been releases of JFK documents throughout the last half [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=300.6s)]
*  century or so. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=306.72s)]
*  So where did these specific documents come from? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  What's that story? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=313.16s)]
*  So it starts at the time of the assassination itself. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=314.16s)]
*  Americans have a lot of questions. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=318.04s)]
*  How could one solitary gunman do this? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=319.96s)]
*  How could one bullet hit the president and the governor of Texas? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  There were breadcrumbs and hints. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=328.8s)]
*  People knew about the tensions between Kennedy and the CIA over the failed Bay of Pigs invasion [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=330.66s)]
*  of Cuba. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=337.52s)]
*  Right, which the CIA had overseen and botched. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=338.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  So the public wants answers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  And the clamor leads to a government commission, the Warren Commission, which investigates [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=346.4s)]
*  the killing of John Kennedy and comes to a conclusion that few Americans accept, which [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=354.64s)]
*  is that Oswald acted alone. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=362.76s)]
*  And so the questions persist and there are more and more commissions of congressional [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  investigations, each of which generates a lot of documents, some about the Kennedy assassination, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=371.28s)]
*  some about other programs. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  But in the course of these investigations, we learn about all kinds of other CIA abuses. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=380.35999999999996s)]
*  Like what? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=386.4s)]
*  Project Mockingbird when they were tapping the phones of journalists. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=387.4s)]
*  MKUltra where they were putting LSD into the drinks of unsuspecting Americans to find out [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=392.28s)]
*  whether they could practice mind control on the Soviets. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  These were limited programs, but they were wrong. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=403.92s)]
*  They were outside the CIA's mandate and they became part of the public consciousness of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=407.8s)]
*  a agency that was a little out of control, that was spying on Americans and not operating [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  within limits. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=420.48s)]
*  So in the public imagination, all of this kind of comes together, whether it's the abuse [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=421.8s)]
*  of a CIA mind control experiment or a wiretap of a reporter in Washington. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=427.3s)]
*  It all comes merged with the original questions about was the CIA involved in Kennedy's assassination? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=433.90000000000003s)]
*  But more and more information is accumulated, some of which is released and much of which [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  is kept locked in the CIA's vault. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=449.70000000000005s)]
*  And they're all kept locked away until Oliver Stone makes his movie JFK, the one I saw in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=452.42s)]
*  college. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=459.38s)]
*  And the movie ends with a message about how the Kennedy assassination records are locked [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  away for decades. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=466.06s)]
*  And it serves almost like a call to action. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=468.5s)]
*  So people start calling Congress. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=471.94s)]
*  And Congress passes a law that mandates the whole trove of documents about the Kennedy [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=476.38s)]
*  assassination, but also about broader CIA activities gets released and it lays out a [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=481.78s)]
*  timetable to push the documents out to the public. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=487.34s)]
*  And the timetable for the law is 25 years. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=491.58s)]
*  And so across various presidential administrations, documents are being released. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=494.98s)]
*  And the deadline to declassify and release these documents from all these government [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=501.38s)]
*  inquiries basically ends up in the first Trump administration. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=506.62s)]
*  The final final deadline. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=511.26s)]
*  The final deadline for the last of the documents. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=512.78s)]
*  But at that time, Trump listens to the CIA and they ask him, can you withhold the names [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=517.78s)]
*  of officers, the names of sources, protect some of our tradecraft? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=524.14s)]
*  And he accedes to those wishes. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=530.02s)]
*  And the documents released in 2017 had many redactions. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=532.14s)]
*  So just explain how we get from the Trump who is compliant with the CIA and agreeing [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=537.06s)]
*  to all the redactions to the Trump of this past week or so who oversees the release of [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=543.52s)]
*  this final batch with no redactions. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=554.06s)]
*  And I'm guessing part of the answer is the extraordinary souring of Trump's relationship [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=556.5s)]
*  with the intelligence community since his first term. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=563.74s)]
*  So just to say, there's a super tiny tranche of documents that are still under court seal. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=567.58s)]
*  But yes, the vast, vast majority of the documents have no redactions and are now public. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=574.66s)]
*  But to answer your question, part of it is Trump's antipathy to the intelligence agencies, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=580.36s)]
*  his worries about the deep state, which have become much more central to his messaging [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=587.04s)]
*  over the years. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=591.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=592.3000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=596.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=597.0s)]
*  We won. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  And right before his second inauguration, he vows to do something. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  He says he'll order the release of the remaining documents about the assassination of President [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=606.66s)]
*  Kennedy. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=612.26s)]
*  As the first step toward restoring transparency and accountability to government, we will [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=613.26s)]
*  also reverse the overclassification of government documents. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=617.28s)]
*  And in the coming days, we are going to make public remaining records relating to the assassinations [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=622.22s)]
*  of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=628.36s)]
*  He frames this as a way to restore public trust in government, but part of it is also [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=633.62s)]
*  his new alliance with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=639.6s)]
*  We need to have more transparency in our government, and he's keeping his promise. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=642.74s)]
*  R.F.K. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=647.66s)]
*  Jr. is the son of Kennedy's attorney general, the New York senator and presidential candidate [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=648.66s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=655.54s)]
*  And throughout R.F.K.'s life... [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=656.96s)]
*  The day that my uncle was killed, the first phone call that my father made after J. Edgar [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=659.1s)]
*  Hoover told him that his brother had been shot was to the CIA desk officer. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=664.78s)]
*  And my father said to him, did your people do this? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=671.9s)]
*  The questions about what the CIA did, what role the CIA had in his uncle's death, have [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=675.3000000000001s)]
*  loomed large. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=682.36s)]
*  It was my father's first instinct that the agency had killed his brother. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=683.36s)]
*  R.F.K. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=688.9s)]
*  Jr. is somebody who very much believes the CIA was involved in his uncle's death. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=689.9s)]
*  There's millions of pages of documents. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=696.14s)]
*  There's a six-year cover-up. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=699.8199999999999s)]
*  And he is a very strong voice in this administration pushing for a much grander release of information. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=702.22s)]
*  And of course, he's kind of pushing on an open door in Trump, given his relationship [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=711.18s)]
*  with the intel community. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=715.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=717.14s)]
*  People are waiting for this for a long, for years, for decades. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=718.14s)]
*  Trump is ready to push out these documents. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=724.8199999999999s)]
*  And everything will be revealed. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=727.54s)]
*  And he signs an executive order ordering the JFK documents to be released. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=729.6999999999999s)]
*  And then last week, they make public a huge trove, 77,000 pages, almost all of it digitized [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=739.36s)]
*  on the web. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=746.5s)]
*  And gone are most of the redactions. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=747.82s)]
*  No white boxes, no black boxes. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=750.42s)]
*  Now it's finally out there for the public to see. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=753.86s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=770.3s)]
*  So Julian, tell us what we learn when these redacted boxes are wiped away and everything [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=778.38s)]
*  that had been previously hidden in these JFK documents suddenly is revealed. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=785.3s)]
*  Well, some of what had been hidden was hidden for good reason, like the Social Security [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=790.06s)]
*  numbers of hundreds of congressional staffers. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=794.94s)]
*  Who had worked on previous investigations? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=798.46s)]
*  Yeah, who had been on the committee in the 70s or the House Committee on the Assassinations. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=800.34s)]
*  One of the church committee members was Joseph deGenova, a Trump campaign lawyer. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=807.3s)]
*  And he was hopping mad that his Social Security number was out there. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=812.5s)]
*  I mean, it was a huge mess. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=815.7s)]
*  The administration immediately had to say they were going to take the really unusual [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=817.66s)]
*  step of issuing new Social Security numbers, something they very rarely do, to the affected [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=821.66s)]
*  people. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=828.66s)]
*  This is an example of, you know, stuff that didn't need to come out there, doesn't serve [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=829.9s)]
*  any investigator. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=834.38s)]
*  But the speed of which they were moving and the directive, remove all the redactions, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=836.22s)]
*  you know, led to some second order effects. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=842.02s)]
*  So when it comes to the central question we have been exploring here of what new information [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=844.66s)]
*  is in these formerly redacted spaces in these documents, beyond Social Security numbers, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=851.34s)]
*  what did you find? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=857.66s)]
*  Well, one of the most interesting documents, which was titled CIA Reorganization, was from [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  Arthur Schlesinger, a key aide to John Kennedy. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=865.6999999999999s)]
*  This document had been out before, but what was hidden from view and is now apparent is [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=869.78s)]
*  the pure depth of the CIA spy work in France. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=876.62s)]
*  You know, half of the embassy in France was CIA officers, not diplomats. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=882.1s)]
*  So people you would think are working for the State Department in a diplomatic capacity [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=888.94s)]
*  are actually just spies for the CIA. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=893.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and this is the larger point of this memo, which is that the CIA is taking over [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=895.02s)]
*  U.S. foreign policy. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=901.62s)]
*  It's out of the control of the president and the secretary of state because the CIA's role [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=903.7s)]
*  has grown too big. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=910.26s)]
*  This is the kind of information the CIA keeps secret even today. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=912.78s)]
*  How many people they have overseas, where they're stationed, how many officers are in [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=916.5799999999999s)]
*  each embassy. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=922.18s)]
*  And so you can see why when President Trump in his first term released these documents, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=924.0999999999999s)]
*  this information was redacted. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=932.3399999999999s)]
*  Even though it was old, this goes to how they operate, and they really like to keep those [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=934.9399999999999s)]
*  secrets out of the view of the public. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=941.18s)]
*  What seems fascinating about this, not only is that it reveals the reach of the CIA within [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=945.54s)]
*  what we think of as the civilian corners of our government, like the State Department, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=951.9399999999999s)]
*  but it reminds me of what you had said earlier in our conversation about the tension between [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=958.3s)]
*  Kennedy and the CIA. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=964.58s)]
*  That would seem to fuel the idea that in this period there is a conflict between the spy [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=966.94s)]
*  agency and the president. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=974.1800000000001s)]
*  That's right, Michael. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  This is a piece of evidence about the tensions between the CIA and the Kennedy administration. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=977.46s)]
*  They did not like this idea of unchecked intelligence power, and that becomes the kernel of many [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=983.98s)]
*  conspiracy theories about why the CIA had it out for Kennedy. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=992.58s)]
*  From the beginning here, you can see the origins of this deep state idea that there is powers [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=998.34s)]
*  within the government that are operating without the regular checks and balances, without the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1005.0600000000001s)]
*  direct control, the direct knowledge of the president. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1011.0200000000001s)]
*  That makes any president nervous, and we can see that blossom generations later with President [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1014.98s)]
*  Trump. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1021.38s)]
*  What else do we learn from these unredacted documents about the CIA? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1023.18s)]
*  Well there's another document that was written for William Colby, who was the CIA director [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1026.9s)]
*  in the 1970s. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1032.14s)]
*  He asked an aide to look into activities the CIA was up to that, quote, exceeded the charter. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1034.14s)]
*  Just translate that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1042.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1043.62s)]
*  What he means there is the CIA is not supposed to operate in the United States. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1044.66s)]
*  There are specific guidelines in terms of what the CIA does overseas. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1051.26s)]
*  If the president doesn't directly authorize it, you're not supposed to do it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1055.02s)]
*  There's clearly a belief by some around Colby that the agency had gone too far. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1061.34s)]
*  This document again had come out before, but had redactions. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1069.74s)]
*  Now what we see is new material, again about spying on the French. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1073.34s)]
*  This time in the United States, we learned that the CIA not only was doing the eavesdropping, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1079.82s)]
*  but they actually broke into the French consulate building. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1085.7s)]
*  It is kind of an example of the CIA out of control. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1090.06s)]
*  Beyond that, in these documents, we have other examples of the CIA going beyond that charter. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1096.1s)]
*  We have them listening to the phones of journalists in Washington. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1103.74s)]
*  Now remember, we knew that before these documents came out, but now we know more. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1109.14s)]
*  We have another name of a Washington Post reporter we did not know whose phone was being [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1115.5s)]
*  tapped that the CIA was listening to. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1120.14s)]
*  What these removed redactions are really showing us is just a deeper version of what we had [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1123.74s)]
*  already understood, which is just how out of control the CIA was in this period, rather [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1130.7s)]
*  than these documents telling us anything really new or revelatory related to the conspiracy [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1138.62s)]
*  theories around Kennedy's death. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1144.86s)]
*  Yes, but it's also true that this additional information feeds other conspiracy theories [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1147.58s)]
*  that have developed over the years. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1156.02s)]
*  Take the eavesdropping on Washington journalists. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1158.74s)]
*  That was part of a real program the CIA called Project Mockingbird. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1163.48s)]
*  Right, you mentioned that before. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1168.16s)]
*  But Robert F. Kennedy Jr. often talks about something called Operation Mockingbird, which [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1170.1200000000001s)]
*  he says is an effort by the CIA to not just listen to journalists, but manipulate them, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1176.8s)]
*  control them. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1184.8s)]
*  So, he's taken a kernel of a real thing, this real abuse of listening to Washington [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1185.8s)]
*  journalists and morphed it into an entirely different conspiracy theory. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1192.2s)]
*  So in theory, a revelation like the one you just described of the CIA reaching into the [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1197.3600000000001s)]
*  phone lines of journalists in the 1960s could further fuel that unsubstantiated theory that [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1203.1200000000001s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. subscribes to, that the CIA is trying to control journalists. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1210.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1215.6000000000001s)]
*  And look, in the past, we've had releases of documents that have been meant to dispel [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1217.52s)]
*  conspiracy theories, to try and bring more rationality and logic and information into [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  the debate. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1233.4599999999998s)]
*  But now, maybe for the first time, we have people who are invested in the conspiracy [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1234.62s)]
*  theories, and they have a very different set of interests. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1241.8799999999999s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy is pushing this transparency in part because he believes there's new information [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1246.48s)]
*  about these conspiracy theories that he's pushed for years. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1254.6s)]
*  So, those putting out these docs now, they are not interested in dispelling them as their [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1257.88s)]
*  forefathers in disclosures like this have. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1264.1200000000001s)]
*  They're putting them up because they're believers in conspiracy theories. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1267.8s)]
*  Do you think it's fair to put President Trump in that category? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1270.68s)]
*  Not completely. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1274.8s)]
*  He may not believe every old conspiracy theory, but he definitely believes there's a conspiracy [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1275.92s)]
*  to get him today. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1281.3200000000002s)]
*  He definitely believes the deep state is out to undermine his presidency. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1282.8400000000001s)]
*  He blames them for the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1288.42s)]
*  He blames them for undermining his foreign policy. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1294.8400000000001s)]
*  So if something comes out that undermines the credibility of the intelligence agencies [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1299.16s)]
*  of the FBI, Trump does not oppose that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1304.8s)]
*  Well, that gets to a question that I think is going to be on a lot of people's minds [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1307.92s)]
*  as they get to this point in the conversation, which is, are all the revelations that we [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1312.6000000000001s)]
*  have just been discussing, especially around the CIA, in any way strengthening the one [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1316.72s)]
*  conspiracy theory that Trump subscribes to the most still about a deep state, or is the [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1321.96s)]
*  reality that what's in these documents is so old that it's quite irrelevant to today's [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1328.2s)]
*  debate over government and the deep state that Trump talks about. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1334.52s)]
*  Now, how should we think about that? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1337.8799999999999s)]
*  Objectively, I would say the old history has very little to do with how the CIA operates [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1340.24s)]
*  today. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1347.08s)]
*  There have been years of reform. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1348.52s)]
*  There's far more congressional oversight today than there was in the 1960s. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1350.44s)]
*  But that may be a minority view. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1355.76s)]
*  A lot of people, they look at these old stories and they see proof of what they think is happening [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1358.56s)]
*  today. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1364.32s)]
*  And so even if we know that the CIA operates very differently, people use evidence of past [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1365.56s)]
*  mistakes to argue that there is a deep state that today is undermining the president. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1374.36s)]
*  So in that sense, the foundational conspiracy theory that the intelligence community played [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1381.32s)]
*  a role in Kennedy's death, and that the government spends all this time releasing documents to [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1385.08s)]
*  dispel, ends up seeding newer, different conspiracy theories, all of which seems to tell us that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1391.74s)]
*  transparency or efforts at transparency when it comes to something like the Kennedy assassination, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1400.7s)]
*  it didn't really solve conspiracy theories. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1405.94s)]
*  It helped them, I think the word you used was blossom, which isn't necessarily the best [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1408.9s)]
*  case for transparency. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1413.54s)]
*  Does that mean we just have to accept that the more you release, the more conspiracy [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1414.54s)]
*  theories there will be? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1418.48s)]
*  That's just the reality of it? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1420.06s)]
*  That's a totally depressing thought. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1421.78s)]
*  I really hope it's not true, but I don't really know what the way to counter that is, but [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1424.4199999999998s)]
*  through more transparency and more objective looks at the information, more analysis that [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1433.46s)]
*  the full context that pushes back against conspiratorial thinking. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1443.46s)]
*  But conspiratorial thinking has been very sticky in America. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1450.86s)]
*  Go back to just the short time after the Kennedy assassination, only 30% of the people believed [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1456.1799999999998s)]
*  Oswald acted alone. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1464.5s)]
*  Almost 50% believed there was a conspiracy. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1468.48s)]
*  Now those numbers have fluctuated some after that JFK movie, only 10% of people believed [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1472.16s)]
*  Oswald acted alone. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1479.2s)]
*  But today, years later, after all these revelations, decades later, 60 years later, we're back [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1481.76s)]
*  where we started. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like 30% of people believed Oswald acted alone, 65% of people believe there was conspiracy [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1492.24s)]
*  to kill Kennedy. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1500.3000000000002s)]
*  Wow, kind of unchanged or even worse. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1501.74s)]
*  Yeah, this is not a case against transparency. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1504.74s)]
*  This is not an argument that we shouldn't be releasing this information. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1508.82s)]
*  But it's just a reminder about how powerful the idea of conspiracy is, how much of a hold [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1515.6799999999998s)]
*  that has on the American mindset. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1523.3799999999999s)]
*  And we can't think that another release of documents, another revelation is going to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1526.76s)]
*  dismiss those conspiracy theories. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1534.64s)]
*  It's just as likely that they'll give them new life. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1538.64s)]
*  Well, Julian, thank you very much. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1549.76s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1553.08s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1556.76s)]
*  And should be fired immediately if he's not man enough to own up to his mistakes. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1586.76s)]
*  On Wednesday, a growing number of congressional Democrats called on Defense Secretary Pete [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1593.3799999999999s)]
*  Hegseth to resign or be fired after it emerged that texts he inadvertently shared with a [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1598.1s)]
*  journalist over a commercial messaging platform contained detailed information about an upcoming [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1604.34s)]
*  US military attack. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1610.76s)]
*  The texts from Hegseth, which were released by the journalists who received them, cast [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1613.44s)]
*  doubt on claims by the officials involved in the text chain that nothing in their messages [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1618.2s)]
*  was classified. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1624.24s)]
*  Hegseth is doing a great job. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1625.24s)]
*  He had nothing to do with this. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1627.0800000000002s)]
*  Hegseth. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1629.1200000000001s)]
*  How do you bring Hegseth into it? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1630.1200000000001s)]
*  He had nothing to do. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1632.6000000000001s)]
*  Look, look, it's all a witch hunt. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1633.6000000000001s)]
*  Asked about Hegseth's future during a news conference at the White House, President Trump [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1636.44s)]
*  defended him and called the growing political furor over the texts another coordinated [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1640.88s)]
*  attack against his administration. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1647.16s)]
*  And President Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on all cars and certain car parts [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1650.16s)]
*  that are imported into the United States starting next week. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1658.2s)]
*  In doing so, Trump would make good on a promise long feared by automakers across the world. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1662.24s)]
*  The tariffs could encourage carmakers to open up more US factories, but will disrupt [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1670.0s)]
*  supply chains and most likely result in significantly higher car prices for American consumers. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czR8NCnVQo&t=1676.16s)]
