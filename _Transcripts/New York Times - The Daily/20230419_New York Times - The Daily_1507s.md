# Abortion Goes to the Supreme Court (Again)
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJwT5Zxqn6o)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  In overturning Roe v. Wade last year, the Supreme Court's message was that it was
*  done with the issue of abortion. It wasn't. Today, Adam Libtak, on the case that is forcing
*  the high court to weigh in on abortion all over again.
*  It's Wednesday, April 19th.
*  So Adam, here we are once again, you and me, talking about abortion and the Supreme Court.
*  Right. And I thought when we talked about the big decision in June in Dobbs overturning
*  Roe v. Wade, that the Supreme Court had kind of made us a promise that it was getting out
*  of the abortion business and that the fight over abortion would now be political, not
*  legal.
*  Right. And yet, this issue has already made its way back up to the Supreme Court. So tell
*  us why that has happened.
*  So opponents of abortion won, of course, an enormous victory last June. And the upshot
*  of that victory was that Roe v. Wade was overturned. And in much of the country, abortion became
*  illegal, but not in all of the country. And opponents of abortion wanted to be legal nowhere.
*  And they hit upon a strategy to go after the most common method of abortion in places where
*  it's still legal, which is the use of abortion pills, notably one called Mifepristone.
*  Right. A drug that, as we've explained on the show in the past, is used in about half
*  of all abortions in the U.S. But remind us how exactly these anti-abortion groups try
*  to go after this drug.
*  Well, some groups of doctors and individual doctors who oppose abortion go into federal
*  court in Amarillo, Texas. They do a bit of judge shopping. There's only one judge in
*  Amarillo, Texas, federal judge, Matthew Kazmeric. And they make the argument to him that the
*  Food and Drug Administration, 23 years ago, in 2000, had relied on bad science to approve
*  this drug and that the judge should step in and take the extraordinary step of suspending
*  the approval of this abortion bill.
*  Right. These groups want this medicine off the market entirely, and they think this is
*  the judge who's going to make that happen.
*  Right. And he holds a hearing, hears the arguments, and a little while later issues precisely
*  the decision opponents of abortion were hoping for, saying he would suspend the availability
*  of the drug. And his decision is widely criticized. Many people think it's flawed.
*  And why exactly?
*  Where to begin? There's a very significant question about whether these abortion opponents
*  had legal standing to sue, whether they themselves had suffered the sort of direct and concrete
*  injury that gives them standing to sue. Their claim is that some of them are emergency room
*  doctors, and some of them might someday be in an emergency room where the rare thing
*  of a complication induced by this abortion bill causes a woman to have to go to an emergency
*  room, and they will have to treat that woman, and they won't want to do that. And that chain
*  of causation, legal experts say, does not satisfy ordinary understandings of standing.
*  Because it's very theoretical rather than a case being brought by people who have actually
*  suffered the harm.
*  Right. And there are Supreme Court cases that say as much that even a statistically likely
*  prospect of future harm doesn't do it.
*  Okay, so a shaky start. What else about the decision is considered less than pristine?
*  There's a statute of limitations for challenges to drugs of six years. The drug was approved
*  in 2000, and I'm not great at math, but 23 is larger than six.
*  It is.
*  So there's a real statute of limitations problem. And then there's the largest problem of all,
*  a conceptual problem about who should be making the decisions about whether drugs are safe
*  and effective. We have on the one hand an expert agency, the Food and Drug Administration,
*  which has gone through extensive study and approved the drug. And on the other hand,
*  we have a federal judge in Texas who is reevaluating that evidence for himself, although as far
*  as I know, he has no particular scientific training. And he's also relying on some studies
*  that critics have real problems with, including collections of blog posts. So it does not
*  seem to be peer-reviewed science we're getting here. But nonetheless, Judge Matthew Kaczmarek
*  comes to the conclusion that the FDA was wrong in the year 2000 to approve this drug.
*  So in multiple meaningful ways, this Texas federal judge's ruling feels shaky, maybe
*  even a little bit shoddy. But here it is. He's a federal judge. His ruling has consequences.
*  So what happens next?
*  Well, the judge had some choices about what to do about his decision while the inevitable
*  appeals were going to happen. He could have put the decision on pause to give the litigants
*  and higher courts ample time in a deliberate way to consider whether his ruling was right
*  or not. Instead, he gives the world a seven-day deadline. His ruling is going to come into
*  effect in a week unless a higher court does something to stop it.
*  And that thing that will happen in just a week is that Memphis Pristone would be taken
*  off the market, a very serious, very significant change.
*  Yes, it would cause chaos in the marketplace.
*  And so what is the reaction to this very aggressive timetable from this Texas judge?
*  There's reaction all over the place.
*  This is a breathtaking example of judicial aggressiveness.
*  First of all, the decision itself is the subject of really harsh criticism from across the
*  ideological spectrum.
*  The ruling reads like somebody who is an anti-abortion activist.
*  I think there are problems with the judge's ruling, but I think that's because of his
*  religious beliefs. I think he simply made traditional errors.
*  There's a reaction from the pharmaceutical industry.
*  More than 600 drug makers and biotech leaders signing on to a scathing condemnation of that
*  ruling by a federal judge in Texas.
*  Which is terrifying not only about this abortion bill.
*  If one medicine is subject to this kind of outcome, really any medicine is.
*  But about the idea that judges all across America are going to be second-guessing the FDA's
*  approval of other drugs.
*  Doctors are once again scrambling at issue use of a key abortion medication after two
*  conflicting court opinions.
*  There is also on the same night that the Texas judge rules a ruling from a judge in Washington
*  state that goes in precisely the opposite direction and says that in 17 states and the
*  District of Columbia, the FDA may not suspend approval of the drug, must keep the drug in
*  place.
*  The two competing rulings set up a high stakes legal showdown that's likely to end up before
*  the U.S. Supreme Court.
*  So now there's contradictory rulings in the land.
*  The Biden administration immediately goes to an appeals court, the U.S. Court of Appeals
*  for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.
*  Today the Justice Department appealed a federal judge's ruling asking for an emergency stay.
*  And says, please stop that seven-day deadline.
*  Please let us litigate this in an orderly fashion.
*  And how does the Fifth Circuit respond?
*  So the question before the Fifth Circuit is what to do while the appeal goes forward.
*  And to the surprise of almost everybody, it issues a kind of mixed decision.
*  It says, we're not going to go back to 2000.
*  That's too far back.
*  The statute of limitations has passed.
*  We are going to maintain the FDA's approval of the drug and we're not going to recreate
*  the world of before 2000 where this drug was not yet approved as safe and effective.
*  But we are going to go back to 2016.
*  And in 2016 and in later years, the FDA gradually expanded access to the drug.
*  It made it available up through 10 weeks of pregnancy versus the original seven.
*  It required fewer visits to a doctor.
*  It allowed other healthcare professionals to prescribe it.
*  And it allowed the drug to be mailed.
*  All of that, the Fifth Circuit said, could be suspended.
*  So they didn't take the world back to 2000, but they took the world back to 2016.
*  So just to be sure I understand, whereas the Texas judge during this interim period wants
*  to roll back the clock on Mifflipirstone all the way back to 2000 to a world before the
*  FDA even approves this drug, the Fifth Circuit says, no, something more modest is in order.
*  We're going to roll back the clock to before 2016 when access to this drug was expanded.
*  So the world we're going to be living in right now is going to be one where Mifflipirstone
*  is available, but just not as available as it has been.
*  That's right.
*  And I suppose the Fifth Circuit thought that was a compromise of some sort, but not everyone agreed.
*  I'm curious, Adam, what do you make of the fact that we now in this legal saga have two
*  federal courts, one on the district level, the other on the appeals level, going outside
*  what in your description is the typical path of leaving access to a drug like this untouched
*  as a case winds its way through the system?
*  So let me start by saying that there's almost nothing typical about this case.
*  And this is the first time to anyone's knowledge that a court has overruled the FDA's approval
*  of any drug of any kind.
*  And not to be simple minded about it, but at least some legal observers note that the
*  Texas judge and the judges in the majority in the Fifth Circuit were all appointed by
*  Donald Trump, who had vowed to appoint judges who were prepared to overrule Roe v. Wade
*  and who were opposed to abortion.
*  Got it.
*  So against that backdrop, what, Adam, happens next?
*  Well, the Biden administration can't live with this supposed compromise from the Fifth
*  Circuit and it goes to the Supreme Court.
*  The Supreme Court that just last June said that it was getting out of the abortion business,
*  but that turned out to be wrong.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, what does the Supreme Court, which as you said doesn't really want to have to
*  be involved in this kind of a case, but now has had its hand forced, what does it do?
*  Well, Michael, remember that one week pause that the judge in Texas imposed?
*  Justice Samuel Alito says he's going to extend that pause just for a couple days to give
*  the Supreme Court enough time to read briefs, to get on top of the lower court decisions
*  and make a decision.
*  And he sets a new deadline tonight at midnight.
*  Got it.
*  So what exactly will we know by midnight tonight?
*  What is the scope of what we expect the Supreme Court to decide given all these conflicting
*  cases and this legal saga that has led us to this point?
*  So let me start by saying the Supreme Court can do whatever it likes, but I'll tell you
*  what the likely outcomes are.
*  One thing the court's not going to do tonight is decide on the merits of whether Judge Katt's
*  merit was right or wrong.
*  The court will almost certainly get to that question down the line, maybe months from
*  now.
*  For now, all the court is going to decide is what happens in the meantime while the
*  case goes forward.
*  And it can basically do one of three things.
*  One is to say that the status quo we've lived with for 23 years remains in place and the
*  appeal remains available.
*  The other is to say, as the Fifth Circuit did, that the relaxed standards after 2016
*  go away, but the pill is mostly available.
*  And the third is to say that while the case goes forward, access to the pill is suspended
*  and abortion becomes even more difficult to obtain in the United States.
*  Got it.
*  This is, of course, a Supreme Court whose conservative majority is inclined to oppose
*  abortion.
*  I don't think there's any debate about that.
*  But as you hinted at earlier, in its biggest ruling of all on abortion, made clear that
*  it wants elected officials to be deciding access to abortion rather than the judiciary
*  issuing a kind of one size fits all nationwide policy.
*  So which of these three outcomes that you just went through seems most consistent with
*  this Supreme Court's approach to abortion?
*  Well, if we take the court and its word in Dobbs, it claimed to be scrupulously neutral
*  about abortion.
*  It wasn't pro-abortion.
*  It wasn't anti-abortion.
*  It just said the Constitution has nothing to say about it and the court was going to stay
*  out of things.
*  If that vow is to be taken seriously, you would think the court would defer to the expert
*  agency in this area and its review of the science and certainly just while the case
*  proceeds allow access to the pill to continue.
*  So basically leave it as it was post-2016, full access to this pill, at least in the
*  states where abortion remains legal.
*  That's what the logic of Dobbs would suggest.
*  But of course, at least some of the justices may have been animated not by scrupulous neutrality
*  toward abortion, but by actual opposition to abortion.
*  So I might expect a split decision with the most conservative justices, justices Clarence
*  Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch may be off on one end.
*  The three liberal justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Katanji Brown-Jackson
*  off on the other end.
*  And then the middle of the court being decisive, Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Brett Kavanaugh,
*  and Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
*  And I think some coalition of the liberals plus the Chief Justice plus Justice Kavanaugh
*  might be enough to maintain for the time being the status quo allowing unfettered access
*  to the pill as we've had since 2000.
*  And let's presume, Adam, that your prediction here is correct.
*  And a coalition of liberal and conservative justices comes together and ensures unfettered
*  access to Mifflin Prestone for now.
*  What will that tell us about how the justices are likely to rule on this even larger and
*  more consequential question of whether this Texas judge's ruling has merit, that the FDA
*  was wrong when it approved this drug back in 2000 and that it should be banned?
*  So they're not the same questions.
*  They don't involve identical legal standards.
*  But nonetheless, as a practical matter, the vote on this initial question will be powerfully
*  predictive of the vote on the ultimate question, meaning that if I'm right, and we'll find
*  out soon enough, abortion opponents are likely in the short term but also in the long term
*  to suffer a setback.
*  But it's important to consider the context.
*  They want a huge victory on a constitutional question in the Dobs decision.
*  This is a different question.
*  Question of administrative law.
*  It was a very ambitious claim to begin with.
*  They found a sympathetic judge who produced a not particularly satisfying opinion.
*  And they can't have been all that confident that they could ultimately win on the merits
*  of this case.
*  And whatever the justices' sympathies are on abortion, they also have some commitment
*  to judicial craftsmanship and maintaining commitments to legal doctrines like standing
*  and the statute of limitations and how administrative law works.
*  And legal experts say that Judge Katsmerick's opinion flunked all of that.
*  And the Fifth Circuit's opinion was a little better.
*  So while people have lost a lot of faith in the Supreme Court, they still hope and expect
*  that a majority of the justices are committed to neutral legal principles that would make
*  this kind of case difficult to sustain.
*  So these two questions of what to do about Memphis-Pristone both in the short term and
*  the long term could ultimately reveal the limits of this Supreme Court's conservatism
*  when it comes to abortion.
*  There may be a place that it just won't go.
*  Yeah, I mean, there are outcomes that many of the justices might like.
*  But they need to have a pathway to those outcomes that looks like law, not politics.
*  And this doesn't look like that pathway?
*  No, it doesn't.
*  And while the court is full of surprises, this is a moment in time when it's in the
*  midst of a legitimacy crisis.
*  Its public approval ratings have plummeted.
*  There are almost daily revelations about apparent ethics violations, notably by Justice Clarence
*  Thomas.
*  And it's probably not the moment for them to endorse legal theories that all kinds of
*  serious people, conservatives and liberals both, think are borderline crazy and would
*  do more than affect abortions.
*  It would undermine the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to set national standards
*  for safe and effective drugs.
*  It would allow anybody with an objection to a vaccine or something else to go into court
*  and have a single federal district judge untrained in science to second-guess the approvals of
*  the expert agency.
*  So just as the FDA does a cost-benefit analysis of whether to approve a drug or not, the court
*  has to do a kind of cost-benefit analysis too.
*  It may like a particular result, but it has to think of the cost of the collateral consequences.
*  And the consequences here would be enormous.
*  Right, because the cost might not just be the court's legitimacy in the eyes of many
*  Americans because it would be endorsing what looks like an ideologically driven, legally
*  shaky ruling on a subject the court has said it doesn't want to touch anymore.
*  It could also imperil an enormous component of the American healthcare system.
*  And those are two costs that might make the justices inclined to show some real restraint
*  here.
*  Yeah, so this is a court that is assertive and ambitious and has an agenda.
*  And that agenda may even include trying to further restrict abortion, notwithstanding
*  what seemed to be a promise in the Dobbs decision.
*  But even so, you would think these are sensible, able judges who would want to pick their shots.
*  And maybe not in this particular case where there are the questions you've raised, Michael,
*  take an enormous step at the cost of imperiling its prestige, authority, legitimacy in an
*  era where it's under all kinds of scrutiny and assault.
*  Well, Adam, as always, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In a dramatic and surprise ending to what was expected to be a blockbuster defamation
*  trial, Fox News reached a nearly $800 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, which
*  had accused the network of knowingly spreading false claims about its role in election fraud
*  in the 2020 election.
*  The last minute settlement was announced after a jury had been selected and opening statements
*  from both sides were about to start.
*  Dominion had originally demanded $1.6 billion from Fox, but even with a settlement that
*  fell short of that, Dominion's lawyers called the outcome a major victory for the company
*  and the truth.
*  Today's settlement of $787,500,000 represents vindication and accountability.
*  Lies have consequences.
*  The truth does not know red or blue.
*  And on Tuesday, a Russian court rejected an effort by a Wall Street Journal reporter to
*  end his detention while he awaits trial on charges of espionage that both his employer
*  and the U.S. government say are entirely baseless.
*  The rejection came during a hearing in which the reporter, Evan Gurskiewicz, appeared in
*  public for the first time since his arrest.
*  His detention, the first time a Western journalist has been charged with espionage since the
*  Cold War, has brought relations between the United States and Russia to a new low.
*  Today's episode was produced by Nina Feldman and Alex Stern, with help from Michael Simon
*  Johnson.
