# The Diplomatic Scramble to Contain the Israel-Hamas War
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUhaAa_n3N4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  President Biden arrived in Israel today as the crisis in the region deepened.
*  We have other breaking news, NBC News now learning between 200 and 300 people were killed
*  in a bombing targeting a hospital.
*  These are people who were likely being treated for injuries related to the war already.
*  After a devastating blast at a hospital in Gaza, ignited protests across the broader
*  Middle East.
*  Palestinians in the West Bank, very agitated.
*  Yes, there's chaotic scenes outside the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, angry protesters, Lebanese
*  as well as Palestinians.
*  My colleague Edward Wong on America's most difficult diplomatic mission.
*  Anger is not just toward Israel.
*  People are blaming the U.S. administration.
*  Support its ally while also preventing a wider war.
*  It's Wednesday, October 18th.
*  So Ed, we have a deteriorating situation in the Middle East.
*  You've been very focused on American diplomacy in this moment and you've been traveling
*  with American officials all over the region for the past week.
*  Tell us what they've been trying to do.
*  Sabrina, this is the most intense diplomatic scramble I've seen among U.S. officials in
*  the time I've been covering foreign policy and diplomacy in Washington.
*  And it's obvious because the stakes are very high.
*  The U.S. wants to show full support for Israel, which is a very close partner in a region
*  where many countries have been hostile to it.
*  Then there's this growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza as Israel carries out its airstrikes
*  and prepares a ground invasion there.
*  And on top of all that, you've got the possibility of this becoming a wider regional conflict
*  and U.S. officials are desperately trying to head that off.
*  So from the very beginning of this crisis, American officials have been involved.
*  We saw the U.S. immediately come out and condemn the attacks by Hamas right after they took
*  place on October 7th on a Saturday.
*  And then over that weekend, there were a lot of intense discussions between President Biden
*  and foreign leaders in the region to really try and get them on board with a consistent
*  message about the attacks.
*  I know that the U.S. officials and U.S. leaders were intensely focused on showing strong and
*  unwavering American support for Israel at that time and for whatever Israel planned
*  to do, its military strikes, its retaliation against Hamas.
*  And they also wanted to speak with Arab leaders in order to try and persuade the leaders to
*  condemn Hamas and condemn the attacks and show as much support for Israel as they could.
*  And Ed, why was it so important to get Arab countries to sign on to this, to condemn the
*  attack?
*  Well, given the scale of the attacks, I think that the U.S. felt they had an opening to
*  try and get Arab nations and Arab leaders on board with what Israel is about to do.
*  As you know, Sabrina, the Palestinians are seen as victims by many Arab citizens across
*  the region.
*  I would say that the majority of people who live in the Middle East see Israel as an occupier
*  and see America as the backer of this occupation.
*  So even an attack like the Hamas attack will be seen as justified by many just ordinary
*  people in the region.
*  And I think that the U.S. was hoping that the governments and the leaders of the region
*  would help set the tone, will help guide public opinion by coming out and being more forceful
*  in their condemnation of these attacks.
*  So what happens?
*  Do any of them condemn Hamas in the attack?
*  Well, there are a couple Arab countries that do come out strongly against Hamas.
*  Over that weekend to Monday, we see the United Arab Emirates put out a statement that forcefully
*  says Hamas was not right in doing these attacks and naming Hamas.
*  And we also see Bahrain, a smaller country in the Gulf region, also put out a similar
*  statement and naming Hamas.
*  What's interesting is that these two countries had signed on a few years ago to what are
*  known as the Abraham Accords, which were these agreements that the Trump administration really
*  pushed in a diplomatic effort to try and get Arab countries to normalize relations with
*  Israel.
*  But Saudi Arabia, for example, makes a statement that essentially says, oh, we told you for
*  years that the Israeli occupation of Gaza would lead to reactions that you won't like.
*  Qatar, another Arab country, comes out with a statement that says Israel is solely responsible
*  for these attacks.
*  And that did not please U.S. officials at all, of course.
*  Okay, so the U.S. doesn't get much in this initial round of private calls, this initial
*  flurry of diplomacy.
*  What does it do next?
*  So on the Tuesday after the attacks...
*  Good afternoon.
*  You know, there are moments in this life, and I mean this literally, when the pure unadulterated
*  evil is unleashed.
*  President Biden comes out and gives what many people describe as one of the most emotional
*  speeches of his career.
*  Young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace, to celebrate
*  peace.
*  He forcibly condemns the attacks.
*  He describes in detail how horrific they are.
*  Families hid their fear for hours and hours desperately trying to keep their children
*  quiet to avoid drawing attention.
*  He evokes the history of persecution against Jews.
*  This attack has brought to the surface painful memories, scars left by a millennia of anti-Semitism
*  and genocide of the Jewish people.
*  He tells Americans, we stand with Israel.
*  We will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself.
*  And he described to the American people how he promised to the Israeli leader that the
*  United States would support Israel in whatever actions it takes.
*  These atrocities have been sickening.
*  We're with Israel.
*  Let's make no mistake.
*  Thank you.
*  And Sabrina, that same day, I was also getting a flurry of messages from the State Department
*  telling me to pack my bags because Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, was about to go on
*  one of the biggest diplomatic trips of his career.
*  So publicly, this overwhelming support for Israel in this moment by the U.S.
*  But at this point, Israel has also started bombing in Gaza, right?
*  So how is the U.S. viewing that?
*  And what's it saying to Israel about it, you know, either in public or behind the scenes?
*  Well, that's interesting, Sabrina, because this was something that I watched change as
*  I was following Tony Blinken around the region during this past week.
*  So when Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv, he put out a very strong message of unwavering and
*  unconditional support for Israel.
*  He stood next to Netanyahu and talked about how Israel had an obligation to defend itself
*  and that the U.S. completely understood what Israel was about to do in Gaza.
*  But as Blinken is traveling around the region and going to visit with Arab leaders in a
*  total of around a half dozen Arab countries in the area, he hears a lot of concerns about
*  the civilian casualties.
*  And so I think that this really impacted the thinking of U.S. officials.
*  And President Biden and Blinken were talking intensely during Blinken's trip.
*  And we saw Blinken as he stood next to Arab officials giving press conferences across
*  the region, talking more and more also about the need to address the suffering of the two
*  million people in Gaza.
*  And just to remind listeners here, Israel had shut off power, water and food to Gaza.
*  The bombing has been causing this deepening humanitarian crisis.
*  I'd imagine this was pretty worrisome to a lot of Arab leaders.
*  That's right, Sabrina.
*  They really are pushing for the U.S. to tell the Israelis, please back off from this cutoff
*  of water, this cutoff of electricity, this cutoff of food.
*  We're seeing all these images coming out of people fleeing the cities of the rubble and
*  bodies being pulled out of the rubble.
*  And I know that U.S. officials at this time were then really pressing the Israelis to
*  start restoring some of these basic services.
*  And were Israelis heeding what U.S. officials were telling them?
*  Were they doing that restoration of services?
*  Well Netanyahu and his top aides felt justified in using the most intense forms of warfare
*  against Gaza.
*  I think that the magnitude of the violence that Hamas carried out in Israel, these terrorist
*  attacks, really struck at the psyche of Israelis around the country.
*  You hear that when you talk with Israelis.
*  But they do start thinking about what the U.S. officials are telling them.
*  What about food and supplies?
*  Well Sabrina, there's only one land border crossing into Gaza and that's through Egypt.
*  It's a place called Ra'afah.
*  And so U.S. officials start negotiating with people from different governments.
*  So they talk to the Egyptians.
*  The Egyptians say they definitely want to make sure that A gets through that border.
*  Israelis are very reluctant to open it.
*  They have argued that over the years Hamas has gotten weapons through that border and
*  they don't want that border to be open as they're waging war on Hamas.
*  They've even done some airstrikes dropping bombs right around the border.
*  And so the Americans are talking to Israel to try and get them to hold back from doing
*  airstrikes or bombing on that border and trying to persuade them that getting humanitarian
*  aid to Gaza is a valid effort.
*  And we have to also remember that it's not Israel that controls that border.
*  Hamas does control that border.
*  And so the Americans are also trying to pass messages via officials in Qatar to Hamas to
*  try and tell Hamas we want to bring humanitarian aid through and please open the border when
*  the trucks start coming through.
*  Qatar is a country in the Gulf that has in the past passed messages to Hamas, had relations
*  with Hamas and is close.
*  Therefore that's how the U.S. is communicating with Hamas.
*  That's right.
*  Another important point about this border is that American officials have been trying
*  to get Palestinian Americans out of Gaza via this border crossing.
*  So they've been trying to talk to these countries to open up the crossing to American citizens
*  with valid documents.
*  And we know that other governments are also talking with Egypt, with Israel to try and
*  get the border crossing open for their citizens too.
*  So Blinken is working on getting Americans out and aid in.
*  But what about everybody else in Gaza?
*  I mean, there are two million people there.
*  Presumably some number of civilians there would leave if they could.
*  What about them?
*  Well, what we know is that Israel will do its offensive in northern Gaza.
*  They've been telling people in the north of Gaza to move down to the south.
*  There's a lot of people who want to get out of Gaza through the south, through this land
*  border.
*  But as American officials travel around the region and talk with Arab leaders, they're
*  discovering that the refugee issue is a very complicated one.
*  Arab nations are reluctant to take the refugees for various reasons.
*  They don't want a refugee crisis in their own borders, but they also don't think that
*  Israel should be forcing the relocation of Palestinians.
*  There are intense historical echoes of what happened decades ago to Palestinians.
*  And I was even hearing from Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who were outraged by
*  the fact that Israel was calling for people to move out of northern Gaza.
*  And also they were afraid that once Palestinians left Gaza entirely that they would not be
*  able to go back.
*  So there's a very complicated set of considerations here.
*  Okay, so the stakes are extremely high here, right?
*  I mean, two million Gazans, they have nowhere to go effectively.
*  There's a worsening humanitarian crisis.
*  Israel is attacking from the air and clearly preparing for a ground invasion.
*  Is the US exerting pressure on Israel at all to ease its approach or even to reverse its
*  plans to invade?
*  Well, what we're hearing from US officials is that they're still fully behind whatever
*  offensive Israel's planning in Gaza.
*  They know that Israel has been deeply wounded in physical and spiritual and psychological
*  ways by the Hamas attacks.
*  And also that Israel needs to show its adversaries around the region, namely other militias and
*  Iran, that it can protect itself.
*  And so the US feels strongly supportive of that.
*  And for example, we know that Pentagon officials are talking with Israeli officials about lessons
*  that the US has learned over decades of doing urban warfare and what fight in Gaza City
*  might entail.
*  But at the same time, we're also hearing lots of anxiety from American officials about the
*  prospects of a much wider regional war.
*  They think that once the ground invasion of Gaza starts and we see even bloodier images
*  that there will be massive concerns around the region and that other armed groups that
*  are supportive of Hamas will start taking part in the war.
*  And the US officials that I've been traveling with this week, one of their big pushes is
*  to really try and keep this war from becoming a huge regional conflict that could draw the
*  US in and put the US military squarely back in the Middle East again.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Ed, you said that the US officials you're talking to are very worried that this war
*  could turn into an even bigger conflict, one that spills out into the broader region.
*  Let's start to unpack that.
*  Well, Sabrina, we've been talking all this time about Hamas, which is this group that's
*  based in Gaza on the southern side of Israel.
*  But up in the north, Lebanon borders Israel, and there Israel faces attacks from a very
*  powerful militia, Hezbollah, that's based in south Lebanon.
*  And give us a primer on Hezbollah.
*  Remind us why it's such a threat to Israel and the US.
*  Well, Hezbollah has a very unique position in Lebanon.
*  There's a political wing that has seats in the government, and there's also a very powerful
*  military wing.
*  This military wing has many fighters who are well trained.
*  They have thousands of rockets, and they get a lot of backing from Iran, which is one of
*  the most powerful countries in the region.
*  In the 1980s, it carried out some of the most devastating terrorist attacks against US interests.
*  It carried out a bombing of the American embassy in Beirut in 1983, and it also carried
*  out another bombing, this one of Marine barracks in Lebanon.
*  The US has designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.
*  And Hezbollah has, similar to Hamas, made its mission to fight and destroy Israel.
*  That's right, Sabrina.
*  But Hezbollah is the much more powerful actor.
*  It's better funded, it's better organized, its fighters are better trained, and its weapons
*  systems are more powerful and more sophisticated.
*  So Hezbollah, a militia in Lebanon, is similar to Hamas in many ways, including being funded
*  by Iran, but it's also different because it's a more effective, more powerful fighting force.
*  And of course, it kept having wars with Israel, right, over that border into Israel's north.
*  I myself covered one of those wars in 2006, and it was extremely taxing for the Israeli
*  military, tied up their ground forces, took them weeks to extract themselves.
*  So it has been quite a force in Israel's north for many, many years.
*  But what about now with the attack on Israel last weekend?
*  We've seen an uptick in some of the exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah in the north.
*  So Hezbollah has been firing more rockets, and Israel has recently told its citizens
*  who are living up in those towns bordering Lebanon to start moving south.
*  Israel knows that things could heat up very quickly there.
*  Okay, so there's been rocket fire since the attack on Israel.
*  How has the United States been viewing that?
*  Well, U.S. officials are very anxious about this.
*  We're afraid that Hezbollah might decide to mount a full-on assault on Israel as Israel
*  carries out its war against Hamas in the south.
*  So the U.S. is watching this very carefully.
*  And to try and deter Hezbollah from doing anything, it has sent two aircraft carriers
*  to the region, one of them, the Gerald R. Ford, is already there, and the other one,
*  the Eisenhower, is moving there right now.
*  It's also sent a few thousand troops to the region, but it says that those troops for
*  now will not get involved in combat.
*  So the Americans are effectively reading the tea leaves of this bit of rocket fire that
*  started last week from the north, from Hezbollah.
*  They're worried about a wider war, and they're sending these ships to the region, presumably
*  to try to stop that from happening.
*  Right.
*  U.S. aircraft carriers are among the most powerful weapons in the U.S. military system.
*  And other countries know that.
*  So the U.S. is hoping that Hezbollah and its main backer, Iran, will read this and they'll
*  realize that if Hezbollah starts military assaults in northern Israel, that they will
*  incur a great cost.
*  And so they're hoping that there's a big deterrence factor to having these warships there.
*  But, you know, we all know that Israel is planning a huge ground invasion of Gaza.
*  And if it goes into Gaza with troops and do street by street fighting, it could get very
*  bloody and very violent there.
*  We'll see many civilian casualties probably even beyond what we're seeing with airstrikes
*  right now.
*  And then Hezbollah might feel obligated or they might feel the desire to open up a northern
*  frontier in Israel.
*  And many people who've looked at Israel's military say that military, even though it's
*  very well trained, is not powerful enough to fight a two front war.
*  And I think U.S. officials are also wary of another scenario, which is Iran getting directly
*  involved.
*  That's one of their biggest fears.
*  Their assessment right now is that Iran doesn't want to get involved in a regional war, but
*  a downward spiral of events could end up drawing Iran into a war.
*  They can't discount that possibility.
*  OK, so these are some of the calculations that U.S. policy makers are making.
*  And the big fear is that there will be a second front in Lebanon with Hezbollah or even that
*  Iran itself, Hezbollah's backer, would get involved.
*  What is the U.S. doing to try to head this off?
*  Well, that's where we're seeing a lot of urgent diplomacy taking place.
*  So I witnessed that this past week as I've been traveling around the region with Tony
*  Blinken and his aides, they're trying to communicate to Iran.
*  They're trying to get partner countries, even some of their rivals, to pass messages
*  on to Iran. So, for example, they've spoken about this with Qatar, which is a U.S.
*  partner, and they're telling Qatari officials to talk to one of their other partners, which
*  is Iran, that Iran should hold back.
*  And there was even one day during his travels here when Blinken decided to call Wang Yi,
*  China's top diplomat, because he wanted to try and tell China to persuade Iran to stay
*  out of the fight.
*  So, Ed, as we know, President Biden has made the choice to travel to Israel at this incredibly
*  sensitive moment. What do you think he's trying to accomplish with this visit?
*  Well, Biden is trying to do several things.
*  He wants to show full support for Israel for the war that it's waging.
*  He also wants to make sure that Israel and other governments in the region commit to
*  getting humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza.
*  That's becoming a much bigger crisis.
*  And he also wants to, again, send that message of deterrence to other adversaries of Israel
*  and say, I'm here, America's here.
*  And if you get involved in this war, then you'll feel America's wrath.
*  But of course, it's also a very fraught time for him to be going to Israel.
*  The airstrikes are intensifying in Gaza.
*  We're seeing many more images of civilians who've been killed in these strikes.
*  And just today, we got news that there was an explosion at a hospital in Gaza where
*  hundreds of people were killed.
*  And some of the images of the aftermath are absolutely horrific.
*  Hamas came out with a statement saying that this was the result of an Israeli airstrike.
*  And Israel has said that's not the case.
*  Fighters in Gaza might have fired an errant rocket that landed on the hospital.
*  Yeah, the videos circulating online do, as you say, show these unbelievably horrific
*  images. You know, clearly the details of what exactly happened there are still coming to
*  light. Israel has said it wasn't them.
*  But the images are out there circulating and make this an incredibly wrenching moment
*  for the Palestinians. And Biden's trip is set to place him in the middle of this, which
*  presumably makes his job of preventing the conflict from spreading harder.
*  It definitely ties Biden and America much closer to this war that Israel is waging, this
*  war that Israel feels is justified.
*  But it will evoke a strong reaction from Arabs across the region and even from some
*  governments that the U.S.
*  usually relies on to be its partners in the region.
*  So, Ed, I want to step back for a minute here.
*  You've just spent seven straight days traveling with American officials around the Middle
*  East. They're racing to contain the threat of wider war.
*  How do you see this moment based on what you're hearing from them?
*  Well, I think it's a very anxious moment.
*  I think it feels like we're in the edge of an abyss, potentially.
*  If this widens into regional war, it could be the biggest event in the Middle East in
*  many years, perhaps since the American invasion of Iraq and the Arab Spring and those
*  revolutions. And I think that the American officials are very, very worried about the
*  U.S. getting involved in another major war in the Middle East.
*  They know that our country has been scarred by these wars.
*  And some of the conversations that I've had with U.S.
*  officials as I've been traveling around with them have been among the bleakest I've had
*  since covering this diplomatic beat.
*  There is a very grim atmosphere.
*  They definitely know things could get much, much worse.
*  But also, these U.S.
*  officials tell me they need to stand strong with Israel.
*  They say Israel is a partner.
*  It's an ally and that America has promised to defend Israel through the decades
*  against its enemies.
*  Ed, we started this episode asking how the U.S.
*  was getting involved in this conflict and how it was trying to thread a needle, support
*  Israel, even if it goes down the road to ground invasion, while at the same time easing
*  the humanitarian crisis and containing the broader war.
*  In some ways, what we're seeing now, images from the hospital and the bombings of the
*  past week, is potentially just the beginning.
*  So you're talking to officials.
*  What price will U.S.
*  officials be willing to pay for the support of Israel?
*  Well, the officials tell me that their support and their resolve is steadfast.
*  But I think what's going to happen is we're going to see that tested many, many times
*  over the coming weeks and the coming months.
*  This is just the start of the war.
*  The Israelis say they're ready to fight a long war against Hamas and against any other
*  adversaries that get involved.
*  And in these areas, there are many, many civilians.
*  And I think that both the Americans and the Israelis are gritting their teeth and saying
*  we're going ahead.
*  But then the question is, as these images keep coming out and as public opinion starts
*  to turn more against Israel, how resolute will these American officials be?
*  Will they start to wonder whether they'll pay a political price, for example, for continued
*  support of Israel?
*  Will they decide they need to push back against some of Israel's military tactics in
*  the area? I think these are all questions that will become even greater in relevance
*  as this war goes on.
*  Ed, thank you.
*  Thanks, Sabrina.
*  On his diplomatic trip to the Middle East, President Biden had planned to visit Jordan,
*  where he would meet with Palestinian leaders.
*  But on Tuesday afternoon, that summit was abruptly canceled after the blast at the
*  hospital. The situation deteriorated throughout the evening with defiant crowds of
*  protesters clashing with security forces in Amman and in Beirut.
*  And in Iran, the country's foreign minister, who on Monday had warned that multiple
*  fronts would open against Israel if attacks against Palestinians continued, said that
*  time was up.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  The tellers agree in their tallies that the total number of votes cast is four hundred
*  thirty two, of which the Honorable Jim Jordan of the state of Ohio has received 200
*  votes. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ultra conservative Republican seeking
*  to become the speaker of the House, failed to win the job during a vote on Tuesday
*  when a determined block of moderate Republicans blocked his path.
*  No person having received a majority, the whole number of votes cast by surname, the
*  speaker has not been elected.
*  The chair declares the House in recess, subject to the call of the chair.
*  Jordan, an ally of Donald Trump, who led the congressional effort to overturn the
*  2020 election, fell 17 votes short of the majority he needed.
*  Not a single Democrat supported him.
*  And one of them, Representative Pete Aguilar of California, delivered an unusually sharp
*  rebuke of Jordan's record from the House floor.
*  A vote today to make the architect of a nationwide abortion ban, a vocal election
*  denier and an insurrection insider to the speaker of this House would be a terrible
*  message to the country and our allies.
*  Jordan plans to call for a second round of voting this morning, but it's unclear
*  whether he can win over enough skeptical Republicans to secure the speakership.
*  If he fails, the House will remain leaderless and paralyzed.
