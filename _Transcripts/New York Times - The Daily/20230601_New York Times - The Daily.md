# How the G.O.P. Picked Trans Kids as a Rallying Cry
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igYZ06-MUeY)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a Daily.
*  Today.
*  With stunning speed, the status of trans youth has become the rallying cry of the Republican
*  Party, from state legislatures to presidential campaigns.
*  My colleague Adam Nagourney has been reporting on precisely how that came to be and why it's
*  proving such a potent issue.
*  It's Thursday, June 1st.
*  Adam, over the past few months, it has felt like the Republican Party at every level has
*  made what very much looks like a concerted decision to focus its attention, its rhetoric,
*  and its political power on transgender identity and trans rights.
*  And you have been studying that strategy closely.
*  So put it into context for us, the scale of it.
*  You know, it's as big as you think it is.
*  We're seeing across the country that Republicans are talking about this.
*  Leading candidates for the 2024 presidential race are already releasing campaign ads.
*  It's morning again in America.
*  One of them being Donald Trump, who specifically mentioned trans people in sports.
*  Mediocre male athletes now given the opportunity to compete unfairly.
*  We've seen politicians at every level across the country, again, Republicans, using similar
*  language.
*  Girls are going to play girls sports and boys are going to play boys sports.
*  That's what we're doing.
*  That girls should be girls and boys should be boys.
*  The largest gathering of conservatives, CPAC, earlier this year was very much dominated
*  by this issue.
*  If transgenderism is false, as it is, then for the good of society and especially for
*  the good of the poor people who have fallen prey to this confusion, transgenderism must
*  be eradicated from public life entirely.
*  But it's more than rhetoric.
*  We're seeing actual legislation passing.
*  We've had a bunch of states over this past year that have passed laws that have restricted
*  the ability of minors to get access to healthcare or compete on sports teams.
*  So it's been really a big deal in my view.
*  And my sense is that it's just going to grow.
*  Well, Adam, to the degree that this really has been the year where this issue came to
*  a head and reached a critical mass and for Republicans has found real success, especially
*  in the form of legislation, we want to talk to you about how that came to be.
*  How did Republicans come to agree that this issue, kids who identify as trans, is the
*  issue that they would put so much money and muscle behind in this moment?
*  So tell us what you have come to understand about that.
*  It's partly organic.
*  It probably just kind of happened for a variety of reasons.
*  And it's partly part of a well organized effort to put this on the map.
*  I think it goes back to 2015 when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same sex marriage.
*  And that was obviously a big victory for gay rights groups that have been fighting for
*  that for a long time.
*  And we're, I would argue, kind of surprised that their legal and political success and
*  getting it through and getting such widespread acceptance to it.
*  Now there are a few things that are going on here.
*  What is it the most well funded mainstream gay rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign,
*  Lambda Legal Defense Fund, the Victory Fund, they've been around for a long time.
*  And in their history, they tended to be formed by overwhelmingly white, male, middle class
*  people, not exclusively, but predominantly.
*  And they don't represent the entire gay rights movement, certainly not the gay rights movement
*  that we see today.
*  But they're prominent and they have money and they have influence.
*  And the truth is, some of them have been uncomfortable with trans issues going back at least to Stonewall.
*  And I say that as someone who's actually studied this and actually wrote a book about this.
*  And just explain that, Adam.
*  Because we all understand this acronym LGBTQ, you're suggesting that there's something
*  of a complex inner dynamic between those letters, gay and trans.
*  There is a complex inner dynamic.
*  I don't think we should assume that some of these gay rights groups would automatically
*  move to trans issues.
*  At the same time, once that court made a decision, they were without an issue that they had used
*  to organize and to raise money and to rally support for years.
*  So they needed to kind of figure out what to do next.
*  And you could see this sort of trend toward embracing trans issues.
*  And it began around then.
*  Right.
*  I remember this moment really well, Adam.
*  I remember covering the legalization of gay marriage for the Times.
*  And it was something that was talked about somewhat openly, that with gay marriage passed,
*  the gay rights movement had achieved this major milestone in social acceptance.
*  And the feeling was that for these groups that you just described, the next natural
*  logical place to advocate was for trans people who did not win the same kind of rights during
*  that period that gay men and women had.
*  I think that's right.
*  And this became a really clear issue for these groups to rally around.
*  So yes, I think that's correct.
*  OK.
*  But what does that start to look like?
*  All of these organizations and infrastructure that had been focused on gay rights suddenly
*  turning their attention to trans rights.
*  So you start seeing the same organizations that had been lobbying for gay marriage turn
*  their attention to laws that would protect trans people.
*  History was made today when the Defense Department lifted one of the last bans on service in
*  the armed forces.
*  This is when the Pentagon lifts the ban on trans people serving openly in the military.
*  And they will be eligible for any medically necessary care, including surgery.
*  And big changes to driver's licenses and IDs in California and New York.
*  Some local governments start lifting the requirement that people choose a gender identification
*  when applying for a driver's license.
*  Oregon, Maine, Minnesota, Washington State, and Washington, D.C. already offer three gender
*  classifications.
*  And at the same time, we're seeing more changes culturally in society in terms of transgender
*  visibility.
*  Ladies, I want each and every one of you to go back to your bunks tonight and get to know
*  your own cha-cha.
*  OK?
*  So the show, Orange is the New Black, features a trans actress.
*  That is history being made.
*  Laverne Cox from Orange is the New Black is the first transgender person to make the
*  cover of Time.
*  And then, of course, in 2015, Bruce always had to tell a lie.
*  Caitlyn doesn't have any secrets.
*  Caitlyn Jenner was on the cover of Vanity Fair.
*  Soon as the Vanity Fair cover comes out, I'm free.
*  It was a real moment.
*  And you can be sure that those on the political right noticed the change.
*  In what way?
*  Well, I think they began at that moment to realize there might be a political issue here
*  where the American public in general was becoming supportive of same-sex marriage, but they certainly
*  were not supportive of some of these issues or at least familiar or comfortable with them.
*  This was new territory.
*  And, Michael, let me take a pause here.
*  I want to make an important distinction.
*  I think for some on the right, this was a matter of genuine concern.
*  But there were some where this was also a political decision or a calculated decision.
*  They saw this as a potent issue.
*  And they began to realize that this could replace gay marriage as something that could
*  help them organize, raise money, get attention, become relevant.
*  Both sides, after gay marriage is legalized, are moving on.
*  One to trans rights to champion it, the other to try to counter it and express awareness
*  of it.
*  I think that's right.
*  And I think that the same way the left saw there was something it could pivot to in terms
*  of gay rights issues, the right saw something that they could do to replace this big issue
*  they had lost.
*  OK.
*  So what does the right do about trans people and their sudden, much more visible emergence
*  in American life in this period?
*  So we all love to impose narratives on things that just sort of happen organically and isn't
*  quite that clean.
*  But what happens if you have a sort of constellation of conservative groups that have been working
*  on social causes over the years and up until this point that had been basically gay marriage
*  and abortion.
*  And there are groups like the Family Research Council, the Alliance Defending Freedom, the
*  American Principles Project.
*  An early attempt to turn this concern into action backfired and it backfired spectacularly.
*  How so?
*  So in North Carolina, legislators voted to bar transgender people from using public bathrooms
*  of their choice.
*  And it created a huge political and economic backlash.
*  And you had businesses like PayPal and Adidas pulling out, not investing in the state.
*  The NCAA and the NBA pulled back.
*  Performers like Bruce Springsteen canceled concerts and it culminated with the lawmakers
*  backing down and eventually rescinding the bill.
*  Right.
*  The reaction to that bill from businesses, from performers was outraged.
*  How could you do this?
*  And it became a kind of economic pressure on North Carolina.
*  I think I remember covering this.
*  That was so enormous that the lawmakers in North Carolina kind of scurried back to the
*  drawing board and said, oh, that was a mistake.
*  You're certainly right.
*  I guess the issue of bathrooms just wasn't resonating with the public, at least at the
*  time.
*  So some conservative strategists began looking around for other ways to frame transgender
*  rights as an issue that could be winning for the Republican Party.
*  OK.
*  And what happens in pursuit of that next trans battleground for Republicans?
*  So I should point out here that we have an interregnum.
*  Donald Trump is elected president at the end of 2016.
*  And you know, as president, he was definitely an early ally of this movement.
*  Right.
*  And he did stuff like rescind that Obama policy on transgender people serving in the military.
*  That turned out just to be the beginning for the Trump administration.
*  They moved on to narrow the definition of sex discrimination in education and in housing.
*  So transgender people are not considered a protected class.
*  Right.
*  So I think a lot of these groups felt kind of comfortable what was going on.
*  Nonetheless, they were still doing research.
*  And in 2019, these groups did polling.
*  They found that Republicans were more likely to support a Republican candidate who favored
*  a ban on transgender girls participating in sports than a candidate pushing for a ban
*  on transgender people using bathroom with their choosing.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  I think there was a power to the issue of fairness in sports and to the medical issue.
*  Like should trans teenagers, minors have access to what's known as gender affirming care?
*  What I mean by that is a range of treatments that can include mental health support, hormone
*  therapy, puberty blockers, and in rare cases, surgery.
*  So the polls were definitely part of what led them to shift from bathrooms to these
*  issues.
*  Both of those issues, we should point out Adam, involve not just any trans person, but
*  trans youth, trans youth in sports and trans youth seeking medical care for being trans.
*  Yeah, I think that's a big deal.
*  I think that these groups have been casting around for how to deal with this issue and
*  suddenly saw a clear path forward.
*  And in both these examples we both use, it involves kids.
*  Of course, it's around this time Adam, that more and more young people are starting to
*  identify as trans.
*  I mean the Times reported on it during this period, numbers are starting to emerge showing
*  that the trans community among young Americans is expanding.
*  Yeah, you know, that's right.
*  There was one study based on government data from 2017 to 2020 that estimated that 1.4%
*  of kids who were from 13 to 17 years old identified as transgender and 1.3 of 18 to 24 year olds.
*  Now 1% is not a big percentage, but the numbers are growing and I think the reason the numbers
*  are growing is because in some parts of the country it's more acceptable to come out as
*  transgender and care is more accessible.
*  And medical professionals will tell you that kids do need this kind of treatment at this
*  point in their life when there are a lot of changes going on in their bodies.
*  And it makes sense from that perspective to delay some of these changes until these minors
*  can come to terms with what exactly they want to do in terms of transition.
*  And we're not talking about many kids getting medical treatment.
*  The best numbers we have show that maybe 4,000 kids began hormone therapy in 2021.
*  But it was going on and it's caught the eye of conservatives and they're uncomfortable
*  with the idea of trans people in general and they're uncomfortable with the idea of kids transitioning.
*  So it made sense, you know, both for a policy perspective and from a political perspective
*  that Republicans seized on trans youth as an issue.
*  There's a history to framing these kind of issues around children.
*  Well, explain that. Adam, what do you mean?
*  This is nothing new. The idea of conservatives who oppose gay rights, speaking generally,
*  framing the issue around children has been going on at least since the 1970s.
*  Most famously is when a prominent singer actress named Anita Bryant in Florida.
*  Anita Bryant is not reluctant to use her show business background during her public appearances
*  on behalf of Save Our Children.
*  Led a campaign against gay rights by portraying gay men as predators of children.
*  Save our children. We do not want our children subjected to this kind of a role model.
*  And it was very effective.
*  I'm not talking necessarily of child molestation in the physical.
*  I'm talking about the psychological, which is even more detrimental.
*  Time and time again over these past decades,
*  particularly as we saw the gay rights movement shift to marriage.
*  Redefine a marriage would further distance marriage from the needs of children.
*  When conservatives trying to derail these efforts would raise questions about how children would
*  be raised by having same sex parents.
*  It would deny as a matter of policy the ideal that a child needs a mom and a dad.
*  And I think that's even more the case now with trans issues, particularly trans minor issues.
*  And conservatives understand that.
*  Right. You're saying this approach by conservatives of focusing on kids worked early on in fighting
*  gay rights. So it stands to reason that it would work against trans rights.
*  And if you're a conservative worried about trans rights, the reality is that the culture
*  and politics around trans people and trans rights are changing very quickly after 2015.
*  So that's how we arrive at this moment and this strategy by Republicans.
*  It's not coming out of nowhere.
*  It doesn't come from nowhere.
*  Really important point here is that these concerns are not only felt by conservatives,
*  they're also felt by some independent voters and even some Democratic voters.
*  All this stuff came together at once.
*  Conservative groups kind of stumbled into this.
*  They've been thinking about this for a long time and partly by planning and partly just
*  because stuff happens, they have stumbled across an issue that has real resonance and
*  they realize it.
*  And now the time has come to try to codify it in state legislatures across the country.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, Adam, you've explained how by 2019, a group of conservative activists have found
*  their issue and their strategy, which is to focus on trans kids.
*  So how did they begin to deploy that strategy across the country?
*  What do they do?
*  Well, before they can even get going, two things happened that really changed the
*  political atmosphere in the country and made it, I think, more amenable to their message.
*  The first, of course, was the pandemic and that created skepticism about medicine,
*  about medical professionals.
*  So when organizations like the American Medical Association or the American Academy of
*  Pediatrics say they support gender-affirming care for trans minors, there are a lot of
*  people who just discount that or just don't believe them or just trust them.
*  The kind of organizations that would have had a lot of credibility 20 years ago just
*  don't in this new world.
*  And then, of course, at the end of 2020, Donald Trump loses the election.
*  And what that means is that there's not anyone in the White House anymore who's going to
*  carry out this agenda on a federal level.
*  And they're forced to turn to the state legislatures.
*  Where, of course, they start turning this approach we've been discussing into actual
*  law.
*  So remind us exactly what these bills try to do and in which states they pass.
*  So we begin seeing these bills popping up all over the country.
*  And it's hard not to notice that they are often similar in language.
*  And that's because some of them are being drafted off of model legislation that was
*  put together by some of these conservative groups that have been leading the battle
*  against transgender rights for a while.
*  And once they help state lawmakers write these bills, they lobby to get it passed.
*  This week, Arkansas lawmakers passed a first-in-the-nation bill.
*  In early 2021, Arkansas became the first state to ban gender-affirming care for minors.
*  New tonight, Arizona's transgender youth have become a target at the state Capitol this
*  year.
*  And that was followed by Arizona and Alabama.
*  The law would make providing that care a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
*  And as of this taping,
*  Governors in Utah and South Dakota signed legislation banning gender-affirming care
*  into law.
*  Georgia and Iowa have become the latest states to enact anti-trans laws.
*  The most high-profile new state added to the list is Florida.
*  Over a dozen states have restricted access to medical care for minors, up from just three
*  in January.
*  More than 426 bills that have been described as anti-LGBTQ laws have been introduced in
*  state legislatures across the U.S.
*  And some of these bills go even further.
*  A record number of bills relating to health care, access to bathrooms, even drag performances
*  have already been tabled this year in state legislatures.
*  So it's been a big change.
*  And talk to us for just a moment about the practical impact of all these new laws.
*  Because at this time, we're now talking about at least 16 states with restrictions or bans
*  on gender-affirming care for minors, and more than 20 states that have some kind of a sports ban.
*  I mean, I think what it means is that any minor who identifies as transgender or is
*  searching to determine their gender identity and lives in a state where this is actively
*  discouraged, it's going to find life as difficult.
*  I mean, it's going to be harder to seek help.
*  It's going to be harder to join sports teams.
*  It's going to be harder to get hormone therapy or other gender-affirming care.
*  And in some states, some kids who are already getting these treatments are going to be forced
*  to stop.
*  It's just making it more difficult for them to live the way they want to live.
*  And activists say they put trans kids at serious risk.
*  Adam, as all this has been happening, what is the LGBTQ rights movement that was
*  so successful in the past doing to try to fend off these laws?
*  I mean, reality is that they cannot do much legislatively to change this.
*  These states are controlled by Republicans, legislators, and governors.
*  The sentiment is really strong.
*  There's just not much you can do to change the laws in the legislature.
*  But you can go to court.
*  And some of these groups are taking these laws to court with mixed success trying to
*  at least slow them down.
*  And advocates are doing what they can in the blue states to protect and bolster trans rights.
*  The result is that we're having two very different countries here.
*  It's very different to be a trans person living in a red state than a trans person
*  living in a blue state.
*  Adam, we started this conversation in 2015 and with gay rights and the success of gay
*  marriage.
*  A big way that gay rights activists overcame fear and antipathy of gay rights was by focusing on
*  adults and a very traditional request, the right of gay adults to be married.
*  And that ultimately is seen as having melted the opposition to gay rights.
*  I wonder how much the trans rights world thinks about that as a model.
*  And about the idea that they're likely to keep suffering political and legislative setbacks
*  if this debate is being framed as it now is by Republicans around kids and young people.
*  Yeah, I mean, history shows and social conservatives know that focusing on kids is an
*  effective and powerful way to frame this argument and ultimately to win this argument.
*  Now, if these policies start to encroach on the rights of trans adults, and I have to point out
*  in some places they already have begun, then social conservatives might lose support.
*  Certainly, I would argue among independent or moderate voters.
*  But for now, the vast majority of laws remain focused squarely on kids under 18.
*  Right.
*  And so long as that remains the case, it's going to present a real challenge for trans rights
*  advocates.
*  That's correct. I mean, it's a conundrum for them, right? For trans advocates, it's a huge issue.
*  You can't really turn away from kids because part of what we're talking about here is being a kid
*  and growing up as a potentially transgender kid. And they want to protect kids at this stage of
*  their life when they're undergoing puberty and their identities are beginning to emerge.
*  And how do they get out of that dilemma?
*  That's the situation we're in right now. And my gut is that this debate is going to be centered
*  on trans kids for a long time to come.
*  Adam, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael. I appreciate it.
*  It's wrong for a teacher to tell a student that they may have been born in the wrong body or that
*  their gender is a choice.
*  On Wednesday, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida began his newly announced presidential
*  campaign in Iowa by talking about trans kids and his efforts to keep any discussion of them
*  out of public schools.
*  We actually just signed legislation protecting students from having teachers force them to pick
*  pronouns, which they are doing in some parts of this country at very, very young age.
*  We're not competing in the pronouns sweepstakes. We're going to have school just like school.
*  The issue is expected to be central to DeSantis candidacy and to the larger battle for who becomes
*  the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to knitter day.
*  Yeas are 314, the nays are 117. The bill is passed.
*  On Wednesday night, the Republican controlled House passed a controversial plan to raise the
*  debt ceiling and avoid a U.S. financial default.
*  But in an embarrassing political setback for Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy,
*  who brokered the deal with President Biden, 71 House Republicans voted against it,
*  saying it failed to reduce federal spending by enough.
*  As a result, it fell to Democrats to push the Republican bill over the line.
*  In the end, more than 165 Democrats voted for the plan compared with just 149 Republicans,
*  a fact that House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was eager to highlight.
*  Extreme mega Republicans attempted to take control of the House floor.
*  Democrats took it back for the American people.
*  The bill now heads to the Senate, where Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer
*  said it will be adopted before June 5th, when the U.S. is expected to hit the debt ceiling
*  and run out of money.
