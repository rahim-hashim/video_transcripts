# Understanding Ukraineâ€™s Counteroffensive
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSIcIxiXKsc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Katrin Benhold, in for Sabrina Tavernisi.
*  This is The Daily.
*  For months, much of the world has been watching and waiting as Ukraine prepares for a major
*  counteroffensive in its war with Russia.
*  That battle is now underway, and it's not what we expected.
*  Today, my colleague Andrew Kramer reports from the front line.
*  It's Friday, June 23rd.
*  Andrew, you're 20 miles from very intense fighting after visiting the front line yourself
*  last week.
*  Thank you so much for making time for us.
*  Thank you for having me on.
*  So there's been a lot of hype around this counteroffensive.
*  When we last talked about it on the show, very little was actually known about it or
*  the timing of it.
*  But in the last couple of weeks, that has began to change.
*  Can you walk us up to this moment where we're just starting to understand what we actually
*  mean when we say counteroffensive?
*  The war in Ukraine had settled into a stalemate since last fall.
*  The armies were lined up against one another along about 600 miles of trench fortifications
*  in southeastern Ukraine.
*  And it was very intense and very violent fighting, but very little ground changed hands.
*  The war had become a quagmire.
*  So there was a lot of pressure on the Ukrainian government to show that the policies of arming
*  and assisting Ukraine were going to yield results.
*  So as this anticipation and hype arose about a counteroffensive, about a shift in the battlefield,
*  this had been building for months through the winter and into the spring.
*  But there was very little information about what would actually happen.
*  What were they actually saying, officially, publicly, the Ukrainians about this coming
*  counteroffensive?
*  Well, interestingly, they were saying almost nothing.
*  Just before the counteroffensive began, the government released a video that had the sounds
*  of crickets in the background and soldiers who were holding their fingers to their lips
*  and shushing, asking for silence.
*  And the video had a headline that said, Plans Love Silence.
*  Right.
*  It's a very quiet ad, almost too quiet to hear on a podcast.
*  And I guess that's the whole point, to signal to the world this counteroffensive is shrouded
*  in secrecy.
*  That's right.
*  Even with such secrecy that portions of the front line were closed to journalists.
*  The government was pleading with reporters, with society at large, not to reveal secrets
*  about where the military would gather forces, where the first blows would land on the Russian
*  line.
*  And in fact, when it began three weeks ago, the information about this was so carefully
*  guarded that the first we heard about it was from Russian military bloggers who were saying
*  that the Ukrainian counteroffensive had begun.
*  Only several days later, the Ukrainian government acknowledged that the initial attacks had
*  in fact commenced and that the Ukrainian army was on the move in several locations in southern
*  Ukraine.
*  So at that point, did you get a sense of what the strategy was here?
*  What the Ukrainian government's plan actually was?
*  It started to come into focus when we look at a map of the south of Ukraine and we see
*  where the military was attacking.
*  They were hitting at areas of the front line that face south toward the Sea of Azov.
*  The Ukrainian strategy in the counteroffensive is to strike south and drive a wedge through
*  Russian occupied territory, dividing the Russian zone into two halves and cutting rail and
*  road lines that connect Russia with the Crimean peninsula.
*  The idea of this strategy is a theory of victory that would cut logistical supplies to the
*  Crimean peninsula and also to everything west of where they drive this wedge through
*  the Russian territory, which would probably force a retreat of Russian forces to the west
*  of the counteroffensive.
*  It's a theory of a step toward victory that involves crossing about 60 miles of very flat
*  terrain from where the front line had been three weeks ago to the Sea of Azov.
*  So it's kind of like a version of divide and conquer as far as the Russian occupied territory
*  is concerned, but what do the Ukrainians actually have to face to complete this strategy?
*  What essentially lies in front of them?
*  Well what lies in front of them are farm fields as far as the eye can see, very flat open
*  terrain, militarily extremely difficult to cross, almost impossible to find cover for
*  armored vehicles or for troops in the open.
*  And the most difficult part is the first part.
*  The Russians have had months to prepare a very dense defensive line, which is about
*  10 miles deep.
*  And this is minefields, concrete barriers for tanks, ditches that would trap armored
*  vehicles, bunkers and trench lines for infantry.
*  And this is really a kill zone the Russians have set up for the Ukrainian army that is
*  really intended to inflict as much damage on the Ukrainian army as possible.
*  So the first goal is to breach this 10-mile strip of Russian defenses, this kill zone.
*  What's the tactical plan to breach that?
*  Well in each location it's a little bit different.
*  And one commander I spoke with compared this to a game of chess where out on these open
*  fields, there's sort of a checkerboard, tree lines and fields, and both sides can see almost
*  everything that the enemy is doing with their drones, with satellites, with surveillance
*  by soldiers on the ground.
*  So the strategy is to find areas that might be a little bit weaker than elsewhere.
*  In one location, for example, the Ukrainians attacked along a small meandering river, the
*  Mokri-Yali River, where there are six or seven villages all in a line.
*  And by hopping from village to village, the Ukrainians could find cover in abandoned houses
*  and move their equipment and their infantry forward into this area.
*  So it's like they're trying to push through this Russian defense line.
*  It's almost like they're pushing against a wall, trying with their hands in different
*  places and identifying the weakest spot.
*  Exactly.
*  That's what's happening now.
*  They're probing, they're looking for a weakness in the Russian defensive line.
*  And right now they're doing this with only a small portion of the soldiers who have been
*  specifically trained and equipped for the counteroffensive.
*  Only three of 12 brigades that will eventually take part in this military action are now
*  probing and fighting along the front line.
*  And presumably when a weak spot is found, those who are in reserve will come rushing
*  forward in a major battle to break through the Russian defenses and then flow into southern
*  Ukraine and advance toward the sea.
*  And it looks like it will be a very difficult and grueling battle once all 40,000 Ukrainian
*  soldiers are engaged in the fight.
*  At that point, it could be the largest land battle in Europe since World War II.
*  Wow.
*  So how is that pushing and probing on that Russian wall going?
*  It's going very slowly.
*  Even President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has acknowledged that it's going slower than desired.
*  In some areas now, they've moved about four miles into the zone and that's where the
*  fighting is taking place now.
*  It's been a very difficult fight.
*  It's a lethally dangerous.
*  One of the biggest challenges in this area are minefields.
*  There have been many Ukrainian soldiers who've stepped on mines.
*  According to medics, there are casualties coming out from these minefields and also
*  Western equipment that's blowing up on the minefields.
*  It strikes me that this feels almost reminiscent of past European wars.
*  We've heard so much about this advanced Western weaponry that the Ukrainians have asked for
*  and received, but this sounds almost like a 19th century land war.
*  Well, it certainly looks that way when you're out along the front line.
*  One of the reasons is that neither side has air superiority.
*  The Russians can fly right up to the front line and the Ukrainians can as well, but neither
*  side can really use fighter aircraft or helicopters to fly over the minefields, over the trenches
*  and attack the enemy.
*  In this sense, it's definitely a fallback to mid-20th century land warfare in Europe.
*  So this sounds like it's the real slog.
*  It's going very slowly.
*  And Andrew, you've been spending time on this front line with some of the soldiers.
*  What's your sense of what morale is like at this point?
*  It was my sense that some of these soldiers at least, or many of them, were quite motivated.
*  And not least because soldiers who are fighting in this offensive are internally displaced
*  people who've been pushed out of their home villages and towns in southern Ukraine and
*  are now fighting to liberate them.
*  I met with some soldiers at a picnic table a few miles back from the front line out in
*  a field where they were resting and talked about how the fight was going and what their
*  motivations were.
*  And this is what I was told, that they were very intent on reclaiming this land.
*  And the military, though it had initially been very secretive about its plans, about
*  two weeks into the fighting, there was a shift and they started to open up access.
*  And I was able to go into one of these liberated villages and see what it actually looked like firsthand.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Andrew, take us to that Ukrainian village you visited that had just been liberated.
*  Tell us about that trip.
*  It began on the Ukrainian side of the former front line.
*  The photographer, David Gutenfelder and I, got in an American armored vehicle, an MRAP,
*  a very large, bulky truck with lots of armor.
*  It takes about 10 or 15 minutes to drive from the front line into one of these liberated
*  villages, the village of Avakadatne.
*  You zigzag across swampy fields around a blown up bridge.
*  The vehicle at times accelerates.
*  It's a little bit hard to see what's going on outside the windows.
*  You just see some destroyed houses going by.
*  And these vehicles, these MRAPs, which the Ukrainians used to drive in and out of some
*  of the liberated areas, are very large and easy targets.
*  So when we arrived, the back door opened and we had to immediately run out and run away
*  from the vehicle and into the village.
*  So suddenly you're in the middle of the fight.
*  And after you emerge from that vehicle and get to safety, what do you see?
*  What are your first impressions of that town?
*  Well, it was overgrown.
*  I can see that many of the fruit trees in the yards had limbs blown off from shelling.
*  And every house that we passed had some sort of damage.
*  Either it was burned or the roof had been blown to pieces from artillery.
*  So it was an abandoned place, very eerie.
*  Either quiet or with the sounds of explosions.
*  It wasn't what you would expect of perhaps a liberated territory where people would be
*  greeting the soldiers or there would be some happy moments for the Ukrainian forces that
*  had entered this area.
*  It was very, very, very tense and very dangerous.
*  So it was sort of liberated in name, but ultimately the atmosphere was different.
*  It was ultimately a destroyed village, a village in rubble.
*  That's right.
*  It was completely destroyed and abandoned.
*  Where we were in Blokodatne on the southwestern side of the village, there was an open field
*  and then some reedy swamps and the river.
*  That was essentially the new front line was some several hundred yards in that direction
*  on the edge of town.
*  Some of the detritus of Russian positions were seen.
*  You could see trenches.
*  The Ukrainians had captured some machine guns, trophy weapons from the Russian forces that
*  had been just pushed out of that village recently.
*  You would see garbage the Russians had left behind and some of their personal belongings,
*  such as wrappings for Russian military rations.
*  I found a pornographic book called The Machine of Love left by a Russian soldier and there
*  was graffiti scrawled into the walls of the houses.
*  I saw one was a Russian Orthodox prayer.
*  There were also nicknames of soldiers and dates and the numbers of their units when
*  they had been there.
*  It's an interesting artifact, a little bit of the spirit of the Russian troops that had
*  recently left lingered in this graffiti.
*  We've seen this in many areas that have been liberated by the Ukrainians.
*  It's very angry.
*  It's taunting Ukrainians, its threats against them.
*  But there are also sometimes apologetic notes.
*  Some Russian soldiers have written on walls, I'm sorry or I don't understand what I'm doing here.
*  That's wild.
*  It kind of reminds me of something that the Russians did when they marched into Berlin
*  and liberated Berlin at the end of World War II.
*  You can still see the graffiti of these Russian soldiers at the time in the German parliament
*  today when you take a tour.
*  That's right.
*  This was a bit fresher.
*  There wasn't much time to linger and look at these details because the village was in
*  the sights of Russian artillery and it was very much still in the fight.
*  This is what the soldiers had confronted when they came into the village.
*  Did you get a chance to talk to any of these troops?
*  Did they tell you what it had been like to retake this village, what the battle had felt
*  like, how long it went on for?
*  I did.
*  I talked to one of the commanders with a Ukrainian unit who had come in with the assault troops
*  and retaken the village and then was based there while trying to stabilize this part
*  of the front line.
*  Who?
*  Who was on the train?
*  He was speaking in a darkened room where he was on his walkie-talkie dealing with various
*  situations including while we were there one of the MRAP armored vehicles was destroyed
*  by a grenade dropped from a Russian drone.
*  Soldiers, soldiers, get ready to move.
*  Kira, Kira, the machine gunner, get ready to move.
*  He was in between dealing with these small crises which were coming up minute to minute.
*  He was saying that this was an existential fight for Ukrainians, that he felt that he
*  had lived his life in a worthwhile way for being involved in this combat and recapturing
*  the village.
*  And also that when he came in and saw these gardens and his village homes that he had
*  that they were certainly Ukrainian.
*  He saw his own culture, Ukrainian culture in this agrarian village in eastern Ukraine
*  although he was from the western part of the country.
*  We asked the commander how he thought the war would end and he said it was going to
*  be a very difficult fight, that the Russians were dug in, they had lots of time to prepare
*  and lots of ammunition, but that ultimately the Ukrainian army would continue to advance.
*  He thought the war would still be going on by the end of this year.
*  But in the end that the Ukrainians would prevail in pushing Russian forces out of Ukraine.
*  And then he said that God would punish the Russians and the Ukrainian army would do the
*  same.
*  And in a way it's worth stopping for a moment and remembering that Ukraine is fighting the
*  Russian army and at the very least for the moment they're not losing.
*  That's right, what you see in this village is the Ukrainians now moving forward, now
*  on the offensive against the army that had been considered the second most powerful army
*  in the world.
*  And now it's stepping back even if in small ways, but stepping back in front of a Ukrainian
*  attack that the hope is, in Kiev at least, that this will continue through the summer
*  and they will be able to push the Russians back into the sea.
*  And this was one thing that the soldiers I talked to both in this village and elsewhere
*  were joking, the next time I'll see you, I'll see you on the beach.
*  But this was just one village.
*  To advance to the Sea of Azov, they'll need to capture dozens or hundreds of villages
*  like this.
*  They'll need many small victories like this.
*  And I couldn't help thinking what was in front of them.
*  And it was not a joyous moment because on the one hand they had reclaimed the village.
*  On the other hand, this had just turned them into a target for Russian artillery and Russian
*  attack helicopters.
*  So it was almost a metaphor for the counteroffensive, that every step forward would become one step
*  toward a more difficult task ahead for the Ukrainian army.
*  So in a way, what you're seeing there in this tiny village on the Ukrainian front line sums
*  up the paradox of this moment, that Ukraine is putting up an incredible fight, but that
*  every gain is excruciating and incremental.
*  And that if we thought this counteroffensive was going to be this fast and furious blitzkrieg,
*  we were wrong.
*  Well, that's exactly right.
*  When President Zelensky was talking recently about the counteroffensive, he said this would
*  be a slow fight.
*  And then he went even further than that.
*  He said that it's not going to be a Hollywood movie.
*  It's not going to follow a script that would be pleasing for people who are watching this.
*  It would be very difficult.
*  There will be lots of casualties.
*  And he said that a good portion of the Western weaponry, this billions of dollars of armored
*  vehicles and air defense systems and howitzers that have been given to the Ukrainian army
*  will be destroyed just moving through these first miles.
*  And he said that what's at stake here is the lives of his soldiers.
*  Andrew, thank you.
*  Thank you for having me on.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  This morning, an ROV, a remote operated vehicle, from the vessel Horizon Arctic discovered
*  the tail cone of the Titan submersible approximately 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic on
*  the seafloor.
*  In a news conference on Thursday, the United States Coast Guard said it had found debris
*  of the deep sea submersible that went missing on Sunday and that all five people aboard
*  are believed to be dead.
*  On behalf of the United States Coast Guard and the entire unified command, I offer my
*  deepest condolences to the families.
*  I can only imagine what this has been like for them.
*  Coast Guard officials said it appeared that the vessel, whose safety had been repeatedly
*  questioned by many experts, had imploded during the expedition.
*  When asked whether the bodies of the victims could be recovered, the Coast Guard said it
*  was unlikely.
*  This is an incredibly unforgiving environment down there on the seafloor.
