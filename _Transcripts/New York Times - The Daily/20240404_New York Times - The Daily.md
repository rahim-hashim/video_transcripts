# Israel’s Deadly Airstrike on the World Central Kitchen
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgJso1ci8gY)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barrow. This is The Daily.
*  The Israeli airstrike that killed seven aid workers delivering food in Gaza has touched
*  off outrage and condemnations from across the world.
*  Today, Kim Severson on the pioneering relief crew at the center of the story and Adam Raskoff
*  on what we're learning about the deadly attack on the group's workers.
*  It's Thursday, April 4th.
*  Kim, can you tell us about the World Central Kitchen?
*  World Central Kitchen started as a little idea in Chef José Andrés' head.
*  He was in Haiti with some other folks trying to do earthquake relief in 2010.
*  And his idea at that point was to teach Haitians to cook and to use solar stoves and ways for
*  people to feed themselves because the infrastructure was gone.
*  And he was cooking with some Haitians in one of the camps and they were showing him how
*  to cook beans the Haitian way.
*  You sort of smash them and make them a little creamy.
*  And it occurred to him that there was something so comforting for those folks to eat food
*  that was from their culture that tasted good to them.
*  You know, if you're having a really hard time, what makes you feel good is comfort food,
*  right?
*  And warm, comfort food.
*  Right.
*  So that moment in the camp really was the seed of this idea.
*  It planted this notion in José Andrés' mind.
*  And that notion eventually became World Central Kitchen.
*  And for those who don't know, Kim, who exactly is Chef José Andrés?
*  José Andrés is a Spanish chef who cooked under some of the Spanish molecular gastronomy
*  grates, came to America, really made his bones in Washington, D.C. with some avant-garde
*  food, but also started to expand and cook tapas, cook Mexican food.
*  He's got about 40 restaurants now.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, he's got a great Spanish restaurant in New York.
*  He's got restaurants in D.C., restaurants in Miami.
*  Come with me to the kitchen.
*  Don't be shy.
*  He's also become a big TV personality.
*  Chef, are you going to put the lobster in the pot with the potatoes?
*  We're going to leave the potatoes in.
*  Leave the potatoes in.
*  I love you here.
*  He's one of the most charismatic people I've ever been around in the food world.
*  He's very much the touchstone of what people want their celebrity chefs to be.
*  So how does he go from being all those things you just described to being on the ground
*  making local comfort food for Haitians?
*  And how does this all go from an idea that that would be a good idea to this much bigger
*  full-fledged humanitarian organization?
*  So he started to realize that giving people food in disaster zones was a thing that was
*  really powerful.
*  He helped feed people after Hurricane Sandy, and he realized that he could get local chefs
*  who all wanted to help and somehow harness that power.
*  But the idea really became set when he went to Houston in 2017 to help after Hurricane
*  Harvey.
*  And that's when he saw that getting local chefs to tap into their resources, borrowing
*  kitchens, using ingredients that chefs might have had on hand or, you know, are spoiling
*  in the fridge because the power's out and all these restaurants needed something to
*  do with all this food before it rotted.
*  Harnessing all that and putting it together and giving people well-cooked, delicious,
*  at least as delicious as it can be in a disaster zone.
*  That's when World Central Kitchen as we know it today sort of emerged as a fully formed
*  concept.
*  The first pictures now coming in from Puerto Rico after taking a direct hit.
*  Hurricane Maria slamming into the island.
*  And as you heard one official saying the island is destroyed.
*  Shortly after that, he flew to Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria had pretty much left
*  the entire island without water and in darkness.
*  He flew in on one of the first commercial jets that went back in.
*  He got a couple of his chef buddies whose kitchens were closed and they just decided
*  to start cooking.
*  They were basically just serving pots of stew, chicken stew in front of the restaurants.
*  The lines got longer.
*  And of course, chefs are a really specific kind of creature.
*  They really like to help their community.
*  They're really about feeding people.
*  So all the people who were chefs or cooks on the ground in Puerto Rico who could wanted
*  And you had all these chefs in the states who wanted to fly down and help if they could
*  too.
*  So you had this constant flow of chefs coming in and out.
*  That's when I went down and followed him around for about a week.
*  And what did you say?
*  Well, one of the most striking things was his ability to get food to remote places in
*  ways the Salvation Army couldn't and other government agencies that were on the ground
*  couldn't.
*  You know, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, doesn't deliver food.
*  It contracts with people to deliver food.
*  So you have all these steps of bureaucracy you have to go through to get those contracts.
*  And then FEMA says you have to have a bottle of water and this and that in those boxes.
*  There's a lot of structure to be able to meet the rules and regulations of FEMA.
*  So Jose doesn't really care about rules and regulations very much.
*  So he just got his troops together and figured out where people needed food.
*  He had this big paper map he'd carry around and lay out and had a Sharpie and hid circle
*  villages where he'd heard people needed food or where a bridge was out.
*  And then he would dispatch people to get the food there.
*  Now, how are you going to do that?
*  He was staying in a hotel where some National Guard and military police were staying to
*  go patrol areas to make sure they were safe.
*  He would tuck his big aluminum pans of food into the back of those guys' cars and say,
*  could you stop and drop these off at this church?
*  During that time in Puerto Rico, he funded a lot of it off of his own credit cards or
*  with cash.
*  And then he's on the phone with people like the president of Goya or his golf buddies
*  who are well connected saying, hey, we need some money.
*  Can you send some money for this?
*  Can you send some money for that?
*  So he just developed this network almost overnight.
*  I mean, he is very much a general in the field.
*  He wears this orvis fishing vest, has cigars in one pocket, money in the other, and he
*  just sets out to feed people.
*  And there were deliveries that were as simple as he and a couple of folks taking plastic
*  bags with food and wading through a flooded parking lot to an apartment building where
*  an older person had been stuck for a few days and couldn't get out.
*  So driving up to a community that had been cut off, there was a church that was trying
*  to distribute food.
*  We drive through this little mountain road and get to this church.
*  We start unloading the food and the congregation is inside the church.
*  Jose comes in and the pastor thanks him so much.
*  And the 20 people or so who were there gather around Jose and they begin praying.
*  And he puts his head down.
*  He's a Catholic.
*  He's a man who prays.
*  He puts his head down.
*  He's in the middle of these folks and he starts to pray with them.
*  And then pulls out his map, circles another spot, and the group is off to the next place.
*  And when Russia invades Ukraine, he immediately decided it was time for World Central Kitchen
*  to step into a war zone.
*  You know, so many people needed to eat.
*  So many Ukrainians were crossing the border into Poland.
*  There are refugees in several countries surrounding Ukraine.
*  So a lot of the work that they did was feeding the refugees.
*  They set up big operations around train stations, places where refugees were coming.
*  And then they were able to get into cities.
*  One of their operations did get hit with some armaments early on.
*  Nobody was hurt badly.
*  But I think that was the first time that they realized this was an actually more dangerous
*  situation than perhaps going in after there's been an earthquake.
*  The other thing that really made a difference here is Jose Andres and World Central Kitchen
*  would broadcast on social media live from the kitchens.
*  In the beginning, he'd be holding up his phone and saying, we put out three million meals
*  for the people of Puerto Rico, chefs for Puerto Rico.
*  It was very infectious.
*  And now one of the standard operating procedures for people who are in the World Central Kitchens
*  is to hold up the phone like that.
*  You can see the kitchen busy in the back and talk about how many meals they've served.
*  You know, they have these kind of wild meal counts, which one presumes are pretty accurate.
*  But they're like, we serve 320,000 meals this morning to the people of Laveed.
*  I mean, that scale seems important to know.
*  This is not the kind of work that feeds a few people in a few towns.
*  When you're talking about 300,000 meals in a morning, you're talking about something
*  that begins, it would seem, to rival the scope and the reach of the groups that we tend to
*  think of as the most important in the disaster relief world.
*  Absolutely.
*  And the meals, there are lots and lots and lots of meals, but also World Central Kitchen
*  hires local cooks.
*  They'll hire food truck operators who obviously have no work and pay them to go out and deliver
*  the meals.
*  They'll pay local cooks to come in and cook.
*  That's what they do with a lot of their donations, which is very different than other aid organizations.
*  And this then helps the local economy.
*  He's trying to buy as much local food as he can.
*  That keeps the economy going in the time of a disaster.
*  So that's a piece of his operation that is a little different than traditional aid operations.
*  So walk us up to October 7th when Hamas attacked Israel.
*  What does Chef Jose Andres and the World Kitchen do?
*  He had had such impact in Ukraine.
*  And I think the organization itself thought that they had the infrastructure to now take
*  food into another war zone.
*  Gaza, of course, was nothing like Ukraine.
*  But World Central Kitchen shows up.
*  They're nimble.
*  They start to connect with local chefs.
*  Right now they have about 60 kitchens in the areas around Gaza, and they've hired about
*  400 Palestinians to help do that.
*  Getting the food into Gaza became the difficulty.
*  How do you actually get the food into the Gaza Strip?
*  Large amounts of food that require trucks.
*  You've got to realize getting food into Gaza right now requires going through Israeli checkpoints.
*  And that slows the operation down.
*  You might get eight trucks a day, and that is such a small amount of food.
*  And this has been incredibly difficult for any aid operations.
*  So World Central Kitchen, playing on the experience that they had in a war zone and
*  working with government entities and trying to coordinate permissions, they took that
*  experience from Ukraine and were trying to apply it in the Gaza Strip.
*  Now they had worked for a long time with Israeli officials.
*  They wanted to make sure that they could get their food in.
*  And they decided that the best way to do it would be to take food off of ships, get it
*  in a warehouse, and then get that food into Gaza.
*  It took a long time to pull those permissions through, but they were able to get the permissions
*  they needed and set this system up so they could move the food fairly quickly into North
*  Gaza.
*  And once they get those permissions, how big a player do they become in Gaza?
*  World Central Kitchen became kind of a fulcrum point for getting food aid in to Gaza in a
*  larger and more established humanitarian aid operations couldn't, in part because they
*  were small and nimble in their way.
*  So the amount of food they were moving maybe wasn't as large as some of the more established
*  humanitarian aid organizations, but they had so much goodwill.
*  They had so much logistical knowledge.
*  They were working with local Palestinians who knew the food systems and who understood
*  how to get things in and out.
*  So they were able to find a way to use a humanitarian corridor to have permissions from the Israeli
*  government to be able to move this food back and forth.
*  And that's always been the secret to World Central Kitchen is incredibly nimble.
*  So just like in Puerto Rico, they seem to win over just about everybody and do the seemingly
*  impossible.
*  Right.
*  And World Central Kitchen says they delivered 43 million meals to Gazans since the start
*  of the war.
*  And I don't think there was any other group that could have pulled this off.
*  Hey, this is Naomi and Chef Olivier.
*  We're at the Dina Balak kitchen.
*  We've got the mise en place.
*  Tell us a little bit about it, Chef.
*  And then this caravan, this fairly efficient caravan of armored vehicles labeled with World
*  Central Kitchen logo on the roof, on the sides.
*  The idea was they head on this humanitarian corridor.
*  They head on this road.
*  The seven people who went all in vests, three of whom are security people from Great Britain.
*  You have another World Central Kitchen employee who has handled operations in Asia, in Central
*  America.
*  She's quite a veteran of the World Central Kitchen operation.
*  And you have a young man who someone told me was like the Michael Jordan of humanitarian
*  aid who hooked up with World Central Kitchen in Poland.
*  He was a hospitality student and had just become an indispensable make it happen guy.
*  And you have a Palestinian guy, he's 25, a driver.
*  So this is the team.
*  They have all the clearances.
*  They have the well marked vehicles.
*  It seemed like a very simple surgical kind of operation.
*  And of course, now as we know, it was anything but that.
*  After the break, my colleague, Adam Raskon, on what happened to the World Central Kitchen
*  workers in that caravan.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Adam, what ends up happening to this convoy that our colleague, Kim Severson, just described
*  from World Central Kitchen?
*  So what we know is that members of the World Central Kitchen had been at a warehouse in
*  Darrell Bella in the central Gaza Strip.
*  They had just unloaded about 100 tons of food aid that had been brought via a maritime
*  route to the coast of the Gaza Strip.
*  When they departed the warehouse, they were in three cars.
*  Two of the cars were armored cars and one was a soft skin car, according to the organization.
*  When the cars reached the coastal road known as El Rashid Street, they started to make
*  their way south.
*  What do we know about how much the World Central Kitchen would have told the Israeli military
*  about their plans to be on this road?
*  Yeah, so the World Central Kitchen said that its movements were coordinated.
*  In military speak or in technical speak, people often refer to this as deconfliction.
*  So basically, this process is something that not only the World Central Kitchen, but the
*  telecommunications companies going out to repair damaged telecommunications infrastructure,
*  others would use where they basically provide the Israeli military with information about
*  the people who are traveling, their ID numbers, their names, the license plate numbers of
*  the cars they'll be traveling in.
*  They'll sort of explain where their destination is.
*  The general process is that the Israelis will then come back to them and say, you're
*  approved to travel from this time and you can take this specific route.
*  And do we know if that happened?
*  If the IDF said you're approved, use this route on this night.
*  So we heard from the World Central Kitchen that they did receive this approval.
*  The military hasn't come out and said that it wasn't approved.
*  So I think it's fair to assume that their movements were coordinated and deconflicted.
*  Okay.
*  So what happens as this seemingly pre-approved and coordinated convoy trip is making this
*  leg of the journey?
*  They started to make their way south towards Raffa and the three cars suddenly came under
*  fire.
*  The Israeli army unleashes powerful and devastating strikes on the three cars in the convoy.
*  Most likely from a drone.
*  The strikes rip through the cars, killing everyone inside.
*  Shortly thereafter, ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent are dispatched to the location
*  and they retrieve the dead bodies.
*  They bring those bodies to a hospital and at the hospital, the bodies are laid out and
*  journalists start to report to the world that indeed five members of the World Central
*  Kitchen staff have been killed.
*  And the Palestine Red Crescent teams were continuing to search for other bodies and
*  eventually brought back two more bodies to the hospital for a total of seven people killed
*  in these airstrikes.
*  And when the sun comes up, what does it end up looking like?
*  The scene of these struck trucks from this convoy.
*  So early in the morning when the sun comes up, a number of Palestinian journalists headed
*  out to the coastal road and started taking pictures and videos.
*  And I received a series of videos from one of the reporters that I was in touch with
*  essentially showing three cars, all heavily damaged.
*  One had a World Central Kitchen logo on top of it with a gaping hole in the middle of
*  the roof. A second car was completely charred.
*  You could barely recognize the structure of the car.
*  The inside of it had been completely charred and the front smashed.
*  And do we know if the strike on this convoy was the only strike happening in this area?
*  In other words, is it possible this convoy was caught in some kind of a crossfire or
*  in the middle of a firefight or does it appear that this was quite narrow?
*  And was the Israeli army targeting these specific vehicles, whether or not they realized
*  who was in it?
*  We don't have any other indication that there was another strike on that road around
*  that time. What that suggests, of course, is that this convoy was targeted.
*  Now, whether Israeli officials knew who was in it, whether they were aid workers, seems
*  like a yet unresolved question.
*  But it does feel very clear that the trucks in this convoy were deliberately struck.
*  Yes, I do think the trucks in this convoy were deliberately struck.
*  What is the reaction to these airstrikes on this convoy and to the death of these aid
*  workers?
*  Well, one of the first reactions is from the World Central Kitchen's founder, Jose
*  Andres.
*  Chef Jose Andres, who founded World Central Kitchen, calling them angels.
*  He said he was heartbroken and grieving and adding the Israeli government needs to stop
*  this indiscriminate killing.
*  And then he accused Israel of using food as a weapon.
*  What I know is that we were targeted deliberately, nonstop, until everybody was dead in
*  this convoy.
*  And he just seemed devastated and quite angry.
*  And so what is the reaction from not just World Central Kitchen, but from the rest of
*  the world to this airstrike?
*  There's frankly fury and outrage.
*  The White House says it is outraged by an Israeli airstrike that killed seven aid workers
*  in Gaza, including one American.
*  President Biden, who has been becoming increasingly critical of Israel's approach to
*  this war, he came out and said that he was outraged and heartbroken.
*  Certainly sharper in tone than we have heard in the past.
*  He says Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately
*  needed help to civilians.
*  Incidents like yesterday's simply should not happen.
*  Israel also has not.
*  And we're seeing similar outrage from foreign governments.
*  The British Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, the dreadful events of the last two days
*  are a moment when we should mourn the loss of these brave humanitarian workers, including
*  said that the airstrikes were completely unacceptable.
*  And he called on Israel to explain how this happened and to make changes to ensure that
*  aid workers could be safe.
*  So amid all this, what does Israel have to say about the attack, about how it happened,
*  about why it happened?
*  The response from Israel this time was much different compared to other controversial
*  airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.
*  Often when we're reporting on these issues, we'll hear from the army that they're
*  investigating a given incident.
*  It will take days, if not weeks, to receive updates on where that investigation stands.
*  There are instances where Israel does take responsibility for harming civilians, but
*  it's often rare.
*  This time, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, comes out with a video message saying
*  that Israel had unintentionally harmed innocent civilians.
*  And that was the first indication or public indication that Israel was going to take
*  responsibility for what had happened.
*  The IDF works together closely with the World Central Kitchen and greatly appreciates the
*  important work that they do.
*  We later heard from the military's chief of staff, Herzilevi, issued a video statement
*  in English.
*  I want to be very clear.
*  The strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCK aid workers.
*  It was a mistake that followed a misidentification.
*  And he said this mistake had come after a misidentification.
*  He said it was in the middle of a war, in a very complex condition.
*  But this incident was a grave mistake.
*  We are sorry for the unintentional harm to the members of WCK.
*  He was clear that this shouldn't have happened.
*  I want to talk about that statement because it seems to suggest that word misidentification,
*  that the Israeli army believed that somebody else was in this convoy, that it wasn't a
*  bunch of aid workers.
*  That's possible, although it's extremely vague and cryptic language that genuinely is
*  difficult to understand.
*  And it's a question that us in the Jerusalem Bureau have been asking ourselves.
*  I'm curious if the Israeli government has said anything in all of its statements so
*  far about whether it noticed these markings on these three cars in the convoy, because
*  that, I think, for so many people stands out as making misidentification hard to understand.
*  It seems like perhaps a random pickup truck could be misidentified as perhaps a vehicle
*  being used by a Hamas militant.
*  But a group of World Central Kitchen trucks with their name all over it driving down a
*  known aid corridor, that becomes harder to understand as misidentification.
*  Yeah, it's an important question.
*  And at this moment, we don't know exactly what the Israeli reconnaissance drones could
*  see and whether or not they were able to see in the darkness of the night the markings
*  of the World Central Kitchen on the cars.
*  But what is clear is that when the cars were found in the morning, right there was the
*  big emblazoned logo of the World Central Kitchen.
*  Mm hmm.
*  I'm curious how you think about the speed with which Israel came out and said it was
*  in the wrong here, because as you said, that's not how Israel typically reacts to many of
*  these situations.
*  And that makes me think that it might have something to do with the nature of the aid
*  group that was the target of these airstrikes, the World Central Kitchen and its story.
*  I think it does have to do with this particular group.
*  This is a group that's led by a celebrity chef, very high profile, who has gone around
*  the world to conflict zones, disaster areas to provide food aid.
*  And I also think it has to do with the people who were killed, most of who were Western
*  foreign aid workers.
*  Frankly, I don't think we would be having this conversation if a group of Palestinian aid
*  workers had been killed.
*  Nor perhaps would you be having the reaction that we have had so far from the Israeli
*  government.
*  I would agree with that.
*  Adam, at the end of the day, what is going to be the fallout from all of this for the
*  people of Gaza?
*  How do we think that this attack on World Central Kitchen is going to impact how food
*  medicine aid is distributed there?
*  So the World Central Kitchen has said that it's suspending its operations across Gaza
*  because it essentially seems that they don't feel they can safely operate there right
*  now.
*  And several ships that carried aid for the organization, which were sort of just on the
*  coast, those ships ended up turning back to Cyprus, carrying more than 200 tons of aid.
*  So aid that was supposed to reach the people of Gaza is now leaving Gaza because of this
*  attack.
*  Yes.
*  And it's also had a chilling effect.
*  Another aid group named Anara has also suspended its operations in Gaza.
*  And it seems that there is concern among humanitarians that other aid groups could
*  follow.
*  So in a place where people are already suffering from severe hunger, poor sanitation, the
*  spread of dangerous disease, this is only going to make the humanitarian situation,
*  which is already dire, even worse.
*  Well, Adam, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  The magnitude 7.4 earthquake that struck Taiwan on Wednesday has killed nine people, injured
*  more than 1000 and touched off several landslides.
*  It was Taiwan's strongest quake in the past 25 years, but in a blessing for the island's
*  biggest cities, its epicenter was off the island's East Coast, relatively far from
*  population centers like Taipei.
*  And the first patient to receive a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified pig
*  has fared so well that he was discharged from a Massachusetts hospital on Wednesday, just
*  two weeks after surgery.
*  Two previous transplants from genetically modified pigs both failed.
*  Doctors say the success of the latest surgery represents a major moment in medicine that,
*  if replicated, could usher in a new era of organ transplantation.
