# A Conversation With Vice President Vance
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=0.0s)]
*  A few days ago in Rome, Vice President J.D. Vance met with the new Pope. And then he sat [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=11.08s)]
*  down with my colleague, Ross Douthat, a Times opinion columnist and host of a new podcast [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=18.92s)]
*  called Interesting Times, for an interview about faith, immigration, the law, and the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=25.62s)]
*  partisan temptation to go too far. Today, Ross talks us through their conversation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=32.46s)]
*  It's Thursday, May 22nd. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  Ross, thank you for being here. I know that you've had a very long couple of days, sleepless [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=49.42s)]
*  couple of days, and we appreciate you making time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=57.06s)]
*  Michael, it is my pleasure and it is a privilege to be with you. And I have slept two nights [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=60.1s)]
*  back at home in the United States, so I am completely rested. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=65.34s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  And ready. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, just to start, tell us how this interview, which required you to leave the country and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  lose a lot of sleep, how it came about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=74.72s)]
*  Well, so like a number of people in journalism, I have known J.D. Vance, the vice president, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=78.38s)]
*  since long before he became the vice president, all the way back to when he was just a humble [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=85.7s)]
*  bestselling author and occasional contributor to the New York Times opinion pages, in fact. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=91.78s)]
*  And through that connection, I convinced him to grant me an extended interview just before [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=98.62s)]
*  he became Donald Trump's vice presidential nominee. And then a couple of months ago, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=106.54s)]
*  I launched my own new interview podcast. And of course, I came back to him and said, hey, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=112.02s)]
*  now I'm interviewing people all the time. Wouldn't you like to be interviewed again? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=118.1s)]
*  And he very graciously suggested that maybe I would like to come to Rome, where he was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=123.42s)]
*  leading the U.S. delegation to the inaugural mass of Pope Leo XIV, who is, of course, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=130.08s)]
*  the first American pope. And he basically said, why don't you come to Rome and you can [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=136.72000000000003s)]
*  interview me there? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=140.56s)]
*  I have to imagine that's a pretty tempting offer for any journalist, period, but for [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  a religious Catholic like yourself, an especially tempting offer. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=147.44s)]
*  Yes, it was quite a thing, actually, to be able to attend the inaugural mass. The vice [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  president then had a private audience with Pope Leo himself and then came directly from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  that to our interview. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=163.56s)]
*  Good to see you. Hey, guys, how are you? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=164.56s)]
*  And we have set up shop inside the American embassy to the Vatican in a kind of ornate [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=168.68s)]
*  space and room. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  My goal is to actually give you more than an hour or so. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=177.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=180.52s)]
*  We'll just go until the conversation becomes boring or until I say something really stupid. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=181.52s)]
*  Until we hit the UFOs and then you'll beat a hasty retreat. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=185.32s)]
*  And just to explain, Ross, we're going to be playing large segments of your conversation [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=190.32s)]
*  with Vance in this episode because it really helps you understand how Vance thinks. But [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=194.84s)]
*  just to understand what you're doing in this interview, what, once it's beginning, is your [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  real overriding goal for the conversation? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=207.26s)]
*  Well, the ultimate goal for the conversation is to get a frank assessment from the vice [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=210.56s)]
*  president of what the administration is actually trying to do on some of its most controversial [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=215.88s)]
*  policies, most notably immigration and trade, what the end game is, what the actual metrics [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=222.56s)]
*  for success are, and so on. But the way into that discussion starts with the place where [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=228.68s)]
*  we are and what's just happened, the inauguration of a new pope and the fact that JD Vance is [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=234.16s)]
*  like myself, a convert to Catholicism. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=241.16s)]
*  And there is this striking tension between where the Vatican, the Catholic bishops, the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=244.08s)]
*  last pope, probably the new pope, tend to stand on immigration and Trump administration [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  policy and generally the sort of populist attitude towards immigration in America and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=256.64s)]
*  Europe. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=263.24s)]
*  And briefly, what exactly is the pope and the Catholic Church's view on immigration, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=264.24s)]
*  in particular on how the United States should be thinking about immigration? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=269.88s)]
*  So the Catholic Church does not have a formal dogmatic stance on here's how many immigrants [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=275.52s)]
*  a just society has to admit and here's how many you're allowed to deport or anything [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=283.2s)]
*  like that. But then in practice, if you look at the rhetoric of Catholic bishops, the positions [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=288.48s)]
*  taken by Pope Francis and so on, the Church leans, I think pretty clearly, in a more liberal [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=295.32s)]
*  direction on this issue and tends to be more critical of politicians who emphasize border [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=301.0s)]
*  security, more critical of politicians who emphasize deportations, and tends to stress [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=308.0s)]
*  pretty intensely the rights and dignity of migrants and their right to fair treatment. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=315.04s)]
*  So even though there isn't, again, a sort of absolute position on this, there is a running [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=321.4s)]
*  tension as immigration has become this flashpoint in the Western world between where conservative [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=326.68s)]
*  politicians are, where populist politicians are, and where a lot of leaders of the Church [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=331.64s)]
*  tend to be. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=337.0s)]
*  So that's where we started with the vice president's own Catholicism and then the always interesting [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=338.0s)]
*  and difficult relationship between American Catholic politicians and popes and the teachings [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=345.12s)]
*  of the Church. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=351.28s)]
*  I think there are sort of three ways of thinking about it and I tend to fall in the middle. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=352.28s)]
*  Okay, so way number one, and you see some Catholics or some Christians say this, is [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=358.28s)]
*  they say, well, politics is politics, policy is policy, religion is religion, and we wish [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=363.36s)]
*  the Pope all this best or we wish the Church all its best in its moral teachings, but we [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=370.44s)]
*  got to focus on policy and these are two totally separate matters. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=375.72s)]
*  But I think that's wrong because it understates the way in which all of us are informed by [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=378.44s)]
*  our moral and religious values. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=383.64s)]
*  So that's not the right way to do it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=385.48s)]
*  I think another way to do it would be to say, I'm just going to do everything the Holy Father [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  tells me to do. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  I think that would be- [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  Some people were worried about that with John F. Kennedy, as I recall. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think that would be a violation of the US Constitution. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=396.12s)]
*  But certainly, I think just my obligation more broadly as a vice president to serve [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=399.2s)]
*  the American people, you've got to think about this stuff. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  But I think the way that I take it is, on the migration question in particular, you [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=406.32s)]
*  have to think about what they've said. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=410.64s)]
*  And when the Church says, yes, we respect the right of a country to enforce its borders, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=412.76s)]
*  you also have to respect the rights of migrants, the dignity of migrants when you think about [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  questions like deportation and so forth. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=424.4s)]
*  So you have to be able to hold two ideas in your head at the same time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=426.68s)]
*  And I'm not saying I'm always perfect at it, but I at least try to think about, okay, there [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=429.88s)]
*  are obligations that we have to people who in some ways are fleeing violence or at least [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=433.26000000000005s)]
*  fleeing poverty. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  I also have a very sacred obligation, I think, to enforce the laws and to promote the common [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  good of my own country defined as the people with the legal right to be here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  One issue in particular, I talked to a lot of cardinals this weekend just because there [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=448.8s)]
*  are a lot of cardinals here in Rome. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=453.04s)]
*  And one of the arguments that I've made, very respectfully, I've had a lot of good, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=455.3s)]
*  respectful conversations, including with cardinals who very strongly disagree with my views on [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=460.82s)]
*  migration is that it's easy to get locked in sort of a left versus right. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  The left respects the dignity of migrants, the right is motivated by hatred. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=472.64s)]
*  I think far too many people, obviously that's not my view, but I think some liberal immigration [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=476.62s)]
*  advocates get locked in that view that the only reason why J.D. Vance wants to enforce [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=482.66s)]
*  the borders more stridently is because he's motivated by some kind of hatred or some kind [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=487.98s)]
*  of grievance. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=492.78s)]
*  And the point that I've tried to make is I think a lot about this question of social [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=493.78s)]
*  cohesion in the United States. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=500.14s)]
*  I think about how do we form the kind of society, again, where people can raise families, where [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=501.46s)]
*  people join in institutions together, where what I think Burke would have called the mediating [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=506.26s)]
*  layers of society are actually healthy and vibrant. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=511.08s)]
*  And I do think that those who care about what might be called the common good, they sometimes [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=514.76s)]
*  underweight how destructive to the common good immigration at the levels and at the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=520.72s)]
*  pace that we've seen over the last few years. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=527.8s)]
*  I really do think that social solidarity is destroyed when you have too much migration [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=530.0s)]
*  too quickly. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=535.06s)]
*  And so that's not because I hate the migrants or I'm motivated by grievance. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=536.28s)]
*  That's because I'm trying to preserve something in my own country where we are a unified nation. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=540.08s)]
*  And I don't think that can happen if you have too much immigration too quickly. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=544.88s)]
*  And at that point, Ross, you ask the vice president how it is he measures whether or [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  not the administration's immigration policies are actually working. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=552.48s)]
*  And Vance says that they've secured the border, but that when it comes to large scale deportations, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=556.76s)]
*  it's been more challenging. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=564.12s)]
*  He specifically points to two obstacles, a lack of resources for enforcement and then [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  what he interprets as interference from the courts. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=573.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, it's and I'm sure that New York Times listeners are going to be scandalized [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=579.1600000000001s)]
*  by this line of argumentation. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=583.84s)]
*  But I think it's really important that in some ways, the deportation infrastructure [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  that is developed in the United States is not adequate to the task given what Joe Biden [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  left us. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=595.92s)]
*  Now, there are different estimates here of how many illegal immigrants came in under [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=596.92s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=600.8s)]
*  Was it 12 million? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=601.8s)]
*  Was it 20 million? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=602.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=603.8s)]
*  And we have a back and forth about this numbers specifically, but it is absolutely the case [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=604.8s)]
*  that an unprecedented number of illegal immigrants did enter the U.S. under the Biden administration [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=610.9599999999999s)]
*  that the Trump administration inherited. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=617.56s)]
*  And it did run, I think, very explicitly on a promise to deport a substantial number of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=620.08s)]
*  those new arrivals and has, I think, can reasonably say it has a political mandate to do so. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=626.0s)]
*  So the question is how? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=631.48s)]
*  There are two things that we can do. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=634.04s)]
*  I think one thing is a little bit easier and one thing is a little bit harder. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=635.36s)]
*  And the first thing is you just have to have the actual law enforcement infrastructure [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=639.0s)]
*  to make this possible. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=643.68s)]
*  And again, I think that we should treat people humanely. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=644.68s)]
*  I think we have an obligation to treat people humanely. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=646.32s)]
*  But I do think that a lot of these illegal immigrants have to go back to where they came [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=649.96s)]
*  from. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=652.44s)]
*  And that requires more law enforcement officers. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=653.44s)]
*  It requires more beds, deportation facilities. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=656.76s)]
*  It just requires more of the basic nuts and bolts of how you run a law enforcement regime [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=659.48s)]
*  in the context of deportation. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=664.84s)]
*  That's one of the main things in the big, beautiful bill that is moving through Congress [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=667.32s)]
*  right now is more money for immigration enforcement. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=670.72s)]
*  That's what that money is for, to facilitate that deportation infrastructure. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=673.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a much more difficult question. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=677.36s)]
*  And I think you see the president's frustration. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=679.76s)]
*  I've obviously expressed public frustration on this, which is, yes, illegal immigrants [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=681.96s)]
*  by virtue of being in the United States are entitled to some due process. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=687.04s)]
*  But the due process... [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=693.0s)]
*  Under a legislative stand, to be clear, this is based on legislation. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=695.28s)]
*  The judges who are making these decisions are not inventing this standard. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=700.72s)]
*  It is a legislative standard. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=706.16s)]
*  But the amount of process that is due and how you enforce those legislative standards [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=707.68s)]
*  and how you actually bring them to bear is, I think, very much an open question. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=712.6s)]
*  And here, Vance brings up his frustration, shared no doubt by the president, with the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=716.32s)]
*  level of due process that immigrants in the country illegally are still entitled to. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=722.28s)]
*  And I think that what you've seen... [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=728.08s)]
*  And I remember when I was in law school, there were all of these people who were wanting [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=730.2s)]
*  to become immigration lawyers. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=733.72s)]
*  There was almost a certain buzz around immigration law at the time because there was so much [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  gray area, there was so much open space where the courts would interpret how to apply these [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=741.52s)]
*  rules. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=747.76s)]
*  Now, in the context of the United States in 2011, 2012, 13, when I was in law school, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=748.76s)]
*  we had significant illegal immigration, but not that much. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=754.48s)]
*  There was this idea that you could use the asylum claim process and you could use the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=757.36s)]
*  refugee process and you could use all of these other tools of the immigration enforcement [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=761.2800000000001s)]
*  regime to actually make it harder to deport illegal aliens. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=767.6400000000001s)]
*  And then what happened is a lot of very well-funded NGOs went about the process of making it much [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=771.88s)]
*  harder to deport illegal aliens. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=777.08s)]
*  And that's what we inherited in the Year of Our Lord 2025, is a whole host of legal rules [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=779.88s)]
*  and in some cases, not even legal rules as much as arguments that had been made by left-wing [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=786.88s)]
*  NGOs that hadn't actually been ruled on by the courts yet. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=792.2s)]
*  And what we're finding, of course, is that a small but substantial number of courts are [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=795.56s)]
*  just making it very, very hard for us to deport illegal aliens. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  And Stephen Miller, who of course is sort of our immigration czar in the White House, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=804.36s)]
*  a good friend of mine, he's thinking of all of these different and new statutory authorities, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=809.0s)]
*  because there are a lot of different statutory authorities the president has to enforce the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=814.12s)]
*  nation's immigration laws. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  And there is candidly frustration on the White House side that we think that the law is very [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=820.16s)]
*  clear. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=826.0s)]
*  We think the president has extraordinary plenary power. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=827.0s)]
*  Yes, you have to, you need some process to confirm that these illegal aliens are in fact [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=830.0799999999999s)]
*  illegal aliens, not American citizens. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=835.9s)]
*  But it's not like we're just throwing that process out. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=838.5999999999999s)]
*  We're trying to comply with it as much as possible and actually do the job that we were [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=842.0s)]
*  left. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=846.88s)]
*  And let me just make one final sort of philosophical point here. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=847.88s)]
*  I worry that unless the Supreme Court steps in here or unless the district courts exercise [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=851.88s)]
*  a little bit more discretion, we are running into a real conflict between two important [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=859.64s)]
*  principles in the United States. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=867.2s)]
*  Principle one, of course, is that courts interpret the law. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  I think principle two is that the American people decide how they're governed. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=872.4000000000001s)]
*  That's the fundamental small-d democratic principle that's at the heart of the American [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=877.24s)]
*  project. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=881.6400000000001s)]
*  I think that you are seeing, and I know this is inflammatory, but I think you are seeing [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=882.6400000000001s)]
*  an effort by the courts to quite literally overturn the will of the American people. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=887.0400000000001s)]
*  And to be clear, it's not most courts. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=892.0s)]
*  But I think what the Supreme Court has to do, and I saw an interview with Chief Justice [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=894.2800000000001s)]
*  Roberts recently where he said, you know, the role of the court is to check the excesses [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=897.8s)]
*  of the executive. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=902.3599999999999s)]
*  I thought that was a profoundly wrong sentiment. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=903.3599999999999s)]
*  That's one half of his job. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=907.26s)]
*  The other half of his job is to check the excesses of his own branch. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=909.06s)]
*  And you cannot have a country where the American people keep on electing immigration enforcement [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=914.76s)]
*  and the courts tell the American people they're not allowed to have what they voted for. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=920.8s)]
*  And that's where we are right now. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=925.24s)]
*  We're going to keep working it through the immigration court process, through the Supreme [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=927.0s)]
*  Court as much as possible. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=929.88s)]
*  And look, my hope is that when you ask what success is, success to me is not so much a [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=931.52s)]
*  number, though obviously I'd love to see the gross majority of the illegal immigrants who [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=936.92s)]
*  came in under Biden deported. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=941.22s)]
*  That actually is a secondary metric of success. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=943.48s)]
*  Success to me is that we have established a set of rules and principles that the courts [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=947.36s)]
*  are comfortable with and that we have the infrastructure to do that allows us to deport [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=954.54s)]
*  large numbers of illegal aliens when large numbers of illegal aliens come into the country. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=960.28s)]
*  That to me is real success. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=965.0999999999999s)]
*  But I think whether we're able to get there is a function, of course, of our efforts, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=966.0999999999999s)]
*  but also the courts themselves. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  Ross, the vice president here seems to be arguing for a judiciary that is more responsive [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=971.9s)]
*  to the will of the people when it comes to immigration, which is not traditionally how [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=978.62s)]
*  we have seen the role of the courts. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=982.9s)]
*  I mean, the whole point of having lifetime appointments, I'm not telling you anything [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=985.46s)]
*  you don't know, is that judges are insulated from public whims. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=989.02s)]
*  Their job is to interpret the Constitution, interpret longstanding precedent, regardless [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=993.14s)]
*  of what the public thinks. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=998.0600000000001s)]
*  But you get the sense that what Vance really wants is for judges to get out of the way [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=999.98s)]
*  and get to a yes to the Trump administration, regardless of what previous interpretations [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1005.78s)]
*  of a law might be, because that's what he says the American voters want. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1011.02s)]
*  I think the context for the vice president's argument is sort of twofold. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1017.3s)]
*  One, there is a longstanding perspective in American conservatism that judges and Supreme [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1021.66s)]
*  Court justices are too quick to interfere in democratic politics, to sort of impose [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1027.92s)]
*  their interpretations of the Constitution that are themselves quite debatable, rather [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1034.5s)]
*  than deferring to the executive and legislative branches, which do, in fact, represent public [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1039.3799999999999s)]
*  opinion more directly than the judiciary does, absolutely. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1046.3799999999999s)]
*  And then the other backdrop to this is that over a long period of time, especially in [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1050.62s)]
*  Western Europe, you have had this really striking dynamic where public opinion is very skeptical [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1054.74s)]
*  and critical of mass immigration. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1061.86s)]
*  And yet, in some cases, the judiciary, in some cases, the bureaucracy, in some cases, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  prime ministers and other leaders have found ways to basically ignore public sentiment. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1070.02s)]
*  And much of European politics has been defined by voters trying to vote against mass immigration, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1075.54s)]
*  not getting the policy they want, and then moving towards further right and populist [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1083.6599999999999s)]
*  parties like Marine Le Pen's national rally in France, like the Alternative for Deutschland [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1088.62s)]
*  in Germany. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1094.74s)]
*  Vance is drawing on the perspectives of European politics, this sense that the public has a [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1096.1s)]
*  desire and elites are always trying to thwart it, and judges throwing up roadblocks to the [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1102.02s)]
*  Trump administration doing deportations are part of that tradition. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1109.1s)]
*  So there are two obvious ways that an administration frustrated by the pace of deportations could [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1114.5s)]
*  try and address those frustrations. One is to try and directly change the law that governs [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1121.86s)]
*  due process for illegal immigrants, or you could look at judicial interpretations of [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1129.7s)]
*  that law that you think have been too favorable to illegal immigrants and present test cases [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1136.26s)]
*  to the Supreme Court, a Supreme Court that is friendly to executive power, and try and [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1142.94s)]
*  get those interpretations changed. I think the administration is doing some version of [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1147.38s)]
*  both of those things, but then they also have a third track that they're pursuing. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1152.98s)]
*  And we will discuss that third track, which happens to be the most controversial track, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1158.9s)]
*  after the break. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1162.8200000000002s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1163.8200000000002s)]
*  Okay, Ross, before the break, you told us that the administration's options for speeding [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1172.9s)]
*  up the pace of deportations is first, rewrite the law, second, get the Supreme Court to [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1190.42s)]
*  reinterpret the law, or to use a third option. So talk about what Vance says that third option [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1196.98s)]
*  is. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1204.1s)]
*  So the third option, this has obviously been the zone of maximal controversy under Trump. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1205.1s)]
*  The idea that you can claim some sort of wartime power that lets you deport illegal immigrants [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1212.58s)]
*  either without any due process at all, or with a kind of extremely minimal due process. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1220.58s)]
*  So it's sort of like the Trump administration is looking for a kind of wartime powers hack [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1230.3s)]
*  for this larger challenge of not having the legal infrastructure necessary for mass deportations. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1237.3s)]
*  Basically, we have this big challenge, but what if there was one neat trick in a law [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1244.62s)]
*  from the 1790s that would let us avoid having to go through all the trouble of passing new [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1249.78s)]
*  legislation or establishing new Supreme Court precedents? So I asked him about that. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1256.02s)]
*  There's a third track too, which is using existing legal authorities that haven't been [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1263.26s)]
*  used in the past, but we think are there. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1266.78s)]
*  And this is what I'm asking about. The legal authorities that you guys have tried to use [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1268.8999999999999s)]
*  have been the particular one is the Alien Enemies Act, which is an extremely aggressive [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1274.38s)]
*  claim about wartime powers that as far as I can tell, even under the most aggressive [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1280.58s)]
*  interpretation is likely to apply only to an incredibly small number of migrants. The [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1285.82s)]
*  claim is not actually that five million migrants here illegally are in a state of war against [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1292.82s)]
*  the United States, or is that the claim? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1298.22s)]
*  It's not that five million are engaged in military conflict, but I take issue that it's [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1301.26s)]
*  an aggressive interpretation, so let me back up and take some issue with the premise. I [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1308.46s)]
*  don't think that the supposition, if you look at the history and the context of those laws, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1313.5s)]
*  is that for something to be an invasion, you have to have five million uniformed combatants. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1318.86s)]
*  Yes, we don't have five million uniformed combatants, but Ross, this is where I think [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1323.66s)]
*  I have to be careful here, because some of this information, of course, is classified, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1328.62s)]
*  but I think how to put this point. I think that the courts need to be somewhat deferential. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1333.26s)]
*  In fact, I think the design is that they should be extremely deferential to these questions [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1340.58s)]
*  of political judgment made by the people's elected president of the United States, because [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1344.62s)]
*  when you say, well, there aren't five million people who are waging war, okay, but are there [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1349.02s)]
*  thousands, maybe tens of thousands of people, and then when you take their extended family, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1355.6200000000001s)]
*  their networks, is it much larger than that, who are quite dangerous people, who I think [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1362.42s)]
*  very intentionally came to the United States to cause violence or to at least profit from [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1368.8200000000002s)]
*  violence and they're fine if violence is an incidental effect of it? Yeah, I do, man. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1375.0200000000002s)]
*  I think the people underappreciate the level of public safety stress that we're under when [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1380.06s)]
*  the president talks about how bad crime is. The one thing I'd love for the American media [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1386.1s)]
*  to do a little bit more is really go to a migrant community where you have, say, 60% [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1392.1s)]
*  legal immigrants and 40% illegal immigrants. The level of chaos, the level of violence, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1398.82s)]
*  I think truly pre-modern brutality that some of these communities have gotten used to, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1405.72s)]
*  whatever law was written, I think it vests us with the power to take very serious action against [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1412.6799999999998s)]
*  this. It's bad. It's bad. It's worse than people appreciate and it's not, Donald Trump, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1419.36s)]
*  most of your listeners probably hate the president I serve under and probably hate me, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1425.08s)]
*  maybe not your listeners, but a lot of New York Times readers. We'll talk about that question in [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1429.56s)]
*  a minute. I would just ask them, do not filter this through the, I see President Trump and Vice [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1435.04s)]
*  President Vance up there and I sort of immediately assume that they're lying to me and that they're [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1440.1200000000001s)]
*  motivated by some bad value. This is not sustainable. It's not just sustainable like, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1443.92s)]
*  oh, this is more immigrants than we used to have. This is a level of invasion that I think our laws, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1450.52s)]
*  we already have laws to help us deal with and I wish the courts were more deferential and we're [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1458.92s)]
*  going to see, again, we're very early innings in the court process and even some of the worst, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1464.04s)]
*  capital W worst Supreme Court decisions that have been made on, the media says, oh, this is a big [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1468.84s)]
*  blow to the administration. I mean, a lot of these things are very narrow procedural rulings. I think [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1474.4s)]
*  that we're very early innings here on what the court is going to interpret the law to mean. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1479.68s)]
*  Right. Shouldn't this sort of barbaric and medieval landscape that you're describing show [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1483.88s)]
*  up in violent crime statistics? Oh, sometimes no, because the people who are most victimized [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1491.04s)]
*  by this, Ross, they're not running to the FBI. They're not running to the local police. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1497.16s)]
*  Okay. But certainly, I mean, if you look at, I mean, hell, look at the number of people dying [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1500.44s)]
*  of fentanyl overdoses. Again, just go substantively, qualitatively. You go to these communities and you [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1505.52s)]
*  see what they're dealing with. I really think that we underappreciate just how violent these [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1513.56s)]
*  cartels are and how much they've made life, I think, pretty unbearable for frankly, a lot of [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1519.32s)]
*  native born American citizens, but also a lot of legal American migrants, especially those along [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1524.6s)]
*  the southern border. Ross, when the vice president refers to communities that are in his characterization, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1529.6399999999999s)]
*  riddled with crime from illegal immigrants, which communities do you think he's talking about? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1535.28s)]
*  Well, as you heard, he says communities along the southern border. I suspect he also has in mind [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1539.84s)]
*  claims about say, gang activity in an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, there have been a [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1546.1200000000001s)]
*  number of anecdotal cases. But as I said to him, I think, you know, these are anecdotes. They're not [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1553.28s)]
*  statistical evidence. And as he's describing this reaching back and repurposing old laws for the [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1559.6000000000001s)]
*  purpose of deportations, I ask him to talk about or think about some of the moral risks involved in [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1568.6s)]
*  that. Well, so what you're describing is, again, you and I both live through the Bush presidency, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1576.04s)]
*  right? And there are elements of what you might call a kind of war on terror mentality, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1581.4399999999998s)]
*  that you're taking vis-a-vis the cartels or people associated with the cartels or people allegedly [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1586.84s)]
*  associated with gangs and cartels, that seems to me similar to the approach taken to anyone [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1592.44s)]
*  associated with Islamic terrorism and so on in the aftermath of September 11th. And again, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1599.72s)]
*  you remember and I remember that in more than a few cases, right, this ended up with situations [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1605.72s)]
*  where the US was taking people into custody and remanding them to black sites and so on, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1613.6000000000001s)]
*  who turned out unsurprisingly not to be number one al-Qaeda terrorists, right? And to the extent [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1619.04s)]
*  that it is possible and it is somewhat difficult for the media to do this, but to the extent that [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1625.24s)]
*  it's possible for the media to examine the kind of figures and individuals that you guys have been [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1630.12s)]
*  trying to essentially remand to prison in El Salvador, right, without, you know, extensive [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1636.52s)]
*  legal process, it just seems like this system is ripe for war on terror style abuses, where you are [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1644.52s)]
*  going to be sending people to prison in El Salvador that advertises itself as a terrible place, and [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1651.0s)]
*  one, some of those people are probably going to be innocent, two, some of them are going to be people [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1657.48s)]
*  who have committed a crime, who have some kind of gang affiliation, but who under normal American law, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1663.12s)]
*  non-war time law, would end up going to jail for six months or a year or something, and again, they're [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1669.24s)]
*  going to disappear potentially into a system for a decade or more or something like that, and that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1674.68s)]
*  just seems like you are creating a context where injustice is inevitable even if your intentions [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1679.6s)]
*  are just to bring peace and order to communities along the border or anything else. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1685.52s)]
*  Well, look, first of all, I understand your point, and making these judgments, if you take the [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1691.0s)]
*  teachings of our faith seriously, they are hard, right? I'm not going to pretend that I haven't [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1698.48s)]
*  struggled with some of this, that I haven't thought about whether we're doing the precisely right [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1704.92s)]
*  thing, so it's a fair point, and I know that you think you've got me trapped here. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1709.48s)]
*  I don't think I have you. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1714.4s)]
*  No, I do. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1715.68s)]
*  All right, let me be perfectly honest, I'm not interested in having you trapped here. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1717.0s)]
*  We're having a conversation in Rome as a journalist and a vice president, but also as two Catholics, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1725.24s)]
*  I'm giving you shit, Ross, trust me. To be clear, I think it's a totally fair question. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1726.0s)]
*  I'm interested in what politics does to your soul, right? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1731.2s)]
*  Yes, of course. So number one, the concern that you raise is fair, okay? The concern that you [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1736.36s)]
*  raise is fair. There has to be some way in which you're asking yourself as you go about enforcing [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1741.72s)]
*  the law, even to your point against some very dangerous people, that you're enforcing the law [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1748.32s)]
*  consistent with the Catholic Church's moral dictates and so forth. And also to be clear, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1752.56s)]
*  I'm the vice- [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1757.1200000000001s)]
*  And also, I mean, after that pitch to your soul, an American law and basic principles of- [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1757.48s)]
*  Most importantly, American law. But we're talking about, you know, we're in Rome, and so that's why [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1763.76s)]
*  I brought up the Catholic faith part of it. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1767.8s)]
*  The American flag is positioned behind you. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1769.24s)]
*  Sure. So here's the thing. So with the caveat that I'm the vice president of the United States, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1770.24s)]
*  and I am hardly an expert in every single edge case or every single case that has become a viral [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1779.28s)]
*  sensation or that people have criticized us over, but I am, you know, pretty well read on some of [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1785.36s)]
*  the cases. Typically, what I find when I look at the worst cases, I mean, the ones that the media [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1790.96s)]
*  seems so preoccupied with, I would make a couple of observations about it. Number one, it is hard [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1797.76s)]
*  to take seriously- Now, this doesn't absolve me from taking- from doing my duty as an American [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1804.72s)]
*  leader and hopefully as a Christian leader too. But it is hard to take seriously the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  extraordinarily emotive condemnations of people who don't care about the problem that I'm trying [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1817.68s)]
*  to solve and that the president is trying to solve. So when I see people who for legitimately [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1824.32s)]
*  four years told me that I was a xenophobe for thinking that what Joe Biden was doing at the [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1830.08s)]
*  border was a serious problem, I am less willing- there's a witness element to this, and I'm less [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1834.32s)]
*  willing to believe the witness of people who are now saying that this MS-13 gang member, and we'll [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1840.56s)]
*  talk about that case in a second, this guy, this guy is somehow a very sympathetic person, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1846.8799999999999s)]
*  and you violated his civil rights, etc., etc. Okay? So that's number one. Number two, I still have an [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1853.28s)]
*  obligation to think about these cases, and I'll tell you, you know, a lot of times I'll read about [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1861.44s)]
*  these cases and I'll reach out to the people who are enforcing immigration law and I'll try to find [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1865.3600000000001s)]
*  out what exactly is going on. I haven't asked every question about every case, but the ones where [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1869.2s)]
*  I have asked questions and I try to get to the bottom of what's going on, I feel quite comfortable [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1875.44s)]
*  what's happened, and the one that I spent the most time understanding is the one of the, you [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1880.08s)]
*  know, the Maryland father and- And so here, as we're talking about moral risks, the vice president [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1884.6399999999999s)]
*  himself brings up the case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia. Right, the Maryland man in the United States, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1891.9199999999998s)]
*  illegally, who was by the admission of the Trump administration, mistakenly deported without due [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1897.76s)]
*  process to this prison in El Salvador. Right, and the vice president wants to go to that [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1903.92s)]
*  controversial, much discussed case because in his mind, this is both an edge case that does raise [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1909.92s)]
*  some real moral and political questions, but also ultimately a case that vindicates the Trump [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1917.1200000000001s)]
*  administration's approach. And how does it, in his mind, vindicate the administration's approach? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1921.92s)]
*  His argument is that in spite of the attempts by liberals and critics of the administration's [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1928.0s)]
*  policy to portray Garcia as a law-abiding, innocent victim, he is in fact exactly the kind [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1933.04s)]
*  of person who should be liable for deportation from the United States. I think this guy was [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1940.8799999999999s)]
*  not just a gang member, but a reasonably high-level gang member in MS-13. I think he had engaged in [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1947.44s)]
*  some pretty ugly conduct. Legally, he had had multiple hearings before an immigration judge. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1953.04s)]
*  He had a valid deportation order. What he also had was a sort of exception, what's called a [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  withholding order, that basically said, yes, you can deport this guy. No one doubts that we could [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1966.48s)]
*  have deported this guy, but you can't deport this guy to El Salvador because of particular conditions [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1971.28s)]
*  that obtained in, I believe, 2019 when this case was adjudicated. So you fast forward to 2025, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1978.8799999999999s)]
*  we deport this guy, the courts hold that we've made a mistake, and then it eventually gets to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1985.2s)]
*  the Supreme Court. And I believe, and we're getting in the weeds a little bit of the legal [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1990.32s)]
*  technicalities, but I believe the court term is you must facilitate his return. And I sat in lunch [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=1993.1200000000001s)]
*  with Bukele, the leader of El Salvador, with the president of the United States, and with others, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2002.0s)]
*  and talked about this case. And Bukele basically said, I don't want to send this guy back. I think [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2006.64s)]
*  he's a bad guy. I want him in, he's my citizen. He's in a prison in El Salvador, and I think that's [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2011.76s)]
*  where he belongs. And our attitude was, okay, what are we really going to do? Are we going to exert [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2017.68s)]
*  extraordinary diplomatic pressure to bring a guy back to the United States who is a citizen of a [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2022.8s)]
*  foreign country who we had a valid deportation order with? I understand there may be disagreements [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2027.92s)]
*  about the judgments that we made here, but there's just something that it's hard to take serious [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2032.72s)]
*  when so many of the people who are saying we made a terrible error here are the same people who made [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2038.16s)]
*  no protests about how this guy got into the country in the first place or what Joe Biden [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2044.72s)]
*  did for four years to the American southern border. Listening to Vance here, I was struck by [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2049.84s)]
*  how much issue he takes with those who question this approach. And really he takes issue with [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2055.6s)]
*  the fact that those who don't recognize the problem as he sees it don't really have much [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2063.68s)]
*  ground to stand on in criticizing these edge cases, as he calls them. Basically, he seems to see [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2070.72s)]
*  left-leaning critics as unworthy of much engagement around this issue, which just struck me. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2079.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think the general administration view is that a lot of the criticisms that they get from [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2088.5600000000004s)]
*  democratic politicians and liberal activists and so on are, if not in bad faith, at least just sort of [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2099.76s)]
*  non-responsive to what they see as the actual problem that they're trying to solve. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2108.48s)]
*  The criticisms are basically intended to set up impossible roadblocks to establish standards of [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2112.8799999999997s)]
*  due process that would make it impossible for the Trump administration to deport anyone. Now, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2120.72s)]
*  personally, I think it really is true that a lot of critics of the administration's policy [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2127.68s)]
*  basically don't want to deport anyone or anyone except a few of the absolute worst cases. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2132.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's also true that Vance was not exactly being responsive to the question of whether the [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2138.96s)]
*  system itself is going to create abuses, including abuses that could fall upon American citizens, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2145.2s)]
*  which seems like, especially like a live issue, given that the president of the United States [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2153.36s)]
*  floated the idea of sending American criminals to an El Salvadoran prison as well. So I asked him [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2159.04s)]
*  about this. In that meeting, the other thing that the president of the United States said was that [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2166.4s)]
*  he hoped or aspired to a situation where he could potentially send American citizens [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2173.12s)]
*  to El Salvador's prisons. The worst of the worst- [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2178.8s)]
*  And he also said explicitly he would follow the law and he would follow American courts on this. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2181.12s)]
*  So I feel like it's unreasonable for the president to say, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2185.84s)]
*  here's this thing I'd like to do so long as it's consistent with the law. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2189.36s)]
*  I think that you should be able to see, though, why in the context of sending illegal immigrants [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2193.2s)]
*  to an El Salvadoran prison and claiming to be unable for diplomatic reasons to bring them back, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2201.2799999999997s)]
*  the prospect of them saying, and we'd like to send US citizens to that [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2208.48s)]
*  prison, would raise some concerns about how the administration uses the immigration powers that [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2212.64s)]
*  you think it should have under arguable wartime conditions. Again, regardless of the particulars [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2220.08s)]
*  of a case, it just seems like you are setting up a machinery that people of good faith, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2229.44s)]
*  who are not hostile to your policies, would reasonably regard as dangerous [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2237.2s)]
*  to particular people who are caught up in the system. That's all. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2242.88s)]
*  I understand the point, especially as it's what the president says or what I say is refracted [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2246.48s)]
*  through the lens of an American press that I have my complaints with. But what if the president, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2253.6s)]
*  again, I'm going to defend my boss here. What do you say? I'm going to think about doing this [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2259.6s)]
*  only in cases of the very, very worst people, number one, and number two, only if it's consistent [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2266.7999999999997s)]
*  with American law. I think that if that was the headline that was reproduced, the president is [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2274.48s)]
*  considering sending the very worst violent gang members in America to a foreign prison, so long as [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2279.2s)]
*  that is a legal thing to do. I don't think that would inspire so much passionate resistance. That's [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2286.56s)]
*  my understanding of the American people. In a context where the administration... [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  By the time you're all done talking about this administration's approach to immigration and how [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2295.68s)]
*  Vance thinks about it, I wonder what you've concluded about the relationship between this [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2299.52s)]
*  Catholic vice president who's in Rome and clearly thinking about some of the disapproval emanating [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  from the Vatican and this pretty aggressive policy that Vance is a part of inside the Trump [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2311.28s)]
*  administration when it comes to immigration. I raised the war on terror parallel in our [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2318.4s)]
*  conversation for a reason. I think that it is a very common phenomenon for politicians with [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2324.48s)]
*  sincere religious convictions to end up in a place where they feel like they have obligations to [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2334.32s)]
*  the safety of the country and its common good, as certainly the George W. Bush administration felt [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2344.48s)]
*  after 9-11 that leads them to set up systems that are designed to further a particular end, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2350.16s)]
*  but that are exposed to abuses. This is not a novel story in American history. It's not a novel [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2360.3199999999997s)]
*  story in politics. I think the vice president's response, he's arguing that while there may be [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2367.04s)]
*  similar risks, right now what critics and skeptics see as serious abuses aren't actually [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2373.44s)]
*  happening. I do think that the Supreme Court has already imposed limits on the Trump administration's [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2381.36s)]
*  ability to do these kind of speedy to an El Salvadoran prison deportations that hopefully [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2390.32s)]
*  limits how much moral risk the administration's policy creates in the future. But I am also very [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2396.96s)]
*  skeptical that if we could see with X-ray vision each and every case of someone who's already been [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2403.28s)]
*  sent to these prisons that the vice president's claims that there have been no abuses or no [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2409.36s)]
*  serious abuses would hold up. I think that's just not the way the world usually works. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2415.84s)]
*  Aaron Ross Ross, you end this interview by asking the vice president how policies like [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2420.0s)]
*  these expedited deportations are playing out with a very specific kind of voter. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2426.8s)]
*  So a couple times in this interview, you've said something to me to the effect of, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2433.36s)]
*  I know New York Times readers hate me or I know New York Times readers don't like me and so on. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2438.48s)]
*  And I want you to explain what you're up to here. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2442.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm a New York Times columnist and this is a New York Times podcast and at various moments in the [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2446.2400000000002s)]
*  interview, the vice president commented on the fact that he expects that most New York Times [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2451.76s)]
*  readers and listeners are not likely to agree with him and so on. And on the one hand, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2457.36s)]
*  that's a fair characterization probably. On the other hand, I do think that there are people who [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2462.08s)]
*  read the New York Times, listen to the Daily, read my column and so on, who did end up supporting [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2468.16s)]
*  the Trump Vance ticket in 2024 and many others who maybe didn't support it but actually woke [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2475.44s)]
*  up the morning after the victory and said, you know what, I was glad in the end that they won. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2482.48s)]
*  And I think that that constituency is in fact incredibly important to the political success [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2487.84s)]
*  or lack thereof of the Trump administration. That the ability to win over a segment of, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2496.48s)]
*  let's say, you know, upper middle class to elite America to get them to vote for a populist [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2503.36s)]
*  administration is a pretty big political feat. And it's one that the Trump administration should [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2510.08s)]
*  not wish to see lightly squandered. And I think in lots of different ways, the aggressiveness of [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2515.76s)]
*  what the Trump administration has done on immigration, on trade policy, on a host of smaller [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2523.0400000000004s)]
*  issues related to, you know, universities and doge cuts and so on, Trump administration has sort of [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2529.2000000000003s)]
*  freaked out and alienated people in that category especially who voted for them last November. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2536.0800000000004s)]
*  And you asked the vice president what he would say to that constituency. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2543.44s)]
*  So then generally, you're going to face the voters by proxy in the midterm. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2549.6800000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2555.6s)]
*  You may face the voters personally in some future, right? But to this constituency [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2556.56s)]
*  that was pro-Trump, again, maybe it's to its own surprise, but has found itself sort of shocked at [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2561.36s)]
*  various points in the first few months, what is your pitch to them right now? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2567.36s)]
*  Yeah. I guess my pitch to them would be we came into the administration with what we believed was [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2570.96s)]
*  a mandate from the American people to make government more responsive to the elected [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2577.84s)]
*  will of the people and less responsive to bureaucratic intransigence. And changing that [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2583.12s)]
*  is not perfect. And I won't even say that we've gotten every decision right. I think that, you [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2589.84s)]
*  know, sometimes, you know, even Elon has admitted we made a mistake, we corrected the mistake. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2594.4s)]
*  So the point is not that this is perfect. The point is that it was a necessary part of making [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2599.6s)]
*  the people's government more responsive to the people. And I think that if you look over the [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2603.6s)]
*  next, you know, in two years, you look at the past two years, or in four years, you look at the past [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2610.72s)]
*  four years. What I hope to be able to say and what I think is true today and will still be true then [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2614.88s)]
*  is that we actually have done with some bumps, we've done a good job at making the government [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2620.7999999999997s)]
*  more responsive, and that this sort of feeling of shock, I don't dismiss it or diminish it, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2626.88s)]
*  but I think that the system actually needed some pretty significant reform. And I'd ask people for [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2633.84s)]
*  patience because we're on the inside of this, you elected us to do a job, and you get to make the [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2639.52s)]
*  judgment with the benefit of hindsight, whether we were just breaking stuff, or whether we were [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2644.56s)]
*  actually doing something in the service of fixing things. I promise you that I believe that we're [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2648.96s)]
*  fixing things, but ultimately the American people will be the judge of that. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2654.16s)]
*  Aaron Powell I'm curious what you made of the vice president's answer, and what that tells us about [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2656.96s)]
*  what the next three and a half years, and maybe even the future of the MAGA movement over a longer [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2664.08s)]
*  time horizon might look like. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2669.12s)]
*  Michael O'Brien I think the vice president's answer reflects a sense that I've heard from [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2670.7999999999997s)]
*  other people associated with the Trump White House, which is you expect your first 100 days to be [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2675.6s)]
*  aggressive, and sometimes chaotic, and sometimes experimental, and you expect to generate a certain [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2683.04s)]
*  kind of backlash if you move fast and try and do big things. And over time, you hope for or expect [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2689.92s)]
*  a kind of stabilization, a stabilization in policy where you figured out how far you can go, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2699.2000000000003s)]
*  what the limits imposed by the Supreme Court and public opinion are, or in the case of trade policy, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2705.6800000000003s)]
*  what the limits imposed by the bond market and the stock market are. You figure out those limits, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2710.96s)]
*  and you sort of settle into a more stable governing style, and voters who were freaked out by the [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2716.7200000000003s)]
*  first 100 days and for various reasons come back to you. And I should say that if you look at the [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2722.8s)]
*  polls right now, that Donald Trump has recovered some ground in the last few weeks as his trade [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2728.7200000000003s)]
*  policy has stabilized, as the Supreme Court has both granted him some victories and also imposed [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2735.44s)]
*  some limits on his policies, as he's sort of pivoted to a kind of diplomatic offensive overseas that [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2741.2000000000003s)]
*  remains to be seen what will come of it. But I think it could be popular, his quest for deals [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2748.7200000000003s)]
*  in the Middle East and so on. So I think you can tell a story like the one the vice president ends [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2754.64s)]
*  with where the Trump administration at day 100 is much less popular than the Trump administration [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2759.04s)]
*  six months or two years from now. But I don't think that's at all guaranteed. And I think obviously [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2768.4s)]
*  there are impulses, strong impulses within the Trump White House to sort of take a breather and [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2774.56s)]
*  then go back to pushing the envelope again. And so much about the future of this administration [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2781.68s)]
*  depends on whether it's capable of sustaining a certain kind of stability and normalcy, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2788.32s)]
*  or whether any period of stabilization will always give way to some new wave of [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2796.4s)]
*  let's see how far we can go. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2801.6800000000003s)]
*  Probably not Moscow, but Mr. Vice President, thank you so much. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2813.84s)]
*  Good to see you, Ross. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2816.64s)]
*  Well, Ross, thank you very much. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2833.3599999999997s)]
*  You're very welcome, Michael. I really appreciate it. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2835.6s)]
*  To hear Ross's entire interview with Vice President Vance, including their conversation [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2837.92s)]
*  about trade and artificial intelligence, listen to the latest episode of Ross's show, Interesting [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2850.2400000000002s)]
*  Times. You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts. We'll be right back. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2856.8s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2883.28s)]
*  Late last night, a gunman shot and killed two staff members of the Israeli embassy in Washington, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2887.2000000000003s)]
*  D.C., outside an event at a Jewish museum. The suspected gunman later chanted, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2893.36s)]
*  free Palestine, while in police custody. In response, Israel's ambassador to the United [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2901.04s)]
*  called the shooting a, quote, depraved act of anti-Semitic terrorism. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2908.96s)]
*  And thank you very much, everyone. It's a great honor to be with the president of [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2917.6s)]
*  South Africa, President Ramaphosa. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2923.7599999999998s)]
*  On Wednesday, what started off as a polite Oval Office meeting between President Trump [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2927.2799999999997s)]
*  and the leader of South Africa became unexpectedly contentious when Trump paused the conversation [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2932.7999999999997s)]
*  to play a video of what he said was evidence of racial persecution of white South Africans. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2940.0s)]
*  Excuse me, turn the lights down. Turn the lights down and just put this on. It's right behind you. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2947.12s)]
*  The video, a compilation of clips, many of them years old, showed South African officials [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2953.68s)]
*  calling for the forceful seizure of land and violence against white farmers. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2960.64s)]
*  Once the video was over, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2980.64s)]
*  South Africa's president tried to correct Trump. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2986.16s)]
*  Of course, what you saw, the speeches that were being made, one, that is not government policy. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2990.64s)]
*  We have a multi-party democracy in South Africa that allows people to express themselves. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=2997.7599999999998s)]
*  Our government policy is completely, completely against what he was saying, even in the parliament. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3004.24s)]
*  But Trump pressed on with his inaccurate claims that South Africa allows black residents [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3013.92s)]
*  to take land from white farmers known as Afrikaners and even to kill them with impunity. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3020.88s)]
*  But you do allow them to take land. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3028.2400000000002s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3031.36s)]
*  You do allow them to take land. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3032.0s)]
*  Nobody can take land. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3033.6800000000003s)]
*  And then when they take the land, they kill the white farmer. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3034.4s)]
*  And when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3037.76s)]
*  No, there is quite... [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3041.04s)]
*  Nothing happens. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHfWeEzmYck&t=3042.7200000000003s)]
