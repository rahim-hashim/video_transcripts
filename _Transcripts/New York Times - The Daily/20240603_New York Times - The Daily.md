# How Trumpâ€™s Conviction Could Reshape the Election
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFzDx81YK2s)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  How the criminal conviction of Donald Trump will shape the remaining months of the presidential
*  race and potentially its outcome.
*  My colleagues Nate Cohn, Maggie Haberman, and Reid Epstein explain.
*  It's Monday, June 3rd.
*  Hello, Nate.
*  Hello Michael.
*  So it's been three days since Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felony charges and now
*  that the dust is starting to settle, it feels like we have to turn to the question of its
*  impact on the election.
*  And you are our resident polling expert at The Times.
*  And so we want you to frame that question with as much data as we possibly can.
*  There's always been a sense that for a lot of voters, a Trump conviction wouldn't change
*  a thing.
*  So whose vote, according to all the polls you conduct and study, might this conviction
*  actually influence?
*  What's that universe?
*  Well, we haven't yet conducted any polls since the conviction.
*  So all of this is strictly theoretical.
*  But before the conviction, even before the trial, we were asking voters what they would
*  do, how they would vote if Donald Trump was convicted of a serious crime.
*  And when we gave voters that hypothetical, a small but still meaningful group of Donald
*  Trump supporters told us that they would then vote for Joe Biden.
*  How small but meaningful.
*  So in our Time Sienna Battleground polls in October, 7% of Donald Trump supporters said
*  they would vote for Joe Biden if Donald Trump was convicted of a felony.
*  Wow.
*  Now, it's just a hypothetical.
*  But 7% is real.
*  7% isn't just real.
*  In our era of close elections, it's easily decisive.
*  The race might not even be close.
*  It's important to emphasize, and I can't emphasize this enough, that asking voters a hypothetical
*  is not a realistic simulation of what will actually happen now.
*  They didn't even know what trial it was about.
*  We just put in their face, he's guilty now what?
*  That's not the way it's going to work in the real world.
*  But it shows that a meaningful sliver of Trump supporters are uncomfortable with the idea
*  of voting for Trump once he's been convicted of a felony.
*  And moreover, they were even willing to say they support or would support Joe Biden.
*  They said to the pollster, Joe Biden.
*  That's a real line for a Trump voter to cross.
*  I'm hearing you say that this could, could, could, could conditional be a game changer.
*  Look, I'm not a strategist.
*  But the fact that there's this sliver of voters who are repelled by the idea of Donald Trump
*  as a convict means that now that he is a convicted felon, how the Biden campaign and the Trump
*  campaign handle this issue, how they talk about this conviction, how they try and exploit
*  it could easily be decisive in a close election this November.
*  You ready to go, Maggie?
*  I'm ready to go.
*  OK.
*  So Maggie, from what Nate Cohn just told us?
*  The election could theoretically hinge on how both candidates decide to talk about and
*  campaign around this criminal conviction of Trump.
*  So as a longtime student and observer of Donald Trump, take us into his emerging strategy
*  for how to approach and if possible capitalize on this conviction.
*  So let's just start with how he's feeling about this, which is quite angry.
*  We know that this verdict, according to several people who have spoken to him, has infuriated
*  him.
*  This is clearly not the outcome he wanted.
*  Nobody wants to be convicted of a crime.
*  And if you think about it, Trump has lived in a legal gray area for decades.
*  But prior to the last 16 months or so, he had never been charged with a crime.
*  And even though privately he had told people from the outset he expected he would get convicted,
*  he is a big believer in his own luck and he had really hoped that his winning streak would
*  continue.
*  And it did not.
*  It did not.
*  So this is really hard for him to stomach and to process, frankly.
*  But even before the verdict, it was clear what he was going to do and how he was going
*  to try to spin a guilty verdict.
*  So from the moment he walked out of the courtroom and into the courthouse hallway where he
*  talked to reporters there.
*  This was a disgrace.
*  This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt.
*  We saw what has become his standard playbook emerge from his genuine fury here.
*  Our whole country is being rigged right now.
*  This was done by the Biden administration.
*  And that was to characterize this outcome as the inevitable culmination of a years-long
*  partisan campaign to weaponize the legal system against him.
*  And we'll keep fighting.
*  We'll fight till the end and we'll win because our country's gone to hell.
*  And his message is, fight against this corrupt system.
*  And by fight against it, his message to voters is, elect me again.
*  And this message takes lots of forms.
*  The first is a series of fundraising pitches that are coming fast and furiously.
*  I just want to read you a few of them, Michael.
*  I am a political prisoner.
*  Never surrender.
*  I was convicted in a rigged political witch hunt trial.
*  I did nothing wrong.
*  Thank you very much, everybody.
*  And after these fundraising pitches had accelerated after the verdict...
*  As far as the trial itself, it was very unfair.
*  He held this, not really a press conference, but gave a statement.
*  You saw what happened to some of the witnesses that were on our side.
*  They were literally crucified by this man who looks like an angel, but he's really a devil.
*  He looks so nice and soft.
*  He made a long statement on Friday morning at Trump Tower where he tried to essentially
*  relitigate the case and cast it in his own way.
*  Legal expense was marked down as legal expense.
*  Think of it.
*  This is the crime that I committed, that I'm supposed to go to jail for 187 years for.
*  And say things that were not true, such as that he faces 187 years in prison.
*  But this is far beyond me.
*  This is bigger than Trump.
*  This is bigger than me.
*  This is bigger than my presidency.
*  And I can fix this system that's corrupt.
*  And you can trust me to take care of it.
*  November 5th.
*  Remember November 5th is the most important day in the history of our country.
*  Thank you very much, everybody.
*  So Trump's plan is quite clearly not in any way so far to avoid talking about what for
*  would be legal stain on your record, but to talk about it a lot.
*  I mean, he's holding a news conference explicitly to talk about it.
*  He's sending out all these fundraising messages referring to it.
*  And he's going to lean into it in those communications to basically say, that thing I always warned
*  you was happening to me and could happen to me, that the other side would use the legal
*  system against me.
*  It's finally happened.
*  And the only way that we can overcome this is if you make me president and I become the
*  guy sitting atop the entire legal system and I can fix it from the inside.
*  That's basically the message.
*  Yes.
*  And that has consistently been his message, Michael.
*  We saw Trump run previously on the idea of quote, I alone can fix it.
*  And that really is what he's saying here.
*  He is saying that the only credible law enforcement is me.
*  That all of these efforts to investigate me are tainted.
*  They're political, they're politicized, and you can fix this by electing me.
*  So how should we be thinking about whether this familiar framework kind of on steroids
*  now that Trump has actually been convicted is working?
*  I know it's early.
*  It's basically 72 hours since his conviction.
*  But because he's been so present in presenting this version of events, I wonder how we gauge
*  if it's any kind of a success.
*  We do have one pretty powerful barometer, which is his fundraising.
*  He raised an astonishing amount of money in a very short amount of time.
*  Shortly after the conviction was announced, the websites where he's asking people to donate
*  crashed from so much traffic.
*  And yet he still managed to raise more than $50 million in less than 36 hours.
*  I mean, that is a little bit hard to wrap your head around.
*  That's well, my math isn't that great, but it's well more than a million dollars an hour.
*  Right.
*  And look, we can't corroborate those numbers until we see the FEC reports.
*  I think it's important to note that.
*  But by all accounts, they've raised a ton of money.
*  Right.
*  And we've talked to our colleagues about Trump's fundraising disadvantage vis-a-vis Joe Biden,
*  which is pretty meaningful.
*  It sounds like, of all things, a conviction, a criminal conviction has done more to catch
*  him up to Biden than almost anything else in this campaign.
*  That's exactly right.
*  There is a very real possibility that he will, if not erase the gap, significantly close
*  the gap that Biden has over him with fundraising in the coming weeks.
*  But I have to say that so far, what you're describing is feeling like a direct appeal
*  to the base, the faithful, to those who are primed to love Trump and to see the world
*  as he does, a legal system rigged against him.
*  It feels less like a strategy for reaching out to the, you know, 7% or so of voters who,
*  as Nate told us earlier, have told pollsters that a conviction might send them from Trump
*  to Biden.
*  So how should we think about that?
*  It's a really good question, Michael.
*  I think that his advisors would rather that he doesn't spend so much time relitigating
*  the trial details, right?
*  They let Stormy Daniels testify.
*  They let this happen.
*  They let that happen.
*  His strategists are okay with him putting forward a message about how I'm here fighting
*  for a system that is being perverted in his telling.
*  And his advisors think there are enough people, even in the middle, who are troubled by the
*  relative frivolous case here compared to the much weightier ones of January 6th and the
*  classified documents case, that they think that that could have some appeal.
*  But the problem is they can't control how Trump is going to talk about this.
*  They can try.
*  And so the question becomes, can he deliver a focused enough message that could appeal
*  to people who worry about how this case came about?
*  Is it a contortion of the law?
*  And who might be open to that message in the fall?
*  And meantime, from what I'm seeing, Maggie, it seems like everyone in the Republican Party
*  seems to be taking their cues from Trump and really going all in on this strategy of trying
*  to use this conviction to win over voters.
*  Well, they don't even need much of a cue to take, Michael.
*  They already know what Trump wants them to say.
*  But yes, I mean, everybody is pushing it front and center.
*  The court system is weaponized.
*  It is used to go after political opponents and people who work for them.
*  I woke up heartbroken for our country because the precedent set is that if you don't like
*  somebody's politics, you should use the American system of law in order to try and destroy them.
*  You're seeing Marco Rubio and JD Vance, who are two top vice presidential picks, talking
*  about the verdict and talking about it in very derisive terms and what it might mean
*  for the future.
*  The entire argument of this case is that Donald Trump should go to prison because an employee
*  of his filled out paperwork the wrong way.
*  This is disgraceful.
*  Do you believe that?
*  And you're seeing governors talk about it.
*  You're seeing local lawmakers talking about it.
*  You're seeing the House speaker talk about it.
*  You are seeing everybody talk about it.
*  He is the leader of the Republican Party, and instead of cleaving them away from him,
*  it's moving them closer.
*  And he has just tightened his grip.
*  Whether that is something durable in a general election where most voters are going to vote
*  about how candidates impact their own lives and how policies impact their own lives, we
*  just don't know.
*  But they are very much putting this front and center for the time being.
*  I want to talk about that for just a minute because we've long understood that Republican
*  officials at very high levels are willing to mimic whatever Trump is saying after the
*  The Access Hollywood video, for example, in 2016 during the impeachment.
*  But this feels different.
*  We're now seeing members of the United States Senate, for example, Vance and Rubio, embracing
*  a message of outright lawlessness.
*  This is supposedly the party of law and order.
*  So it's surprising not just to see them embracing a convicted felon in Donald Trump, but embracing
*  him at the very moment when he is saying to the world, this is stupid, this is rigged,
*  this doesn't make any sense.
*  I just don't think we've ever really seen that before in American politics.
*  Michael, I'm going to go ahead and disagree a bit with your premise.
*  I don't think there's anything surprising about this because Donald Trump has so thoroughly
*  remade the Republican Party where what he wants it to be is what everyone does.
*  And we have seen this over the course of many, many years.
*  So what he's asking of these people is no different than what he asked of them during
*  the first impeachment or the second impeachment or when he was indicted in this case.
*  It is defend me, defend me, defend me.
*  And there is no exception made now that he has actually been convicted because Republicans
*  don't believe this was a legitimate trial.
*  So this is not an intellectually hard leap for them to make.
*  He has over the years remade the Republican Party, this party of law and order into the
*  party of when it comes to the law, whatever Donald Trump says.
*  Correct.
*  Instead of it once upon a time being the party of law and order where this kind of conduct
*  would be shunned, where say when Richard Nixon was in office and convinced to leave because
*  of what he was facing in terms of possibly being ousted and not putting his party through
*  that, Donald Trump is going to put his party through that every single time and they will
*  happily go through it with him at this point.
*  Well, to that point, there are, it would seem, two possibilities for how this all plays out.
*  One is that Trump's conviction strategy, what we've been talking about here, it works because
*  he hasn't just remade the Republican Party in his image.
*  He's remade the entire country's expectations about what a president can or can't be.
*  The other possibility is that this approach is just wrong.
*  And while Republicans are going to line up behind Trump because of it, average Americans,
*  swing voters especially, won't.
*  And this will end up just recreating the Republican Party's problems from the last election, the
*  2022 midterms, when Trump's renegade outlaw approach, his insistence that the election
*  was stolen, his defense of riots at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, ended up costing the
*  Republican Party so many congressional elections.
*  That could be happening because of Trump's message right now all over again in this presidential
*  race.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Because again, we just don't know which way this is going to play.
*  So much of this is going to depend on how a narrow group of voters view this in a handful
*  of states.
*  And if there are enough people who can be persuaded by him that this really was an unfair
*  thing that happened to him, and evidence of a corrupted and corroded system, then maybe
*  it will work.
*  But if all Trump does is keep reminding people that he has engaged in conduct that other
*  presidents have not, that could be a problem for him.
*  Right.
*  Some of this depends, Michael, on what Democrats decide to do broadly.
*  And we just don't know the answer to that yet.
*  Democrats so far are very clearly conflicted about how to handle this.
*  Donald Trump is not conflicted at all.
*  Well, Maggie, thank you very much.
*  Michael, thank you.
*  After the break, my colleague, Reid Epstein, takes us inside that democratic conflict.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Reid, you cover the Biden campaign for the Times.
*  We just talked to Maggie about how Donald Trump is trying to turn this negative, a conviction,
*  into a positive by basically deciding to talk about it nonstop, which is a risky strategy.
*  In theory, Democrats have a simpler task here, which is to figure out what to do with a kind
*  of political gift, their opponent leading in the polls, having been convicted of 34
*  crimes.
*  But Maggie's final words to us were that Democrats were conflicted about how to handle
*  this, suggesting that it is more complicated than it may seem.
*  So my question to you is, is it and should it be complicated?
*  Well, it usually is a good thing when your opponent is convicted of felonies during a
*  campaign, that in the campaign handbook, that is generally seen as a plus.
*  However, we are living in the year 2024.
*  President Biden is running for reelection and he has a very complicated relationship
*  with Donald Trump's legal problems.
*  He has from the beginning vowed to not discuss them.
*  He has essentially ordered the White House and his campaign staff to stay away from any
*  discussions of what the indictments would mean for his own political future and the
*  presidential campaign.
*  And why would that be?
*  He does not want to be seen as pulling the strings or the man responsible for Trump being
*  indicted. When he ran for president in 2020, you may remember he ran on a
*  return to normal.
*  And one of the tenets of that was an independent Justice Department that would make decisions
*  without influence from the White House.
*  But, Reed, importantly, this case that we're talking about and this conviction is not a
*  federal case. It is a local Manhattan criminal prosecution that has resulted in a
*  conviction. So what has Biden's relationship been to that?
*  Has that decree of don't talk about Trump's legal problems because I am president and
*  I oversee the Department of Justice, has that applied to this case?
*  It has for the most part held in this case.
*  The Biden campaign has had a couple of sort of jokey asides referencing the Manhattan
*  case. If you remember when they made their offer to have a debate, Biden said that he
*  would do it on Wednesdays because that was when Trump was free from the trial.
*  But for the most part, Biden has stayed pretty mute about the whole thing.
*  And then on Thursday afternoon, when the verdict came in, everyone in the universe that I
*  report about was anxious and ready to see if it would change the Biden campaign's
*  posture toward Donald Trump's legal issues.
*  And what we learned in the minutes after the verdict was delivered was that they were
*  staying the course, essentially, that they issued a press release that said essentially the
*  only way to keep Donald Trump out of the White House is at the ballot box.
*  And the next day, Biden himself gives a press conference at the White House.
*  Good afternoon. Before I begin my remarks, I just want to say a few words about what
*  happened yesterday in New York City.
*  He spoke about Trump's verdict, the jury, the judicial process.
*  The jury heard five weeks of evidence, five weeks.
*  And after careful deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous verdict.
*  They found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts.
*  And as far as Trump himself, Biden is pretty restrained.
*  And it's reckless. It's dangerous.
*  It's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the
*  verdict.
*  He talks about how reckless it is for anybody to cast doubt upon the judicial system
*  and the process through which Trump was convicted.
*  But he doesn't get into the specifics of Trump's case, nor does he dwell on Trump's
*  new status as a convicted felon.
*  The justice system should be respected and we should never allow anyone to tear it down.
*  In all told, he was done talking about Trump's case in a little less than two minutes.
*  This feels like a moment to pause on for just a moment, because at the precise time that
*  Trump becomes a convicted felon 34 times over and he is blasting out fundraising emails
*  and saying, I'm a political prisoner, the Biden campaign, which is behind in the polls
*  and is suddenly presented with, in theory, an opportunity to genuinely shake up this
*  race. Those are rare opportunities in a campaign like this.
*  The Biden campaign barely touches it.
*  They did not go in on it full bore the way that if the positions were reversed, you
*  would expect Republicans to attack Biden on.
*  Right. If we don't need to imagine what that would look like, all you have to do is look
*  at how they have responded and reacted to the president's son, Hunter Biden, being
*  indicted on criminal charges himself.
*  They have attacked Hunter Biden.
*  They have suggested that his alleged crimes are the responsibility of his father.
*  They have branded them both part of a Biden crime family.
*  And all this comes as Hunter Biden is scheduled to begin his own trial on Monday, making
*  it all but certain that Republicans will continue to use that trial as fodder to attack
*  President Biden and other Democrats.
*  We'd I wonder what the rest of the Democratic Party is thinking and saying about this very
*  restrained Biden approach to Trump's conviction.
*  Well, the minute the verdict came in, my colleague, Nick Nahamas, and I began calling
*  all manner of Democrats, senators, congressmen, state party chairs, strategists, on and on
*  and what we heard from in the end was a party that really was ready to go on the attack.
*  We heard from Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who said the
*  contrast in the campaign needs to be between a man of lies and chaos versus a guy who's
*  trying to make the country work for everyone.
*  We heard from Beto O'Rourke, the Texas Democrat who ran for president against Biden,
*  who said it's the obligation of every Democrat to remind every voter that Donald Trump is
*  now a convicted felon and just how unprecedented this is.
*  We heard from members of Congress.
*  We heard from state legislators.
*  We heard from county and state party chairs.
*  And there is essentially no one who thinks that it shouldn't be part of the push that
*  the party at large is making in terms of telling voters about Donald Trump, that they want
*  the words convicted felon to be included in every sentence that has the word Donald Trump in it.
*  This sounds like leading Democrats saying to Biden, do more, lean into this moment,
*  play with this conviction.
*  Right. And the reason they want that is that this conviction has the potential to reach
*  the sort of voters who are not paying attention to the news.
*  We know that Joe Biden is weakest among people who don't read newspapers, who don't follow
*  television news.
*  And these are the sort of people who won't pay attention to some speech that Biden gives
*  on a policy topic, but they're going to hear that Trump was convicted.
*  And Democrats think it's important to make sure that that gets baked in to how people
*  feel about Donald Trump.
*  Especially people who consume very little news.
*  I mean, all of that seems to potentially point to the idea that President Biden in this moment,
*  being as conflicted as he is about how to handle this conviction.
*  And as a result, being subtle and not figuring out how to really push on it might be squandering
*  his last real opportunity to fundamentally change a race that according to almost all
*  the major polls, he's behind in and is in real danger of losing.
*  It may be too soon to say that he's squandering this because Trump was convicted on Thursday.
*  He's still convicted today.
*  He'll be convicted next week.
*  And so they have not foreclosed on the idea that they will not lean into this.
*  They just aren't doing it right now.
*  But they are running shorter on time every day to make up that ground that you talked about.
*  Trailing in the polls.
*  And so it's too soon to say that they're squandering this particular opportunity.
*  But it's not too soon to say that they've spent a lot of time
*  not making up ground against Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  And at the moment, it sure looks like the candidate in the lead in this race
*  and with the most in theory to lose from this conviction has the most robust plan
*  for trying to capitalize it.
*  And that's Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who would seem to have the most to gain from this conviction
*  seems very inclined to underplay it, be subtle about it, not make it a centerpiece of his candidacy.
*  And that's genuinely, I think for a lot of people going to be surprising.
*  Well, there may be one other way to think about this.
*  And that's that the Biden campaign thinks that they're playing this just the right way.
*  Every day that Donald Trump talks about how unfair the conviction was and how unfair the trial was,
*  Joe Biden's campaign thinks that that's helpful for them
*  because Donald Trump is not talking about inflation or the border
*  or issues that are acutely bad for Joe Biden to have at the center of the nation's political
*  discussion.
*  And so Joe Biden and his campaign are happy to have Trump do 30 minute press conferences
*  where he rants and raves about the judge and the trial and the rules and the jury instruction and
*  all those things that they think make this campaign about Trump himself and not about
*  him saying things to some of these infrequent and low information voters
*  that the Biden campaign thinks will decide the election.
*  If those people were hearing Trump talk about inflation and the border
*  and how Joe Biden has not performed well on those two issues, I think
*  the Biden campaign would be much more worried than if Trump is talking about the trial.
*  Right. You're saying there's a world where the Biden campaign sees Trump's strategy of
*  talking about this case nonstop as helping not necessarily him, but them.
*  But them. If Trump was convicted and said, that's over, I'm going to talk about the border
*  and the economy, I think the Biden people would be a lot more worried.
*  We'll read. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In a detailed speech on Friday, President Biden
*  endorsed a plan to end the war in Gaza that would lead to a permanent ceasefire,
*  the phased release of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the withdrawal of all Israeli
*  troops from Gaza. The speech was an attempt by Biden to pressure Israel's leader, Benjamin
*  Netanyahu, into accepting the proposal. But two members of Netanyahu's far-right coalition
*  immediately rejected the plan, threatening to quit his government if he accepts it.
*  And Netanyahu himself expressed reservations, saying that Israel had not yet completed the job
*  of destroying Hamas. And the African National Congress, the party that freed South Africa from
*  apartheid and has held power there since 1994, has lost its political monopoly over the country.
*  In the latest election, the party received only 40% of the vote, far less than it got in the last
*  election. Analysts said that high unemployment, shortages of electricity, and rampant crime
*  cost the ANC its once unbreakable support. To stay in power, the party must now cobble together
*  a coalition government with its rivals. Today's episode was produced by Rachel Cuester,
