# Harris Takes the Lead in Key States
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN4nSR4k0rA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  A major new poll from the Times finds that Vice President Kamala Harris has transformed
*  the 2024 presidential race and is now leading President Trump in three of the most crucial
*  battleground states.
*  Today, my colleague Nate Cohn explains why Harris is benefiting so much from being a
*  new face in an election that so many Americans had dreaded.
*  It's Tuesday, August 13th.
*  Nate, the Times has just completed our first poll that seeks to understand the state of
*  this presidential race since Biden dropped out and Kamala Harris took his place as the
*  Democratic nominee.
*  Everyone understands that that has changed this race, but this poll attempted to measure
*  by just how much it changed the race in three of the most essential swing states.
*  So tell us about the results.
*  Well, we found that the entry of Kamala Harris into the race has fundamentally upended this
*  contest.
*  We pulled Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, arguably the three most important battleground
*  states. These are three states that voted for Obama in 2012, Trump in 2016, and then
*  flipped back to Biden in 2020.
*  But that Trump had generally been leading in the polling so far this cycle.
*  And if Kamala Harris won all three states, she would almost certainly win the presidential
*  election. And the poll found Harris leading Donald Trump in all three states by a four
*  point margin, 50 to 46 percent.
*  A huge swing in favor of the Democrats in a very short period of time.
*  Basically, what this poll found was that she was a game changer in those three states.
*  That's right. And it is worth saying it's all on the Harris side of things.
*  Donald Trump's ratings are essentially unchanged since the last time he pulled these
*  states. In fact, his favorability rating ticked up a little bit.
*  Wow.
*  But by replacing Joe Biden, who was really unpopular, with Kamala Harris, who in this poll
*  is viewed favorably by 49 or 50 percent of voters in every state, they have completely
*  changed what had been the basic dynamic of this election.
*  Until now, voters had been agonizing between two candidates they didn't like.
*  And we don't know what would have happened if we had played the Biden-Trump match up
*  to the end. But we do know that as of July, when voters were choosing between those two
*  unpalatable options, more of them were choosing Trump. Now they don't have to. At least for
*  now, they like Harris more than they like Trump. And so she has the lead.
*  So let's talk about who has rallied around Harris once Biden got out of the race and
*  how that helps explain why she's suddenly in the lead in these three states.
*  Harris's biggest gains are coming from the demographic groups that traditionally vote
*  Democratic, but that Joe Biden had struggled to consolidate throughout much of the year.
*  Take black voters. The poll finds her up 81 to 13 among black voters across these three
*  states. That's a lot better than Biden had been in polls this year. We had done some
*  polls that found Joe Biden in the 60s among black voters at times.
*  It feels really important to me because black voters are a group that helped power Biden
*  to victory in 2020 in states like Georgia. It's a group of voters that Trump has been
*  very heavily focused on and one of the groups that appeared most open to defecting from
*  the Democratic side to the Republican side because of Trump. So those kinds of gains
*  feel very meaningful.
*  That's right. And another group that sort of has those same characteristics as young
*  voters. The poll found Harris ahead by 15 points among 18 to 29 year olds in these three
*  states. It's not the best number of Democrats that ever produced among young voters to be
*  frank, but it's a lot better than Joe Biden for much of the year. And these are two groups
*  where it's easy to see why she would do a little bit better than Joe Biden. She's much
*  younger than he is. She's black. He's white. She's also a woman and it's worth noting that
*  among women than Joe Biden had been doing in our previous surveys. What's maybe more
*  surprising though is she's still at least holding her own among older voters, among
*  men, among white voters. She's not doing better than Biden was in these polls, but she's not
*  doing worse. So she's adding a lot of strength among traditionally Democratic constituencies
*  without giving up much if any ground among the groups that you might expect to be relative
*  weak points for her. You said that a lot of this seemingly across the board improvement in
*  the numbers for Harris seems to be driven by the fact that both Trump and Biden are not
*  especially popular candidates. And of course, now Biden's out of the race. So I guess my
*  question is how much are Harris's gains reflective, not just of Biden or Trump's problems,
*  but of her own popularity? It's definitely a reflection of her own popularity and standing
*  on every question that we asked. People say that they like Harris. They say she's
*  intelligent. They say she's honest. They say she cares about you. I think the more interesting
*  question is why? I mean, just as recently as a few weeks ago, a majority of Americans said they
*  had an unfavorable view of Kamala Harris. Right. They even came on the show and we talked about
*  all of her different political liabilities and challenges and how bad her 2019 campaign was.
*  We did. And now all of a sudden, Kamala Harris is broadly liked and popular. And it's happened
*  extremely quickly. And I think that there are really a mix of two basic reasons that this can
*  happen. One is that she's really changed people's views about them because she's made this brand new
*  impression with the help of great media coverage, or she's benefiting from this new contrast,
*  this comparison with Joe Biden and the burst of pent up democratic energy from people who have
*  been yearning for something different. I think it's probably a little bit of both. I mean,
*  I was just explained to a friend recently that it's sort of like the country just had a breakup
*  with Joe Biden. And they've been in this relationship for years that they weren't happy with. And maybe
*  they didn't even know how unhappy they were with this relationship. But now that they've had this
*  breakup, they're newly liberated. There's this incredible sense of new opportunity and now comes
*  along Kamala Harris. And after their first few dates with Kamala, the country is thrilled.
*  This is quite a metaphor. And to indulge it a little bit further, when such a date between
*  Americans and Kamala Harris was hypothetical, because she wasn't the nominee when she was just
*  vice president, voters views of her were less generous. But once this breakup with Biden
*  happens, all that pent up desire for change, that feeling of liberation you just mentioned,
*  it overwhelms any previous doubts a lot of voters had about her.
*  Right. And we'll find out whether this is real and whether the country is going to marry her in
*  a few months. But for the moment, I think that Harris is enjoying this really coveted place
*  in American politics, where voters are able to invest most of their hopes and their wishes for
*  what they want to see in a candidate in this new figure. In polling, it's a little bit like
*  something called a generic candidate or a generic Democrat. Can you just explain that?
*  Yeah, it might sound a little insulting to compare Kamala Harris to a generic Democrat,
*  but it's really not. In a poll, a pollster might ask, would you rather vote for the Democrat or
*  Donald Trump? The Democrat is unnamed, not a real person. And the unnamed generic candidate,
*  and this is true for both parties, almost always fares better than a named candidate.
*  And that's because they're not burdened with all of the real world imperfections that
*  actual real candidates have. And I think that's sort of what's happened for Kamala Harris over
*  the last few weeks, is she's running as a broadly appealing mainstream Democratic candidate. And
*  there are a bunch of good feelings around her, and she hasn't really been defined either way.
*  And so voters are piling their hopes to support someone other than Donald Trump
*  into their idea of her right now, and it's giving her a clear lead.
*  So we should think of Kamala Harris, especially in the context of a very short election in which
*  she's suddenly the surprise replacement Democratic nominee, as basically the platonic ideal of a
*  Democrat in this moment, who almost in a real sense does occupy that spot you just described
*  of the generic Democrat. It's an unusual position. And even though the word generic might sound bad,
*  sounds like a pretty ideal one. It is and that's how she's been running her campaign for the last
*  few weeks. Oh, it's so good to be back. Good evening. And you can see that if you watch her
*  stump speech across our nation, we are witnessing a full on assault on hard fought, hard won
*  freedoms and rights. She really sounds like a pretty typical mainstream boilerplate Democrat.
*  And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government
*  telling her what to do. She talks about abortion. She talks about building up the middle class.
*  A future with affordable health care, affordable child care and paid leave.
*  She talks about how we need to go into the future. We're not going to go back. She talks about
*  freedom. And we're not going back because Nevada, we fight for the future.
*  Some of the stuff is linked to her biography, right? That she's a prosecutor, but most of what
*  she says could be said by just about any Democrat. So Georgia, today I ask you, Nevada, today I ask
*  you. So Arizona, I ask, are you ready to make your voices heard? And when we fight, and when we fight,
*  and when we fight, we win. And you know what? It's a plausibly winning strategy to just be a broadly
*  acceptable mainstream Democratic candidate. I suspect there are going to be some listeners,
*  some Democrats and non Democrats who listen to this conversation and say, how can you call
*  Kamala Harris generic? She's the first black South Asian woman major party nominee. Yeah,
*  I think it's a fair point in a lot of respects. Kamala Harris is not a generic Democrat, but that
*  may be part of the reason why it makes sense for her to run as a relatively mainstream Democrat.
*  She's already distinctive to millions of Americans. She's going to look really different from Joe Biden
*  and Donald Trump and the other people who have dominated our politics for the last eight years.
*  And so already being so distinct, I think that gives her all the more incentive to run as a
*  very mainstream and typical Democrat. If there's any risk for Harris, it's that if she doesn't
*  define herself as anything in particular, the Donald Trump campaign will define her instead.
*  There's no way that Kamala Harris will be a generic candidate come November, right? People are going
*  to know who Kamala Harris is. And if they do, then she won't be a generic Democrat anymore. She will
*  be a named candidate with all the same liabilities as every other Democrat. And that might be a much
*  more difficult challenge for her in November. We'll be right back.
*  Nate, I'm curious based on this poll, what a not generic or much less generic version of a
*  Harris candidacy is likely to look like over the next 80 or so days of this campaign, either in her
*  hands or in the hands of Donald Trump. Well, I think it's hard to say what it would look like
*  in her hands. After all, she's a blank slate. She could define herself however she wants. I think
*  it's worth noting that she didn't choose to define herself as a moderate by selecting someone like
*  Josh Shapiro as her vice president. But that doesn't mean that she's not going to move to the
*  center at some point. It doesn't mean she might not stake out bold progressive positions later. I think
*  either way, whatever she chooses to do, the Democratic convention is clearly her opportunity
*  to define herself more clearly in the eyes of the public. However, that may be in Trump's hands. I
*  think it's pretty easy to see the kinds of directions they might go. They're either going
*  to define her as too far to the left or if they think they can't do that because she succeeded in
*  positioning herself in the center, they're going to say she's a phony flip-flopper. And if they do
*  choose to go after her on the issues, the poll suggests that there are some opportunities for
*  them. The poll says that voters trust Trump more than Harris on the economy and on immigration,
*  two issues where Trump has had an advantage for a long time and that rank really highly in the minds
*  of the public. And also she's where Harris has some vulnerabilities, like when she took a role
*  on immigration early in her tenure as vice president. And the poll also shows that 44%
*  of voters think Harris is too liberal or too progressive. Now, it's not a majority, but it
*  does suggest that this starts out as an area of relative vulnerability for her that the Trump
*  campaign can try and reinforce as the race gets underway. But you know what, it's worth stepping
*  back and just noting they haven't successfully focused on any of these things over the last
*  three weeks. And we can go through all the different themes that the Trump campaign has
*  tried to work through that Donald Trump himself has worked through, but they've been scattershot
*  at best and a lot of them are off topic, like is Kamala Harris black or is she Indian?
*  Right. This was in fact, the focus of Monday's episode of our show. Jonathan Swan was walking
*  through the kind of failures of the Trump campaign to come up with any coherent strategy for
*  challenging Kamala Harris's rise. And I guess the way you would interpret that is that he has failed
*  to make her less generic. Yeah, absolutely. He has passed on the opportunity to define Harris
*  when the public's views of her were most malleable. I mean, when I think back about the biggest
*  things that they've managed to talk about, I think more about what they've said about Tim Walz,
*  not about Kamala Harris. You remember that day when the stock market fell and they talked about
*  Kamala crash or whatever. Right. You know, there was that, but her being too far to the left, her
*  positions on immigration or the economy, that hasn't broken through. And they can still try,
*  but they've clearly made it much more challenging for themselves. Nate, former President Trump never
*  really struggled to negatively define Joe Biden. Do we suspect it's only a matter of time before he
*  lands on a somewhat effective approach to Kamala Harris? You know, I don't think it's inevitable
*  that Trump will land on an effective approach here. And I would actually push back a little bit on the
*  idea that Trump found easy to define Joe Biden. In 2020, Trump largely failed to define Joe Biden
*  in a negative light. That's a big part of why Joe Biden managed to win. The public independently
*  reached the view that Joe Biden was too old to be president and was an ineffective president in
*  this campaign. Donald Trump didn't need to do anything in order for the public to reach
*  that conclusion. And our polling showed that years ahead of where we are today. And similarly in 2016,
*  I mean, Donald Trump undoubtedly attacked Hillary Clinton, but there again, was it really Donald
*  Trump succeeding at characterizing Hillary Clinton as being corrupt or a candidate of the elite in
*  the establishment? Or was that something that was already in place at the time Donald Trump ran?
*  I would argue that that was already mostly in place and that Donald Trump wasn't responsible for
*  that. Kamala Harris, it's worth noting, doesn't have those kind of obvious built-in liabilities.
*  Hmm. Just explain that.
*  Well, she's not too old to be president. She's 59, right? She doesn't start the campaign with
*  an FBI investigation or 20 years of personal baggage. And it's worth noting that although
*  the Trump campaign does have some material to work with in terms of some previous left views
*  on the issues, there's very little so far in the way of negative stories about her personally,
*  like the sort of deep character problems that large portions of the public believed about
*  Hillary Clinton in 2016 or about Joe Biden's capacity to be president today. Kamala Harris
*  doesn't have those kind of liabilities right now. And I think it's really important. A lot of Americans,
*  they don't just vote on the issues. They care about character. They make judgments about
*  whether they think someone is a good person or a bad person. They're drawn to the vibes, as they
*  say. And a lot of those things are being driven by factors other than whether Kamala Harris flip
*  flopped on fracking. They're driven by these more basic traits about the candidates. And it could be
*  a serious problem for Donald Trump that there isn't a character or trait based dimension
*  to the major attack against Kamala Harris. What that tells me, and I'm curious what you think
*  about this, is that Harris has really benefited from being a pretty low profile vice president
*  under Biden. Even with the favorability problems she had as VP, they weren't deeply grounded in
*  much exposure to the public. And on top of that, she's then tossed into this presidential race at
*  the very last minute without a long campaign to define her. And I think a lot of people wondered
*  was that going to be a disadvantage for her, make it really impossible for her to mount a serious
*  campaign in such a short period of time. And it's turning out to be, all of it, an advantage.
*  Matthew Sosnowski Absolutely. I mean, as soon as she got into the race and as soon as Democrats
*  decided that they were going to get behind her and move past Joe Biden, this tidal wave of enthusiasm
*  has swept her up. And it's been enough to completely change the public's view of her.
*  Now, I think it is worth cautioning, of course, that if the public's views of her can change
*  greatly in three weeks, they could change back the other way. I don't think we should be sure that
*  the public's view of her now is somehow set in stone. I think that the overarching lesson here
*  is that this is a candidate who's still in the early phases of being defined. But to this point,
*  it couldn't have gone too much better for her.
*  Aaron Powell And I'm curious, should we assume that if Kamala Harris is now leading Trump in
*  the three swing states that this poll covered, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, that she might
*  be leading Trump as well in the key swing states in the Sun Belt that the Times hasn't yet pulled
*  since she became the nominee? And I'm thinking about states like Arizona, Nevada, Georgia,
*  North Carolina.
*  Yeah, it's entirely possible. Now, Joe Biden was trailing Donald Trump by a lot in those Sun Belt
*  states because he was so weak among young and non-white voters. But those are exactly the
*  groups that the poll shows Kamala Harris is making her biggest gains. So it seems entirely
*  possible that she's made disproportionate gains in those Sun Belt states. Whether that's enough
*  for her to lead versus it just being a dead heat or slightly behind, I don't know. But I would expect
*  the race in those states to be very close if she has any discernible advantage in the
*  northern battlegrounds.
*  Aaron Powell Right. And it kind of feels that what this poll tells us is that there has been
*  a transformation of this race and that where Trump was once winning, he's at the very least now in a
*  very competitive toss up race for president. Is that how you see it?
*  That's basically how I view it. And if anything, Harris has an edge in the polling today.
*  Whether that'll last until November is obviously a completely different question. But to the extent
*  the Trump campaign had crafted strategy around trying to defeat Joe Biden among young voters and
*  black voters, and by capitalizing on a deep dissatisfaction with a candidate who seemed incapable
*  of winning the presidency, that strategy is now out the window. They have a completely different
*  race against a candidate who right now is pretty popular with voters who represents change in her
*  own right, and who now has the lead in the most important battleground states. So this is
*  absolutely a winnable race for Democrats now. And it's a completely different picture than the one
*  we had a month ago.
*  Well, Nate, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. The independent presidential campaign of Robert F.
*  Kennedy Jr. was dealt a major blow on Monday, when a judge ruled that his petition to get on
*  the ballot was invalid because Kennedy had used a sham address to maintain his New York residency.
*  If it stands, the ruling would kick Kennedy off New York's ballot and could endanger his efforts
*  to get on the ballot in all 50 states. Kennedy has vowed to appeal the ruling. And after an
*  audacious incursion into Russian territory, Ukraine's army now claims to control two dozen
*  communities there covering nearly 400 square miles. The incursion is an embarrassing setback
*  for Russia that could benefit Ukraine in two ways. First, by drawing Russian forces away from
*  Ukraine. And second, by serving as a bargaining chip for Ukraine in future peace negotiations
*  with Russia. Today's episode was produced by Shannon Lin, Carlos Prieto and Claire Tennesqueter.
