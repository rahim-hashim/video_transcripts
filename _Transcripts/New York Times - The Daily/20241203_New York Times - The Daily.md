# When the President Pardons His Son
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7xkmctC_0w)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, why President Biden went back on his word to pardon his own son, and where that
*  decision leaves the U.S. system of justice.
*  Chief White House correspondent, Peter Baker, is our guest.
*  It's Tuesday, December 3rd.
*  Peter, we are reaching you in, of all places, Angola, where you are traveling with President
*  Biden.
*  It's pretty late there for you.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah, Air Force One just landed here in Luanda, the capital, and he got off the plane for
*  the start of a couple day visit here.
*  Didn't talk with the reporters on the plane or those on the ground about anything going
*  on back home, but obviously that's top of mind for a lot of people.
*  Right.
*  It seems impossible to imagine that the subject of what he did before he left for Angola is
*  not very much chasing him there.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I think it's one of these foreign trips that will be shattered now by a domestic issue
*  that he dealt with literally just hours before getting on the plane, his decision to pardon
*  his son, Hunter Biden.
*  Well, Peter, I wonder if you can describe your reaction to that announcement, because
*  I think for a lot of us, for me at least, it was a real double take moment.
*  Like, I'm sorry, what?
*  What just happened?
*  And I wonder what your reaction was as a close student of Joe Biden's for decades as chief
*  White House reporter and as a really historically minded kind of thinker about the presidency.
*  Well, it's a big deal for a president to use his power of clemency to protect his own son
*  from the justice system.
*  Right.
*  This is something that hasn't happened before.
*  There have been a couple of occasions where presidents used the power of the pardon or
*  commutation to help people who are close to them, even members of the family.
*  Bill Clinton pardoned his brother, Roger, who had had old drug charges, and President
*  Donald Trump pardoned Jared Kushner's father from old tax evasion charges.
*  But this is the first time we've seen a president use the power for his own son and to head
*  off any punishment for that member of the family.
*  It was both the previous examples came after their sentences had been served and were basically
*  meant as statements of forgiveness, not preventing accountability.
*  In this case, President Biden is actually interceding before his son is even sentenced,
*  saying, no way I'm letting him go to prison.
*  And so in that moment, with the stroke of a pen, he has done something extraordinary
*  by upending the judicial system that he has spent his career and particularly the last
*  four years defending.
*  The pardon of his son now gives ammunition to Republicans, including Trump, to say that
*  the justice system doesn't work.
*  It is politicized.
*  Why do they say that?
*  Because now Joe Biden has said that.
*  And I think that's a big, big moment for Joe Biden's legacy.
*  We're going to return, Peter, to the implications of all of this, the meaning of it and how
*  it's going to fit into Biden's legacy.
*  But I wonder if we can start with how Biden got to this place, because pardoning his son,
*  Hunter, fully and unconditionally, is something that Biden said repeatedly that he would
*  never, ever do.
*  And I want to talk with you about why he said he would never do it and what you've come
*  to understand about why Biden ultimately changed his mind.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  Well, Biden, of course, campaigns for office and comes to office after the 2020 election
*  by accusing President Trump of politicizing the Justice Department, of making decisions
*  about law enforcement subject to his political will, going after his enemies and favoring
*  his friends. And he said he wasn't going to do that.
*  He was going to restore the system of justice.
*  But when he comes to office, he understands that his own son is already being investigated
*  by a U.S. attorney in Delaware on a number of possible issues.
*  And that U.S. attorney has been made into a special counsel, which is meant to insulate
*  that prosecution from politics.
*  And Biden makes a decision from the beginning he's going to keep that special counsel, or
*  at least not going to do anything to stop that special counsel from continuing.
*  And then Merrick Garland, his attorney general, makes the decision to keep that same special
*  counsel in place to demonstrate that they're not trying to influence this in any way, that
*  the special prosecutor should have the right to pursue the facts as he chooses.
*  So Biden was taking a hands off approach.
*  That's what he said. He was going to take a hands off approach.
*  Right. And in that sense, he's really putting his money where his mouth was during this
*  period, because he's saying to the world, you know, you certainly could understand why
*  I might want to intercede on behalf of my son, but I refuse on principle.
*  Exactly. He makes it a point of principle.
*  He makes it a point of contrast with his predecessor and now successor, Donald Trump.
*  And he uses this, in fact, to make the case that the Justice Department is, in fact,
*  neutral and making politics free decisions when they go after Trump, because his point
*  is, hey, the Justice Department that is prosecuting Trump is also prosecuting my son.
*  And I'm not having anything to do with either one of those things.
*  This is just based on facts and law.
*  That was the argument he was making.
*  Right. Because to cast doubt on one of those investigations was to potentially cast out
*  on all of them, which is why he's going to withhold judgment, steer clear of all this
*  stuff.
*  Exactly right. But parallel to all this, of course, is a separate track, which is a
*  partisan investigation by the House Republicans who are going after Hunter on all kinds of
*  sometimes unproven theories about all the different ways he might have abused his father's
*  influence to make money.
*  And so you have these two tracks going on, one, the professional prosecutors who end
*  up charging Hunter Biden with gun charges and tax charges.
*  And then the parallel House Republican investigation, which is seen certainly in the White
*  House as just an effort to damage the president.
*  But eventually, the official legal proceedings intensify and Hunter Biden is charged and
*  brought to trial.
*  And he's found guilty by a jury of his peers of lying on a firearms application form.
*  And then in a separate trial, he pleads guilty to tax evasion.
*  And these are real charges not bought by members of Congress, but by professional prosecutors
*  with judges and in one case, a jury that makes a finding.
*  And so Hunter faces a sentence that could last up to 25 years in one case, though as a
*  first time offender, he would likely expect a shorter sentence, possibly even just parole.
*  As we sit here in Normandy, your son, Hunter, is on trial.
*  And I know that you cannot speak.
*  We reporters are asking President Biden the obvious question.
*  Will you accept the jury's outcome, their verdict, no matter what it is?
*  Yes.
*  And have you ruled out a pardon for your son?
*  Yes.
*  You have.
*  Are you going to pardon your son?
*  And he tells us no.
*  Second one, would the president pardon or commute his son if he's convicted?
*  So I've answered this question before.
*  It was asked of me not to.
*  And his press secretary, Green Jean-Pierre, says it again and again.
*  We've been asked that question multiple times.
*  Our answer stands, which is no.
*  That question's been answered.
*  Our answer is still the same.
*  No, he will not intervene.
*  It's still a no.
*  It will be a no.
*  It is a no.
*  And I don't have anything else to add.
*  Will he pardon his son?
*  No.
*  Right.
*  And they don't leave, we should say, any wiggle room whatsoever.
*  They don't say, well, he's thinking about it and we'll get back to you.
*  They emphatically say he's not going to do this and he's not going to do this
*  because it betrays his stated values and his expectations about how the system
*  should work and the role that politics should or shouldn't play in the justice
*  system.
*  Exactly.
*  In fact, president Biden, one point he says that he accepts the outcome of the
*  first trial in which his son is convicted and he respects judicial process, which
*  is a way of signaling to the world at large and specifically in contrast to
*  Donald Trump, that he believes in the system.
*  He will not get involved himself.
*  He will not abandon what has been done there on behalf of his own family.
*  But obviously that's not the end of the story.
*  And this is the part where I would normally ask you what changed specifically,
*  but I think we can intuit that a big thing that changed was that Donald Trump
*  won the presidency.
*  Is that ultimately what seems to tip the scales here from the emphatic nose and
*  the principled position of I will not muddy the system to I'm going to pardon my son?
*  Yeah, I think obviously the only thing that's changed between June when he
*  begins saying that and today, December, when he gives this pardon is the election.
*  And you can look at it a couple of different ways.
*  You can look at it in the way of him not being honest in the summer that he really
*  was in fact considering this, but didn't want to say before an election because it
*  would be politically damaging.
*  And only after the election does he admit that in fact he is going to use this
*  extraordinary power for his son or.
*  And this may be an and or you can also look at it as waking up to the reality of
*  a Trump run justice department in which this new president is promising retribution
*  and specifically to go after Hunter Biden and a president who's on the way out
*  thinking, I'm not going to let that happen.
*  I'm not only going to pardon him for this tax and gun charges, I'm going to
*  protect him from the next guy who's making very clear he's going to use the
*  FBI for retribution.
*  And why would he think that?
*  Well, he has only to look at who Trump has been naming to run the nation's law
*  enforcement agencies.
*  Pam Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, he will nominate for attorney
*  general and Cash Patel, a former aide to him, will be confirmed by the Senate.
*  The FBI director, both of them are known as sharply partisan warriors who have
*  subscribed to Trump's conspiracy theories, his election lies and his taste for
*  retribution against his enemies.
*  And so you can tell Biden is protecting his son from Trump by the way he boards
*  it in the pardon.
*  The pardon just said.
*  Well, we'll talk about that.
*  Talk about talk about the way the pardon is articulated, the ground it covers and
*  what that reveals.
*  The pardon is rather extraordinary because it doesn't just say that we absolve
*  Hunter Biden of the convictions for which he has already been found, but we absolve
*  him of any crimes he may have committed on any kind of topic for 10 years, starting
*  in 2014 until 2024.
*  We haven't seen a pardon like that as sweeping as that in decades, probably not
*  since Watergate.
*  And what it says is in effect that no matter what Trump and his Republican allies
*  may come up with about Hunter, they can't prosecute him for that.
*  And it's really a way of insulating Hunter, not just from the convictions he's
*  already facing, but from any future investigation by and what Biden would
*  believe to be a politicized Trump administration, Justice Department.
*  Right.
*  It's like a flashing red light that says, don't even bother to investigate
*  Hunter Biden because this pardon means that the places you would look and the
*  charges you might bring, I have just made it impossible for you to charge him for
*  anything during that period.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's a 10 year get out of jail free card, right?
*  Anything he might have done wrong, including all the different suspicious
*  things that Republicans think that they have been looking into about trading
*  influence with businesses and so forth.
*  None of that is prosecutable anymore.
*  Well, what if anything does Biden say about his reasoning for why he issued
*  such a sweeping pardon?
*  On the one hand, he says, understandably that this is the act of a father, right?
*  He says, I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come
*  to this decision.
*  Those were his words.
*  And he's referring to the struggles that his son has had with addiction over the
*  years and that in his view, drug and alcohol addiction is really behind the
*  crimes for which he was convicted.
*  The lying on the firearms forum and the tax evasion were all a symptom of this
*  larger struggle that he is now in theory overcome.
*  If he had left it at that, that might be one thing.
*  I think a lot of people would have understood that even if they didn't think
*  it was the right thing to do.
*  But instead he adds to that a very blistering attack on the prosecution
*  against his son.
*  He says that his son would never have been brought for felony charges if it
*  hadn't been for his last name, that he's being singled out.
*  He says, in fact, in the statement he puts out with the pardon that no
*  reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other
*  conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.
*  And this is not, to your earlier point, a blistering attack just on partisan
*  Republican congressional investigations into his son.
*  This is a pretty blistering attack really on his own department of justice and
*  the lawyers and prosecutors within it who brought cases against his son.
*  Right.
*  He doesn't explicitly say the justice department is bad the same way Trump does
*  all the time, but he does say that raw politics, that's his phrase, raw politics
*  has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.
*  His words, how has it affected it?
*  He doesn't exactly say, but obviously who would it affect would be his
*  own justice department.
*  That he's saying that his own justice department through the special council,
*  which does have some insulation from politics in theory, has in fact been
*  influenced by the Republicans who have been out there banging the drums about
*  Hunter Biden and been tougher on his son in effect because of that.
*  And what really struck me in reading this statement was how much it sounded
*  like another president, Donald Trump, who's been saying a lot of the same
*  things about a broken justice department infected by politics.
*  And now suddenly that gives a whole new complexion to this debate about the
*  role of justice in American society.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Peter, in reflecting on what you said just before the break, it feels like what
*  Biden is asking the country to do with this pardon is to accept the idea that
*  the justice system made serious mistakes and was politicized in this one case
*  involving its pursuit of his son, but that we shouldn't apply that same
*  thinking to other cases that this justice department has taken up, including,
*  and perhaps above all, those brought against Trump.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's the kind of situational judgment that is of course problematic
*  because either the justice system is something you have faith in, or it's a
*  corrupted department at this point.
*  And Trump and his allies very quickly seized on this pardon to say, see, we
*  were right.
*  Even Biden now says that the justice department can be infected by politics,
*  can be used as a weapon against somebody.
*  And it's been used against our guy, Donald Trump, in these other cases, which
*  are far more serious, by the way, than anything Hunter Biden's been accused of.
*  But that distinction gets lost, right?
*  It ends up becoming a false equivalence, but one that's very useful politically.
*  Right.
*  And that's the risk that Biden, I think quite consciously understood he was
*  taking here, that he was going to be to some degree undermining people's faith
*  in the system.
*  But if you're Biden, there is kind of a reality, right, Peter, that Trump and his
*  appointees and his whole approach to the justice department does present a unique
*  threat to Hunter Biden.
*  And that I don't think many people doubt that Trump wanted to go after Hunter
*  Biden, said so.
*  And if we've learned anything about Trump, it's to believe him when he says
*  he's going to do something.
*  So if you're Biden and you want to protect your son, is there a reality that
*  you have to begin to operate on Trump's terms?
*  And that's really what happened here.
*  Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.
*  He is operating in some ways on Trump's terms.
*  He doesn't actually say that in the statement, which is interesting, right?
*  He talks about the current prosecutions that his son has faced being unfair and
*  selective.
*  He doesn't say the other part, which you just rightly focused on, which is that he
*  is guarding against politicization of the Justice Department by his successor.
*  Right.
*  He could have framed it that way, but he didn't.
*  But the net effect of what he did by making it a 10 year sweeping pardon for any
*  and everything that his son might have done does have that effect.
*  And it does tell you what was probably going through his mind when he decided to
*  issue the pardon.
*  And that makes me wonder, do you think that President Biden, and this is a
*  difficult question, I'll just preface it by saying that, would have issued this
*  pardon if Trump had lost and his vice president, Kamala Harris, had won the
*  election because that would have meant there was a much lower level of threat to
*  Hunter Biden under a Kamala Harris Department of Justice.
*  Yeah, that's an excellent question and one that we didn't get an answer to when we
*  asked the White House.
*  But you're right to ask it because it does make you wonder how much of this is
*  about saving him from the possible prison terms he might have under the guilty
*  verdicts he already has versus looking ahead at what's in store.
*  And it is possible that had the Democrats won, whether it had been him when he was
*  running or Harris when she was running, that he wouldn't have felt compelled to do
*  this, but we won't know.
*  And he hasn't said.
*  Peter, you mentioned how Trump and his Republican allies are responding to this
*  pardon, but I'm curious about how Democratic elected officials and operatives are
*  feeling about this decision, because you could see a world where some of them
*  might welcome it.
*  They might cheer it and say, finally, President Biden and Democrats, you are
*  living in the kind of hand-to-hand combat world of Donald Trump.
*  You're meeting him where he is, to use the phrase we just did a couple of minutes
*  ago, you're meeting him on his terms.
*  You could just as easily, however, see Democrats say, President Biden, you just
*  stooped to Trump's level.
*  You betrayed what you said you stood for.
*  And you've tarnished our entire political brand in the process, all to protect your
*  son.
*  Well, and Democrats being Democrats, they're saying both those things, right?
*  There are a number of Democrats out there who are saying, look, you know, the
*  president is right.
*  His son was targeted because he was his son, that there's no way he would have
*  gotten such harsh treatment had his name been Hunter Smith instead of Hunter
*  Biden.
*  You hear that most prominently, for instance, from Eric Holder, former attorney
*  general under President Obama.
*  And there's some truth to that, according to experts we have interviewed in the
*  past saying that, you know, that a lot of these cases like Hunter Biden's wouldn't
*  have gone as far as his did.
*  On the other hand, it's also worth pointing out that when Biden says his son is
*  being prosecuted for his last name, he didn't have any complaints when his son
*  was profiting in business using his last name.
*  Right.
*  Did all the companies give him millions of dollars because his name was Hunter
*  Biden, not Hunter Smith.
*  So, you know, being the son of a president has its benefits and its drawbacks.
*  And in this case, obviously you can argue that it's had both of those things.
*  But there are other Democrats, as you rightly point out, who are upset about
*  this, who say, no, this is not a good thing.
*  While it's totally understandable what a father might want to do, it undercuts the
*  independence of the justice system and undercuts the debate against Trump's
*  corruption of it.
*  I talked to Senator Michael Bennett, a Democrat from Colorado, who says totally
*  understands what a father must feel like in this, he said.
*  But it's, and he quotes here, another instance of putting his personal interests
*  ahead of his responsibility to the country.
*  And when Senator Bennett says another instance, is he referring to the first
*  instance being Biden staying in the race for president too long?
*  Exactly.
*  This pardon comes at a moment when Democrats are already pretty upset at
*  Biden over the election result, blaming him more than Kamala Harris for losing to
*  Donald Trump, believing that he put the Democrats in this position because he
*  decided to run for reelection, even though everyone knew he was going to be 86 by
*  the end of the second term and therefore would be problematic.
*  And that he himself knew his own approval ratings were pretty low and didn't give
*  the next generation a chance in a primary fashion to come up with a candidate,
*  whether it be Kamala Harris or somebody else, who would be tested and a proven
*  commodity by the time it came to a general election against Donald Trump.
*  So there's a lot of consternation about President Biden among Democrats.
*  This has stirred it even further.
*  Peter, it strikes me that the decision Biden made to stay in the presidential race
*  as long as he did, what Michael Bennett just referred to, and this decision to
*  pardon his son, Hunter, that they have some similarities because in both cases,
*  it feels to me anyway, Biden had to choose between a personal desire
*  and a pretty big principle.
*  The principle in the campaign decision was, should I step down for the good of
*  my party and the good of my country?
*  In the decision around his son, it was, do I choose my son or do I choose the
*  integrity of the system that I have defended for decades?
*  Yeah, I know this is a Shakespearean quality to this story, right?
*  In both those instances.
*  Look, presidents by definition are people with a certain degree of hubris.
*  They believe inevitably in their own greatness.
*  Otherwise, how can you look in the mirror and say, I am the person who should be
*  president of this country more than any of the other 330 million people who live
*  here, but it's also a very human story.
*  It is the story of a president who had to make a decision between principle on the
*  one hand and defending a system, even if you thought it had mishandled the
*  situation and allowing your son to go to prison.
*  And there's a sense of guilt there, right?
*  Again, this is Shakespearean.
*  He feels guilty.
*  The Hunter has been targeted.
*  He feels guilty about all that has happened to his son over these last few years.
*  That it isn't just Hunter's fault because of his addiction and because of those
*  mistakes that led to convictions that his life has been torn upside down.
*  And he's been tortured in a public setting because of him, the president, and
*  that he can make it right only by issuing this pardon.
*  Peter, I just want to end on the very question of pardons.
*  And I feel like I always return to a feeling of bewilderment that anyone has
*  been endowed in our democratic system with this singular power.
*  I had that feeling when Trump was pardoning Jared Kushner's father.
*  I had that question when Bill Clinton was pardoning a relative of his.
*  If I'm being honest, I have this question now when Joe Biden is pardoning his son.
*  Yeah, it is a kingly kind of power, right?
*  And the founders knew that when they wrote that into the constitution, but they
*  also viewed it as a check on a system that could go awry.
*  Right.
*  And they didn't necessarily envision it being a check on a system going awry
*  against the president's own family.
*  What they saw it as was a way to correct errors in the system against ordinary
*  Americans who are every day subjected to the justice system and in some cases,
*  unfairly treated.
*  And that's why there is a pardon office in the justice department that sends
*  recommendations to the president that has a process that tries in fact to correct
*  the wrongs of the system, because of course the system gets things wrong.
*  Every system does at some point or another.
*  But what happened here with Biden's part and then a lot of Trump's pardon for that
*  matter too, is that it didn't go through any process.
*  And that raises a lot of questions.
*  What is justice in America?
*  Who says it's fair and not tainted?
*  How do you take politics out of it?
*  And we seem to be putting more politics into it with each passing day.
*  Well, Peter, thank you very much.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  In a letter on Monday, the outgoing Senate Majority Leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer,
*  urged his Republican colleagues to push for traditional confirmation hearings and
*  FBI-led background checks for Donald Trump's cabinet picks.
*  The letter comes as Trump and those around him signal an eagerness to fill his cabinet
*  through recess appointments that bypass Senate votes and without FBI background
*  checks that might uncover embarrassing facts about his choices.
*  And the CEO of the computer chip giant, Intel, has stepped down in the latest sign
*  of the company's troubles.
*  On Monday's show, we used Intel as a case study of why President Biden's plans to
*  revive U.S.
*  manufacturing will be so challenging.
*  The Biden administration hopes to invest billions of dollars into Intel to promote
*  domestic manufacturing.
*  But Intel has failed to keep up with its rivals and has increasingly lost the
*  confidence of tech companies that rely on advanced computer chips.
