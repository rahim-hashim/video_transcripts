# Israel's Existential Threat From Within
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZqA7KKBY6w)
*  From The New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is a special episode of The Daily.
*  The eyes of the world have been on the war in Gaza, which has no end in sight.
*  But there is another conflict in the other Palestinian territory that has gotten less
*  attention, where life has become increasingly untenable.
*  The West Bank.
*  They demolished the school, they demolished most of the houses.
*  Overnight in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military has carried out new raids.
*  It's part of an upsurge in violence across the West Bank involving Palestinian armed
*  groups, Israeli settlers and Israeli forces.
*  Today, I talk to my colleague Ronan Bergman about why things are likely to get worse,
*  and the long history of the extremist political forces inside Israel that he says are leading
*  the country to an existential crisis.
*  It's Wednesday, September 18th.
*  So Ronan, as we've seen in recent weeks, the war in Gaza is nowhere near a ceasefire.
*  In the West Bank, there's this increase in violence, a rise in Israeli and Palestinian
*  terrorism.
*  And you and our colleague Mark Mazzetti have not only been reporting on what's going on
*  there now, but you've also done an extensive investigation about why this is happening.
*  And what you found is that it has everything to do with the rise of the extreme right in
*  Israel.
*  Yes, there's a huge escalation of violence in the West Bank right now, and it can be
*  explained by a long and complicated story.
*  It's a story of 60 years of internal battle in Israel that has brought us to this moment
*  where many in Israel who want a lawful, democratic country are now losing out to ultra-nationalist
*  hard-right extremists who are now in a powerful position in the Israeli government and who
*  are dragging the country to the brink of an existential crisis.
*  All right.
*  So where did you start the reporting that led to this conclusion?
*  So back in 2015, one event really convinced me to pursue this story.
*  Fury today at a senseless crime in a region that has seen so many.
*  When Jewish terrorists burned down a house in the West Bank village called Douma.
*  The person is throwing fire bombs into the house, setting it alight and killed the Palestinian
*  family, three people, including a toddler, the victim, this time a Palestinian toddler,
*  18 month old Ali.
*  The watch.
*  And it was horrifying.
*  The attack is believed to have been carried out by militant Jewish settlers who scrawled
*  menacing messages on the walls of the family's home.
*  And so as I was reporting about this horrible incident, I spoke with the person called Amia
*  Yalon, Major General Amia Yalon, who was the former chief of the Shin Bet.
*  That's the Israeli security agency, the sort of equivalent to the FBI.
*  And I asked him something like, how come the Shin Bet is just unable to prevent this kind
*  of horrible, horrible attack?
*  I had this this question in my mind for four years because the attack on Douma, that poor
*  family was not an isolated thing for decades.
*  There have been many attacks on Palestinians from Jewish extremists, destruction of property,
*  violence, killing of cattle and cases of murder.
*  And because the Shin Bet is known, has a long time reputation, at least until October 7,
*  it's famous for protecting Israeli citizens from all kinds of terrorist attacks from Arab
*  militants.
*  I try to understand from Yalon, why can they do the same for Jewish terrorists as they
*  are doing for Palestinian terrorists?
*  There must be some kind of equivalent lines in how you catch a terrorist.
*  But he said, don't you know that the Shin Bet is plugged into a much, much bigger phenomena
*  of the failure of the whole Israeli administration, defense establishment, the prosecutors, the
*  judges, the police, all of them, in enforcing the law on the extreme settlers and the ultra-right
*  nationalists in Israel.
*  He said it all comes from the political level.
*  The cabinet, the government, the prime minister, they are signaling to the Shin Bet and the
*  other relevant law enforcement agencies that if a Jew is killed by terrorists, it's horrible.
*  But if an Arab is killed by terrorists, it's not good, but it's not that bad.
*  And then on top of that, while asking sources, while asking Israeli officials this same question
*  about investigating Jewish extremism, other officials and former officials made very dark
*  predictions.
*  Some of them said that because this violence against Arabs is tolerated, it won't be long
*  until the lawless, until the fugitives, until those Jewish extremists, sometimes Jewish
*  terrorists will become the law, will become a legitimate part of the Israeli government.
*  So these officials almost 10 years ago were saying to you, Jewish terrorists are so tolerated
*  by the Israeli government that they will one day become the law.
*  They will become that government.
*  Yes.
*  You know, sometimes people come to me, sources, officials, NGOs, and tell me stories that
*  I titled them too bad to be true.
*  It's like, you know, it's a script, nice script for a Netflix episode.
*  But you know, it's too much.
*  But when taking a much deeper dive with my great colleagues and friends, Mark Mazedi,
*  Nathan Odenheimer, for over eight and a half years, we talked to hundreds of people, including
*  many, many high-rank Israeli government officials, American government officials, former heads
*  of the Shin Bet and other agencies, former prime ministers.
*  And we looked at different video documentation of programizing our village.
*  We looked at massive throws of secret documents.
*  And at the end of that long, long journey, what we found was not only that the dark predictions
*  of those officials from years ago became the reality, but also that this happened because
*  the state of Israel was just looking the other way.
*  After many years of reporting in Israel, it is clear to me that at the end of the day,
*  Israel will be able to defend itself from outside enemies.
*  Where the real danger lies is inside.
*  It's about the challenging to the foundation of the Jewish state as a democratic and as
*  a lawful country that protects everybody and enforce the law on everybody.
*  And the depth of the challenge threatens the foundation of the country, of my country.
*  So Ronan, just to prepare people here, the history of all of this that you're outlining,
*  it is so thoroughly reported, very sweeping.
*  It spans many, many decades.
*  And it's really the story of the battle over what Israel should be and how the ultra-right's
*  vision of Israel seems to be winning that battle now.
*  So where should we start?
*  So I think a good point to start is at the end of the Six-Day War, June 1967.
*  The whole Middle East was thrown into war.
*  For the third time since its birth as an independent state, Israel is embroiled in
*  a war with the Arab nations that surround it.
*  But it lasted only six days.
*  Israel took the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank and East
*  Jerusalem from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria.
*  In practical terms, Israel seized territory twice its original size, expanding in all
*  directions, taking control over a territory with something like a million Palestinians
*  signaling an unbelievable triumphant victory against three massive Arab armies.
*  And the transition was swift.
*  The citizens of Israel woke up and felt now they are a superpower.
*  Even from the first day, the first day after the war, it was unclear what Israel is going
*  to do with this massive territory that is just seized.
*  Many people in Israel thought that they need to barter back the territories for peace,
*  basically returning it to the Arab countries or creating a new Palestinian state for those
*  million Palestinians and others in the diaspora.
*  But other people with ultra-nationalist religious background, according to their belief, seizing
*  those territories was the hand of God.
*  It was the Jewish people coming back to the biblical Israel.
*  That land, the territories, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, according to their belief,
*  was promised to the Jewish people by God, making them, the Jews, the Israelis, the
*  owner of this place.
*  So these are two very different reactions to Israel suddenly being in control of all
*  this land.
*  One side sees this new land as something that they can trade to establish peace and security
*  for Israelis, essentially a bargaining chip.
*  Another side sees this as a chance to keep the land for Jews.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Okay, so with these two visions, I want to talk about who is in each camp.
*  Let's start with the people who don't want to keep the territories like the West Bank
*  forever, and who want to barter the land back for peace.
*  Who are they?
*  So they are largely people who are sort of aligned politically with the original founders
*  of Israel, people who are mostly secular, more leaning to the left, people who want
*  to have a democratic Jewish state that ensures the security of Jews, but who also understand
*  that the Arab neighbors, the neighboring states of Israel, and of course the Palestinians,
*  they will never accept Israel taking over this entire territory.
*  And the fact that they don't have their own Palestinian state, this will always be a major
*  obstacle to any positive development in the Middle East.
*  Those people are open to negotiate an Israeli withdrawal and establishment of a Palestinian
*  state, and they are primarily interested in Israel's security over everything else.
*  Security to them means not just defending yourself from outside forces, but also having
*  a democratic, lawful state.
*  And what about the other side, the people who want to make territory like the West Bank
*  part of Israel permanently?
*  Who are they and what's their backstory?
*  You know, it's not monolithic, but broadly speaking, they are like two groups.
*  One, let's call them secular right-wingers.
*  They potentially could discuss an establishment of a Palestinian state, but they say that
*  from a sheer point of security, it would be much safer for Israel to control the West
*  Bank rather than to give the West Bank to another state, another entity that they are
*  concerned will become hostile to Israel.
*  And then there is another group who are looking at the situation from a very different point
*  of view.
*  They believe that by actually controlling these lands, they could hasten the arrival
*  of the Messiah.
*  And in order to make sure that this Messiah will come as soon as possible, the right way
*  to do that would be to establish settlements in those occupied territories to make sure
*  they will never be given back to an Arab nation or Palestinian people.
*  But Israel got control over these territories in the war.
*  So why this need to settle them?
*  So the official relationship is it's an occupied territory and occupied territory.
*  According to international law, everybody are under the authority of the military commander
*  and under the rule of military law.
*  Many of those ultra nationalist religious Israelis, they realize that military can be
*  ordered to evacuate during some kind of a peace treaty because military does what it's
*  told to do.
*  But when you have at the beginning small outposts, then settlements, then cities, those are going
*  to be very hard to evacuate.
*  All right.
*  So Israel gets this land.
*  Some Israelis see this land as leverage, something to trade with Arab adversaries or for a Palestinian
*  state.
*  But this other group of religious ultra nationalists are like, no, all that land is ours by divine
*  right and we don't ever want to trade this land away for anything.
*  And the best way to prevent the land from being given away is by settling the land themselves,
*  knowing that it would be harder to give away if there are Jewish Israelis living there.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  But there's one small problem.
*  It was illegal under the military orders.
*  The military that governs these territories.
*  So what these religious ultra nationalists wanted to do is just not allowed by the state.
*  But they started taking action towards that goal anyway.
*  So the central ultra nationalist religious group was called Gush Emunim, the block of
*  the faithful.
*  And so one day in 1975, they, Gush Emunim, suddenly came to a deserted Jordanian military
*  camp in the West Bank and declare that this is their outpost.
*  Bloody violating orders from the military that this is totally, totally illegal.
*  And instead of ordering the military, Shimon Peres, who was in charge of the military and
*  the IDF and therefore in charge of the West Bank, he was not a settler or an ultra nationalist
*  supporter in any way.
*  I don't think he liked them.
*  But fearing to confront them and their base, he allowed them to stay.
*  And in order not to call that just impunity and disregarding the law that he was supposed
*  to enforce, he called that a working camp.
*  And so Peres was creating an alibi for himself and for the state.
*  And those tricks, this euphemism, this laundering of words and terminology is the first move
*  that showed the settlers that even if they do something that is bluntly illegal, if they
*  are stubborn enough, they will win.
*  Right.
*  Which seems like it would only embolden them to learn that they can get away with breaking
*  the law.
*  Yes.
*  It gave them massive backwind.
*  And so that early settlement, it grew.
*  It grew into many more settlements that spread across the West Bank and eventually some years
*  later to Gaza.
*  And that point in the late 70s, the settlement project by those ultra nationalists was fully
*  underway and they thought they wouldn't have any more resistance because in 1977, for the
*  first time in Israel history, the right, the Likud party is in control of the country
*  and it's led by Menachem Begin.
*  And typically leaders on the right were supportive of the settlement, not so eager to negotiate
*  with Arab neighbors, peace in return for land.
*  But Begin surprised everybody.
*  Israel now celebrates a great victory for the nations of Egypt and Israel and for all
*  mankind.
*  At the first part of his term, he signs a historical peace accord with Egypt.
*  The Smitty summit at Camp David is over and Israel and Egypt have agreed to two documents
*  taking a giant step toward achieving peace in their troubled corner of the world.
*  And in return for peace, he gives back the whole of the Sinai Peninsula after evacuating
*  the Jewish Israeli settlements from there.
*  On Israel's side, it seems that Begin has agreed to negotiate the removal of Israeli
*  settlements from the Sinai.
*  So Israel negotiates a way of land for peace.
*  Exactly.
*  Now both Sadat and Begin are left with the responsibility of selling those concessions
*  to their own constituencies.
*  So while the Menachem Begin government supported the ongoing settlement campaign, it also gave
*  back territory that the settlers thought should not be given back at any price, at any cost,
*  at any term, because they are part of the biblical land of Israel.
*  And they saw that as a threat that it will happen again.
*  That more land might be bartered away.
*  Yes.
*  And so the withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula led to an outburst of violence from the settlers.
*  Some extreme settlers wanted to signal to the Israeli government that they would cause
*  chaos if any more land is negotiated away with the Arab countries.
*  And so they start attacking Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
*  And then in June of 1980, what was later called the Jewish Underground, which was
*  an extremist offshoot within the settler movement, attempted to blow up three prominent Palestinian
*  mayors in the West Bank.
*  They put bombs in the cars and severely injured two of them.
*  And so once these attacks happened, some senior officials at the military just failed to condemn them.
*  What did they say?
*  They said, this is welcome.
*  The military commander of the West Bank, when referred to the bombs that hit the lower part
*  of the body of the mayors, he said, it's a pity they did not aim higher, hinting that
*  he wished they died.
*  Now, when the settlers, when the members of this group, the Jewish Underground, when they
*  hear the military commander of the area saying something like that, they understand what
*  everybody would understand.
*  This is encouragement.
*  This is not condemning.
*  This is not enforcing the law.
*  This is sort of a wicked nod with a smile, with humor.
*  Why didn't they aim higher?
*  They should have killed them.
*  So this is a very clear sign from the people who were supposed to be enforcing the law
*  that violence toward Palestinians is not only not bad, it might even be good.
*  That's right.
*  So Ronan, in this period of the 1980s, were Israelis trying to fight back against this
*  apathy toward Palestinian lives and just general disregard for the rule of law in the West
*  Bank?
*  I assume Israelis would be appalled.
*  I don't think theoretically that you are wrong, Sabrina.
*  I just think that they didn't know.
*  The people in Israel, the public, they didn't know what is happening there.
*  It's remote, relatively remote, to distances in Israel.
*  The press was almost not covering anything that happened there.
*  But there were people who got made aware of the situation, this impunity, and they realized
*  how horrible the situation is.
*  So a group of law professors from both the Tel Aviv and the Jerusalem Hebrew universities
*  wrote a letter to the attorney general of Israel.
*  They said, you should open an investigation about Jewish terrorism and violence.
*  And the attorney general, he was appalled.
*  He didn't know as well.
*  He's the attorney general of the state, and he doesn't know.
*  So he calls in his deputy for special duties, Judith Karp.
*  He assigned her to lead a committee that would go and thoroughly investigate the claims and
*  concerns of those professors.
*  When they started to investigate, they realized that the situation on the ground is much worse
*  than described in the professor's letter.
*  And they discovered the whole system of total negligence, inability to execute efficient
*  and just interrogation, investigation on claims of Jewish crimes.
*  They found the police that is completely incapable of doing its job, and the military,
*  that in spite of being in charge of the security of the region, is completely helpless.
*  It supplied that security to the Palestinian inhabitants.
*  So this Karp report was pretty damning.
*  Pretty damning.
*  And then this was so secret because, of course, the local and international implications of
*  such a report are significant.
*  But the attorney general was assured by the ministers that this will be brought to the
*  cabinet and thoroughly discussed, and there will be steps taken following that.
*  And the long-time minister of the police invited Karp to his home to discuss the report.
*  Now, Karp was sure that he wants to hear more, maybe to congratulate her for this work.
*  But instead, she recalls, he started to attack her for what they are doing.
*  And soon she realized that they are going to do nothing.
*  They are going to bury the report, which, at the end,
*  led Karp to resign the post as leading the team because she realized nothing is going to be done.
*  And in retrospect, Karp said, we were naive.
*  And so the 80s and the 90s saw a growing turmoil in the West Bank and Gaza.
*  The settlement project continues, and there were more and more attacks from extremists on both sides.
*  And then in 1987, the Palestinian frustration from the continuous occupation and the settlement project
*  explodes into something that would be known as the first intifada, the first uprising.
*  Palestinians just had enough, and it was clear to them that with the harassment,
*  the condoning of violence, the expansion of the settlements, it was clear that Israel was not
*  really interested in bartering the West Bank and Gaza for reconciliation.
*  And the Palestinians were just furious.
*  Massive protests.
*  Massive protests. Some of it deteriorates into violence and terrorism with many thousands of
*  young Israeli soldiers that are sent to the territories to crush the protest.
*  And that, along with this idea of continuous support to the settlements,
*  most Israelis just came to feel that this is not what they want.
*  But it just cannot go on.
*  And this leads Yitzhak Rabin, the head of the Labour Party, the party on the left,
*  winning a triumphant victory in 1992.
*  Because people in Israel were seeking for a solution, they were seeking for reconciliation,
*  and Rabin tried to do something different.
*  Rabin was a famous military commander who devoted his whole life to the security of Israel.
*  But while focusing on making sure people in Israel feel safe, he also promised he would
*  try to negotiate a sustainable peace with the Palestinians. And people thought that if anyone
*  could do that, it was Rabin. We'll have to reach the agreement.
*  The partner are the Palestinians in the territory.
*  Now, everybody understood that any kind of agreement with the Palestinian people or with
*  their representative, the PLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, needs to have, first of
*  foremost, an agreement to a Palestinian state. And in that Palestinian state, the vast majority,
*  all the settlements will be taken down and the people in them should be withdrawn back into the
*  borders of Israel.
*  So you're saying that Rabin's election really represented a realization among Israelis that the
*  vision of the ultra-nationalists and the settlers was a problem. And it was time to change course,
*  negotiate, ultimately to give land back to the Palestinians.
*  Yes. So first of all, he ordered a total freezing of all new settlements.
*  But second, he agreed to a secret channel with the PLO that ended with what we know as the
*  Oslo Peace Accords.
*  Today, the leadership of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization will sign a declaration
*  of principles on interim Palestinian self-government.
*  Historical agreement with the Palestinian Liberation Organization with its chief,
*  Yasser Arafat, and at the end signing a roadmap that though not declared in those words,
*  but was the roadmap for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
*  And there was a moment of great hope echoed in the speeches of Isaac Rabin who said,
*  Today we are embarking on a battle which has no dead and no wounded, no blood and no anguish.
*  This is the only battle which is a pleasure to wage the battle for peace.
*  Now it's time to turn for peace.
*  You're describing this as a moment of hope, but just for some, right, Renan? I mean,
*  not for everybody. For the ultra-nationalists, I expect they had a very different reaction to this.
*  Yes, from their point of view, it's a blasphemy. Of course, they understand this is the end of
*  the whole project. So the ultra-nationalists, again, as in the 80s, following the withdrawal
*  from the Sinai Peninsula after the peace accord with Egypt, again, they sought to undermine this
*  effort towards peace, which they understood would involve giving away more land.
*  So they reacted with more violence towards the Palestinians.
*  There was an escalation of harassment and attacks, and that reached a peak on the 25th of February
*  1994. Baruch Goldstein, one of the most, according to Shilbet, the most dangerous
*  activist of the ultra-right and settlers in Israel back then, wearing IDF uniforms,
*  carrying a Galil assault rifle, entered the cave of the patriarch, a holy place of worship for both
*  Jews and Muslims. It was in the middle of Ramadan. It was full with local Palestinians praying,
*  and he just stood in front of them, easily crossing all the cross-checks and cross-points
*  and screening processes that should have been and were not in place by the Israeli police and military.
*  He stood there and just opened fire, replacing the empty magazine again and again.
*  He was able to kill 29 of the worshippers, injuring 125 of them.
*  In the West Bank town of Hebron, a U.S.-born Israeli settler named Baruch Goldstein opens fire
*  in a crowded mosque. And at the end, he was taken down by the other worshippers and killed.
*  That shocked everybody, and most of all, it shocked Rabin, who gave a speech
*  on the Knesset, the Israeli parliament podium, where he said
*  to those who applauded what Goldstein just did, he said, you are not part of us. You are not part
*  of the Jewish people. We don't have any connection with you. Trying to outcast them.
*  But of course, it did not kill the movement or the spirit or stop the activity of the fans and
*  followers. Maybe even was inflated by what Goldstein has done, which they saw as an act of
*  courage. Something that should have been done not just to those, but to all the Arabs. And they
*  just continued. What happened was that not only do the Israeli ultra-right extremists not stop this
*  violence, they celebrate the violence and eventually wrap up the violence to a degree that no one in
*  Israel could have even imagined. And so after the Israeli government did not allow to bury Goldstein
*  in Hebron, in the West Bank, one of them, an extremist supporter, probably the most vocal one,
*  he was able to erect a tomb for Goldstein in Kiryat Arba, that's a nearby settlement,
*  with an epitaph saying that Goldstein was a saint, that he died with clean hands
*  and with pure heart. This young extremist supporter of this mass shooting,
*  he was just a teenager. He had joined the youth movement of a political group that advocated the
*  expulsion of Arabs from Israel. And for many years, on the anniversary of this massacre,
*  this young man paraded and celebrated. He danced and he sang for the saint, for his clean hands and
*  his clean hands and pure heart, Goldstein. And the name of that person, back then, it meant nothing
*  to any Israeli. His name was Itamar Ben-Gavir. Itamar Ben-Gavir, maybe the most prominent figure
*  in the ultra-right movement today and a member of Netanyahu's cabinet. Not just the member of
*  the cabinet, but also the minister for national security in charge of the police, the person who
*  was arrested dozens of times, indicted and also at the end convicted in incitement to racism
*  and in support of terrorist organization. And now he is in charge of the police. The lawless became
*  the law.
*  The Lawless
*  Maybe the one thing that everybody in Israel remembered was when the same Itamar Ben-Gavir
*  in October 1995 held the honoument of a Cadillac that he said he stole from the
*  prime minister car and said, in the same way that we could get to steal that,
*  meaning we could get to Rabin's car, we will get to Rabin himself.
*  So he holds up the hood ornament that he apparently ripped off of Rabin's car and he's saying,
*  if we can get this hood ornament, we can get to him. Meaning we could kill him?
*  That's right. And then on November 4th, 1995, just a few weeks after Itamar Ben-Gavir
*  showed off with this ornament of the Cadillac, the Shilbert was unable to protect Rabin's life
*  from one assassin with a gun that in the most almost nonchalant way,
*  passed all security, pulled the gun and killed the prime minister of the Jewish state.
*  Rabin stepped off the stage. A gunman slipped through and fired at point-blank range.
*  Police have the apparent assassin in custody. He's described as a law student in his 20s
*  and as affiliated with radical Jewish settlers.
*  Egal Amir, the 27-year-old law student who said that God told him to kill the prime minister of Israel.
*  And so we see how far the most extreme on the far right were willing to go to realize their goal,
*  settling all the biblical land of Israel and preventing peace with the Palestinians.
*  They were not just willing to terrorize Palestinians in the territories.
*  They were willing to kill Palestinians, to kill Israelis, Jews, the leader of the Jewish state of
*  Israel. And with that assassination, Rabin's effort to stop the ultra nationalist movement
*  and the settlement project died as well.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, Renan, so far you've told us about the origins of this kind of epic battle over land and
*  dueling visions for what Israel should be, a lawful democratic country or one ruled by
*  extremist forces and how the extremists got so brazen that they killed their own prime
*  minister Yitzhak Rabin because he was going to give away land in exchange for a peace deal.
*  So how do we go from that assassination of Rabin to the present where those same extremists,
*  including Itamar Ben-Gavir, are central figures in the Israeli government?
*  So after Rabin's assassination, the Oslo peace process faltered and eventually falls apart,
*  which is of course exactly what the extremists wanted. The settlement project in the West Bank
*  and Gaza continues to expand. Roads, electricity, they all continue to run to more and more
*  settlements. In fact, in this period, the state itself was secretly funding and constructing
*  these illegal settlements through a network of officials in the government that intentionally
*  obscure the state participation. Meaning like actual taxpayer funded resources are secretly
*  going into developing illegal settlements in the West Bank. Yes, that's right. And of course,
*  as we've seen in the past, like with the first Intifada, the first uprising, when it's clear to
*  the Palestinians that Israel isn't committed to preventing illegal settlements and isn't
*  really working towards giving Palestinians an independent state, it creates frustration.
*  And that frustration is then very easily exploited by Palestinian extremists like Hamas.
*  They try to inflame the situation and again, they succeed. Only this time, it was much, much worse.
*  There was a huge explosion of violence and it was later called the second Intifada.
*  A suicide bomber killed at least 15 people late today in Israel.
*  The blast targeted a nightclub in a town south of Tel Aviv.
*  The second Intifada, the second uprising erupted on the 29th of September 2000 with a total loss
*  of control by the Israeli military. One of the worst suicide bombing jet tonight at a resort hotel
*  in northern Israel. And a wave of suicide bombers that seems to be endless from Hamas and Palestinian
*  Islamic Jihad. Palestinian woman carrying explosives blew herself up in a restaurant.
*  At least 19 Israelis were killed including several children.
*  And of course, Israel responds with force.
*  Tonight, Israel's top leaders are meeting to decide how to retaliate.
*  The government sources, there will be a harsh response. The Israeli public already demanding
*  sharp, quick, hard retaliation against the Palestinians.
*  And at the end of five years of uprising and attacks,
*  around 1,000 Israelis and 3,000 Palestinians were killed.
*  And after that, the Israeli population largely moved politically to the right.
*  The appetite for working with Palestinians towards peace was essentially gone.
*  And the desire for a heavy hand against the Palestinians won the day.
*  In 2001, they elected Ariel Sharon as prime minister.
*  And Sharon has been known for years for his avid support of the settlement project.
*  And also his harsh treatment of the Palestinians during his time in the military,
*  during his time as Minister of Defense.
*  So unlike the first intifada where Israelis reacted by electing someone who would aim for peace,
*  this time the Israelis elected a right-wing leader who they thought would crush the uprising with
*  force.
*  Sharon soon realized that he needs to do a total political reversal.
*  That the only way to sustain the Jewish project of Israel, to continue to be in good standing
*  in the world, there is no other alternative but to go to a political solution with the Palestinians.
*  To go for a two-state solution. And that he cannot do without disassembling the illegal settlements.
*  So basically, Sharon comes to a similar conclusion as Rabin, even though they're on totally different
*  sides of the political spectrum and started with totally different attitudes about the settlement
*  project. They both end up at the conclusion that the only way to achieve security for Israel is to
*  negotiate with the Palestinians, which means giving back land in exchange for peace.
*  Yes. And so he did a few things. The most important of which was to declare the disengagement,
*  pulling out of Gaza and disassembling some of the settlements in the West Bank, which you know,
*  was not very popular with his own base and very unpopular with the Jewish ultra-nationalist.
*  There was even an incident where a group of extreme right-wingers, settlers, attempted to
*  blow up a major Israeli highway, all to prevent the withdrawal from Gaza. Now, that plot was foiled,
*  but it shows how much the extremists hated this move by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
*  a guy who used to be the greatest champion of the settlement project, but now was trying to pull out
*  of Gaza. Despite their efforts, however, the pullout eventually does happen in 2005.
*  So Ariel Sharon successfully pulls out of Gaza, but what happened with his parallel effort to pull
*  out of the West Bank? So he ordered the disassemblement of settlements, but somehow
*  this coffee didn't get down the machine. The orders vaporized through the chain of command
*  and nothing happened. Why? What went wrong? The secret aid given to the illegal settlement project
*  was so absorbed into the administration because the government services were so infiltrated by
*  sympathizers to the settlements. It would have taken a long time to bypass the obstacles that
*  were put in order to prevent the disassembly of the settlements. So Prime Minister Sharon was
*  giving orders, trying to overcome the resistance inside the administration, but before enough
*  robust effort could be put in place in January 2006, Prime Minister Sharon suffered a stroke.
*  He went into a coma from which he never recovered. He ran out of time to really dismantle the
*  government network that had been supporting the settlers there. Yes, but the extremists,
*  what they deducted from this affair was that there is a viable threat for yet more
*  withdrawals, more evacuations, more negotiation for peace with the Palestinians,
*  something they have to prevent. Like if Sharon, a champion of the settlement movement, was willing
*  to pull out of Gaza and try to withdraw from the West Bank, then any leader might try it again.
*  Exactly. One of their chief ideologists told me years later, he said their conclusion
*  was that as long as the state has all those institutions, the Supreme Court, the Ministry
*  of Justice, the military, there will always be a threat for yet another evacuation, maybe a total
*  evacuation of the whole of the West Bank, which they see as their own. And so they need to make
*  yet a step further, not just to erect more settlements, but to actually take apart or
*  control those institutions. They had to come to the inside. They have to come to the inside
*  to infiltrate the administration that they hate so much, meaning they have to become politicians.
*  And so some of these extremists decide to come out of the shadows. They get proper haircuts,
*  put on a suit. And Sabrina, you remember Itamar Ben-Gvir? Of course. The guy who celebrated the
*  mass murder of Palestinians in Hebron, who stole the hood ornament from Rabid's car
*  just before his assassination. So Ben-Gvir, he goes to law school and he became the leader of,
*  at that time, a very small far-right extremist political party called Otsma Yehudit, or Jewish
*  power. Just by the name you can understand the nature. And another extremist, a settler named
*  Bezalel Smotrich, he started building up his political career as well. Do you remember the
*  plot to blow up the highway when Sharon was pulling out of Gaza? So there was substantial
*  evidence that Smotrich was part of that plot, though he was never prosecuted. Like Ben-Gvir,
*  he goes to become a more public-facing activist for racist anti-Arab policies,
*  and he becomes involved in yet another very small far-right Israeli party called the religious
*  Zionist party. So both these guys, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, they are still ideologically on the far
*  right, but now they're also professional politicians who today are both in very powerful
*  positions in the Netanyahu government. Well, how did that happen exactly? How did they go from the
*  extreme fringe to the center of power? Well, it took a while. Initially, Netanyahu shunned
*  the hard-right ultra-nationalists, and he famously wouldn't share the stage with them. But fast
*  forward to 2019, Netanyahu, this is when he gets indicted on corruption charges.
*  And that leads to a situation ending with none of the central or the left-wing parties agreeing
*  to sit in his coalition. They said, you, Netanyahu, you cannot continue because you are on trial for
*  corruption and bribery and other charges. You cannot be the prime minister. So eventually,
*  he does lose the prime ministership in 2021. But Netanyahu, who never lost hope to come back again,
*  he wants to regain his post as prime minister. Benjamin Netanyahu, in order to form a governing
*  coalition, has now aligned himself with nationalist and orthodox parties. And Netanyahu understood
*  that the only way he could get enough support to become prime minister again is to partner up with
*  the very small ultra-right parties and their leaders, say Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, because
*  they are some of the only politicians who would have anything to do with him anymore.
*  Hmm.
*  Breaking news in the Middle East as well. Benjamin Netanyahu will become prime minister of Israel
*  once again. His return is being directly tied to the rise of his allies, Israel's extreme right.
*  This is being described as Israel's most far-right government since the country was established back
*  in 1948. So the bottom line is that people who have been actively supported of terrorism,
*  or people who have advocated for the most extreme racist idea, who just years before he,
*  Netanyahu, wouldn't be seen with, now he partners with them. Now Netanyahu can rise again to be the
*  prime minister, but only thanks to the support of Itamar Ben-Gvir and Betzalov Smotrich,
*  who are now key pillars of his coalition. In return for their support,
*  Netanyahu gives them high-ranking position in his cabinet, because for Netanyahu, worse than
*  aligning with the violent extremists would be for himself to lose power. So Ben-Gvir is the minister
*  of national security and Smotrich is both the minister of finance, so controlling the budget
*  of the country, and a minister at the ministry of defense, controlling all Israeli state civilian
*  activities in the West Bank. So because it's the only way to get back into power, Netanyahu goes
*  all the way with the extremists, giving them control over the territories they've spent
*  their lives trying to claim. Yes, that's right. Okay, so how does the rise of the right play out
*  on the ground in the West Bank after leaders like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich move into those powerful
*  positions in the government? I think the best example was in February 2023, just two months
*  after the new government was sworn in. Two settlers, two brothers, sat in a car going through
*  Hawara. It's a small town in the West Bank, and many settlers and Palestinians are going
*  through every day. The terrorists from Hamas approached their car, pulled a gun, and murdered
*  them. And shortly afterwards, the social media of the ultra-right was swamped with calls for revenge.
*  One of the leaders of one of the regional councils of the settlers said that they should go and wipe
*  Hawara out. That's the name of that village. And Smotrich, a minister at the Ministry of Defense,
*  when asked, he said, yes, I think we should wipe out Hawara.
*  Just to make sure that he's understood, he said, but I think the state should do that.
*  We should not leave it to private, individual hands. And of course, after he was threatened
*  not to be allowed to the U.S., he said, I was not understood. But of course, it's all recorded. But
*  the main thing is that people in the West Bank, settlers, they got it.
*  Four hundred of them that night went and attacked Hawara and burned down houses and cars and animals
*  heard of those villages. And one Palestinian, Sameh Al-Aqtash, was murdered.
*  One Israeli commander in the region later, when he spoke with us, he called it a pogrom.
*  He chose a word, obviously, with special significance to Israel, special significance to
*  Jews, because, of course, that's the word used to describe what happened to Jews attacked in Eastern
*  Europe. And the Shin Bet and the police and the military, though they monitor the social media,
*  though it was clear that it's going to happen. You and I could get the warning because it's just
*  there on social media. They don't even bother. They lost the shame. They don't even bother to
*  hide this. But in spite of all of that, this was still not prevented. And I arrived to Hawara a
*  few hours later. It was still burning. And I started to look at that case. So four hundred
*  settlers attacking a village. But in spite of that being a terrorist attack, nobody was charged
*  for what happened. The military said, we are not sure that he died of shooting or another health
*  issue. I had the picture of his body in the hospital where he died. And he had clear signs
*  of a bullet, big bullet here in the chest. I sent her the idea of spokesperson, the picture,
*  said, yes, he died of a health issue called the bullet. It was clear how he died. And then I
*  learned that the police has a GoPro video taken by a camera on the chest of one of the policemen
*  of a settler shooting. And they did not even arrest that settler. It's unbelievable. A person
*  dies. They have a GoPro of at least suspected person to shoot him. It's just, I would say,
*  a total nonchalant to human lives. So they just stopped enforcing the law when it comes to
*  settlers in the West Bank? Exactly. We got hold of a secret document that shows that Smotry, since he
*  took charge of the civil administration in the West Bank, stopped enforcing the law on illegal
*  settlements, illegal road, illegal infrastructure for the settlements, everything. It was brought
*  to an almost total freeze after October 7th, while the whole of Israel, the whole world,
*  were looking at Gaza. And then there is another yet secret letter that shows that the police
*  almost completely stopped answering calls from Palestinians to come to help them
*  when they are attacked by extreme settlers, following orders from the national security
*  minister, Itamar Ben-Gavir. So after October 7th, literally a Palestinian calls the police,
*  says their house is on fire, no response, on the direct orders of Ben-Gavir.
*  Yes, that's what the military, the Shin Beto, is saying in top classified documents. And on top of
*  that, the economy in the West Bank is just collapsing. Bet Salih Smotrich, in his first
*  hat as the Minister of Finance, is intentionally hobbling the economy of the Palestinians who live
*  in the West Bank. So one thing he does is not giving the Palestinians the tax revenues that
*  Israel collects for them, basically their money for goods that are being imported through the
*  airports and the seaports of Israel. This is something like 70% of the overall Palestinian
*  budget. And as if the economic situation in the West Bank was not horrible enough, the 150,000
*  Palestinians that had permit to go to Israel to work and bring a lot of money back home,
*  they cannot go back because Minister Smotrich, after the war, forbids them. And so they don't
*  bring back the money that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians depend on. And then this summer,
*  Ben-Gavir, so the Minister of National Security, visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and led
*  public prayer on camera. Now, that may not seem like a huge provocation to do, but in fact it is.
*  To Muslims, this is one of the most holiest sites in the world. And the current agreement is that
*  Jews are forbidden to pray in this place. And so doing that on the mountain is a huge provocation,
*  and everybody understands that. Certainly Ben-Gavir understands that. He knows that this could incite
*  a war all on its own. In the past, so much blood has been shed over the years for such provocations.
*  Lyle
*  Ronin, the destruction of Palestinian villages, violence by extreme settlers,
*  deliberate provocations by leaders themselves. This all sounds like it's designed to cause an
*  explosion. Exactly. So just this past August, a bomb blast in Tel Aviv late on Sunday has been
*  confirmed as a terrorist attack. The Palestinian blew himself up in central Tel Aviv. The man
*  carrying the bomb, which exploded near a synagogue, was killed and a passerby was injured.
*  This was the first suicide bombing inside Israel in the almost last decade. And then in late August,
*  partially in reaction to this suicide bomber, the Israeli military says it launched a large
*  counter-terror operation overnight in two refugee camps. The Israeli army did the 10-day raid in
*  Jenin, a Palestinian city in the West Bank. It was one of the most extensive and deadly raids
*  in the West Bank in years. The Israeli army said it killed 14 militants and detained 30 others who
*  were part of a militant group or planning attacks of different kinds. But of course, there was also
*  extensive other damage done. People are describing the destruction left by the Israeli military here
*  as an earthquake. Everything here is ripped up. Innocent civilians were killed, of course,
*  quite a lot of physical destruction in the city. And so the cycle of violence begins once again.
*  Ronan, do you think this is the beginning of the third Intifada?
*  Ronan Meiris It's a very, very good question.
*  And it's not a question just that you, Sabrina, and I are asking. Many Israeli officials are
*  asking themselves and their colleagues that question with great concern.
*  There are more and more signs indicating a third Intifada is coming. But unlike in other
*  times of crisis that occurred since the end of the second Intifada two decades ago,
*  that every time these signs were picked up, people were very concerned. And the Israeli
*  administration, government, defense establishment, ministers, cabinet, all rallied in order to try
*  to lower the flame, to do something to stop the possible explosion. Now, while the defense
*  establishment is alerting, is telling everybody, listen, we are on the brink, there are government
*  officials, cabinet ministers that are looking at the same signs, but they're not concerned. They're
*  happy. They are looking for an Intifada, for explosion, for havoc. So Sabrina, to answer
*  your question, I don't know. But it seems reasonable that we look back at the last couple of
*  months and say, yes, that was the beginning of a third Intifada. Sabrina
*  Dornan So when you said at the beginning of our conversation, Ronan, that this escalation
*  is a result of the decades long rise of the extreme right, this is what you meant. The people who have
*  always said that they want to control all of the land are now in power and willing to plunge the
*  country into more and more violence to get it. Ronan Meiris
*  Exactly. Sabrina Dornan
*  And no one seems willing or able to stop them. Ronan Meiris
*  Well, so there was a letter from the head of the Shin Bet, which was sent in the last few weeks to
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and other top government officials. That letter I wish I saw and was later
*  also reported in the Israeli media. Sabrina, this was one of the most severe letters I have ever read
*  coming from the ranks of the intelligence community in Israel. He wrote that the Jewish
*  terrorism that we are seeing in the West Bank these days is, quote, a great stain on Judaism
*  and on all of us. That it will cause, quote, global delegitimization even among our best friends,
*  meaning our allies around the world. And also that this settler violence poses a serious security
*  threat for all of Israel and that going in this direction, so the escalation of Jewish terrorism,
*  will, quote, lead to much bloodshed and will change beyond recognition the face of Israel
*  as we know and sacrifice for it over the years. So Netanyahu and other officials should understand
*  how bad things are, how dire the situation is. But will anything change if the power lies in the
*  their alliance with people like Ben Gver and Smotrich? Probably not. And people in Israel,
*  so Israeli citizens who didn't know, who didn't want to know what's happening over there
*  behind the fence are all shocked. But if they would just look behind the fence,
*  then nothing of all of that should have been a surprise.
*  So I think what we have learned is almost the obvious, but now it's so clear that when you
*  forgive for small offenses of criminal activity, of violence and looting and intimidating against
*  Palestinians, when you give full impunity to more and more severe violence and terrorism against
*  Palestinians, you end with more violence, more impunity, and you end with people who support
*  or took part of it in the coalition, the lawless became the law. And I think that what Mark Mazetti
*  and Nathan Odenheimer and myself attempted to do in this report was to do something very simple,
*  to put a mirror in front of a reality that nobody wanted to look at. And I hope that when bringing
*  some of that knowledge, when showing the world, but also the Israeli public, what is happening
*  behind that fence, the impunity, the total disregard of the law, if this is not stopped,
*  then the whole of the Israeli project is under great, great jeopardy.
*  And it will sentence this region to live on its sword for many, many, many years.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  In Lebanon on Tuesday, hundreds of pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah exploded
*  simultaneously in a highly coordinated attack that killed at least 11 people and injured more than
*  2,800. Three of the 11 people killed were civilians, two children, and a first aid worker.
*  Hospitals were inundated with the injured who had wounds on their faces, hands, and stomachs.
*  American and other officials said Israel was responsible for the attack and had executed it
*  by hiding small amounts of explosive material in each pager before the devices reached Lebanon
*  on their way from Taiwan, where they were made. Hezbollah operatives have long used pagers instead
*  of phones to make it harder for their messages to be intercepted. The practice became more
*  widespread after the October 7th attacks, when Hezbollah began firing into Israeli territory
*  in solidarity with its ally Hamas. Today's episode was produced by Ricky Nowitzki
