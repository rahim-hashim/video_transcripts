# How A Paradise Became A Death Trap: An Update
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp4Ty9hpAqI)
*  Hey, it's Sabrina.
*  This week, The Daily is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of the year, listening
*  back and then hearing what's happened in the time since they first ran.
*  Today, the fire that devastated Lahaina, Hawaii in August, and one man's story of surviving
*  it.
*  It's Tuesday, December 26th.
*  Hello?
*  Hi, is this Idris?
*  Yes, it is.
*  Hi.
*  Idris, thank you for taking the time to talk to us.
*  I wonder, Idris, if you could introduce yourself for me.
*  Tell me your name, your age, where you live, and what your profession is.
*  My name is Idris Noara.
*  I'm 32 years old.
*  I lived on Prison Street in Maui, Lahaina, and I was the manager of a Hilton property
*  at the beach and pool, working sales.
*  Got it.
*  And I wonder if you could start by telling us just kind of from the beginning, how your
*  day started.
*  So, actually, it was my first true day off in a long time.
*  I woke up in the middle of the night, which was Monday night, Tuesday morning, around
*  3 or 4 a.m. when we lost power.
*  So, it got pretty hot.
*  So, I opened up the windows, and by the time I woke up around 6, 7 a.m., I noticed we didn't
*  have service neither.
*  Self-service.
*  Yeah.
*  And honestly, I was just annoyed.
*  I was like, I've been waiting for this day off forever, and no power.
*  We didn't even know it was a hurricane.
*  We just thought it was windy.
*  And were you aware of the fire at that point?
*  Absolutely not.
*  There was no fire in the morning that I was aware of.
*  We had no warnings at all.
*  And so, I think it was around noon or 1, one of my neighbors came and knocked on my door
*  and he said, hey, you need to come out and see this.
*  So, I came out, and in front of my house, you know, I have a little cottage.
*  Behind my house, I could see a lot of smoke.
*  So, I called my cat, an outdoor cat, and I called her and I couldn't find her all day.
*  And then I just gave up, and I closed my door.
*  And then my neighbor came back, maybe an hour later, and he said, there's another fire.
*  And it was closer.
*  He's actually the street behind us.
*  And I have a scooter.
*  So, I actually went to go check out how close the fire was.
*  And I got on Front Street, which is a street that goes along the ocean.
*  And I see there's this restaurant up in flames.
*  And I saw people running.
*  And straight in front of me, there's a medical center.
*  And I remember actually seeing a lot of people trying to get in the medical center.
*  Then behind me, there's a whole business on fire.
*  It's like, holy, like, everything was on fire.
*  Like, I didn't understand how things started to catch on fire.
*  It didn't make sense.
*  And now I started to panic.
*  So, I went back to the neighbors, but the neighbors were all gone.
*  And I felt kind of lost.
*  And the wind, you know, there was wind and it was trees falling down.
*  And I screamed for my cat.
*  And I saw her run under the house, and she didn't want to come out.
*  You know, so I was panicking.
*  You know, reality started to set in.
*  And so I said, OK, maybe, you know, the safest place to be right now is here
*  because I wouldn't even know where to go.
*  And so I'm closing the door.
*  And about five minutes, everything turned black outside.
*  And a medical center across the street was up in flames to the sky.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And I couldn't understand.
*  I said, how?
*  Like, I just saw people.
*  Like, it was there was nothing like five, ten minutes ago.
*  And it really looked like someone put gasoline all over the building
*  and he just like took up and said, it didn't make sense.
*  How like a stone building burn so fast.
*  And so I opened the door, still calling my cat,
*  and I felt something burning on my shoulder and it was debris like amber.
*  And I look up in the sky and there's a very fire coming down the sky.
*  It was raining fire.
*  And now I have to get out of here.
*  And so, you know, I got everything I could, you know, all the necessities,
*  clothes and wallet and pictures or whatever, and put everything in two big bags.
*  And I ran out of the house.
*  And as I ran out of the house, there was smoke everywhere.
*  And I saw one of my neighbors
*  coughing, he's right in front of the house, and he was just coughing.
*  And I said, what are you doing here?
*  It's like, oh, I went to the store and I said, OK,
*  let's get on my scooter.
*  So he came behind me on my scooter and the fire came from uphill.
*  It was coming down.
*  So to me, the safest place that this fire is water.
*  And so, you know, in the panic, I said we have to go to the harbor.
*  And then we get on the front street.
*  And on front street, I was just chaos.
*  I could hear, you know, screams.
*  And then I can see people, but I could hear them scream, scary screams,
*  screams of pain I've never heard before.
*  There were clearly people burning alive.
*  Like it was a deep pain, you know, and people throwing up.
*  And it was just it was horrifying.
*  It was horrifying to hear that.
*  I'm so glad I can see it was so it was black.
*  There's so much smoke, but we could clearly hear them all around us.
*  All around us.
*  It felt like we were in hell.
*  We'll be right back.
*  The wind itself, the wind was the scariest thing.
*  The wind was so hot, it was burning us in.
*  It was so strong because everything was on fire.
*  And I told Damon, you got to tell me when to turn to the harbor,
*  because I can't see nothing.
*  And so we finally got to the harbor.
*  And I left my scooter there and at the edge of the water on the harbor,
*  there's a little little house, a little it's called the Harbor Masters Hut.
*  So we had our back against the wall and we were facing the ocean
*  and we're just waiting.
*  We just didn't know what to do.
*  Did you say anything to him?
*  No, we were not talking.
*  We didn't know.
*  I mean, in my mind, I'm like, OK, we're going to wait here.
*  At least like we're not going to burn.
*  That's what I was thinking.
*  That's what I was thinking.
*  But a couple of minutes waiting there,
*  I saw a shadow just run and jump in the water on the side of the house.
*  And I said, Damon, do you see this?
*  And we look in the water, the big people just drowning in front of us.
*  You know, he had the big head and yellow eyes and I didn't I want to help him,
*  but I didn't know if he was going to bite me or pulling with him in the water.
*  You know, so I kept calling him and calling him, but he couldn't do it.
*  He tried his best to do it, but he couldn't do it.
*  And I'll never forget the look he gave me in his eyes.
*  He just gave up and his head were underwater.
*  And I told Damon to hold my feet and I took my shirt off.
*  And I somehow managed to grab by the collar and pull him out.
*  And we tried to calm him down.
*  He was just walking in circles.
*  He was in panic mode.
*  And then I called the police and I said, hey, we're on the harbor.
*  We're stuck. You just have to come get us.
*  And the lady was just didn't know what to say.
*  She said, I'm sorry, we can't come get you.
*  Everything was in flames and they were overwhelmed.
*  I hung up and I just remember seeing debris falling from the sky
*  and our bags kept catching on fire.
*  Miraculously, I saw my phone.
*  I had one bar of service.
*  So I try to call my best friend, Yacine, and I told my best friend,
*  hey, I love you.
*  Tell everybody I love them.
*  It's going to be OK.
*  You know, here's my mom's number.
*  Don't call her now. Wait, you know, let her sleep.
*  Were you preparing because you thought you might not make it?
*  Oh, yeah, we didn't think we were going to make it.
*  And after I hung up with him, I called the police again.
*  And she gave me the same answer.
*  She said, I'm so sorry.
*  And, you know, I could feel the frustration in her voice.
*  She was just helpless. She didn't know.
*  And I felt so bad for her because she probably had so many calls like this.
*  And so I hung up again and I was just frustrated.
*  So at this point, I thought maybe I could get in the harbor.
*  Masters had the little house.
*  Damon had a knife with him and he cut the screen off.
*  And I start punching the window with all my strength, all my strength.
*  And so I fractured my hand.
*  The window was so thick, you wouldn't even do anything.
*  And so I called the police a third time.
*  And I said, if you guys don't come right now, we're going to die.
*  And she said, you guys have to jump in the water.
*  You guys have to jump in the water.
*  And I said, no way.
*  You want to jump in a hurricane?
*  At night, like with all this smoke, like there's no way we can jump.
*  The water was crazy.
*  And she said, you have no choice.
*  You have to jump in the water.
*  And I hung up and I looked at Damon like we have to jump.
*  And Damon said, there's no way I'm jumping.
*  I'm not jumping.
*  And I told him, listen, either we burn or we drown.
*  And, you know, I waited a couple more minutes.
*  I tried to convince him and I said, you know, I'm jumping.
*  There are rocks maybe 100 feet away, 150 feet.
*  And I finally made it.
*  And I looked back and I screamed at Damon and he was just terrified.
*  He was not, you know, he was next to the dog.
*  And I told him jump and I kept screaming and he just didn't want to.
*  And I could see him hanging onto the harbor with half his body in the water.
*  And I kept screaming, you need to let go.
*  You need to let go.
*  And he screamed, my shoes are too heavy.
*  And so I just made the decision to jump and go get him.
*  So I got back in the water and I got back next to him.
*  I tried to go and take his shoes off, but I can't even find his feet.
*  The ocean was just pushing me against the wall.
*  And I, and I, I took him to the water.
*  And I told him, you have to follow me.
*  I see.
*  And the way he was swimming, I said, there's no way he's going to make it.
*  He was just struggling, just swelling water and coughing and somehow he managed
*  to get very close to the rock and I pulled him up.
*  You know, he's overweight and he's older.
*  It was a miracle.
*  And, you know, we still had debris falling on us and we had waves just coming over us.
*  We were holding onto the rocks to not like get pulled or stuck in by the ocean.
*  It was just, it was just, it was just, it was just, it was just,
*  a nightmare.
*  And then I heard a dog screaming.
*  So I was like, I have to go back and I jumped back in the water.
*  You know, I try to get back on the Harbor.
*  He was laying against the wall.
*  His eyes closed and just screaming.
*  There's no way I could care.
*  I was a big pit bull and I had one, you know, my hand was fractured or broken.
*  So I thought if I, if I try to grab him in the water, he's already freaked out.
*  He, we're both going to drown, you know, he's going to die for sure.
*  And I'm probably not going to make it.
*  So one of my bags, I had a blanket and I dipped it in the ocean five or six times
*  and I put it on top of the dog.
*  That's all I could do.
*  And I took one of my bags and I, and I jumped back in the ocean.
*  And then I almost drowned.
*  I was just so exhausted and I panicked halfway.
*  And I was praying to God, please help me.
*  And, and I thank God I made it to the jetty and I went back on the other side.
*  And I talked to Damon and he was not answering, you know, grab his hand.
*  He, he just held my hand.
*  He was just in shock.
*  And then maybe an hour after that, I saw light at, you know, far away.
*  And I told Damon, I said, Hey, I think there's a boat over there.
*  And we're like screaming.
*  I was screaming at the top of my lungs and they were like coming towards like,
*  thank God.
*  And it was the, the code guard and they were like, we can't get close.
*  You guys have to jump in the water, you know, because it was so rough.
*  They were crashing the rocks and I jumped first and they got me in.
*  I just laid down on my back and I could just see Amber just falling on us.
*  Like the sky had no starts.
*  The Amber was the stars, red stars in the sky.
*  That's what it looks like.
*  Just a black sky with red stars.
*  It was falling down.
*  I was flying on the ocean, but I felt like I was floating in space.
*  I was thanking God.
*  I said, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  I don't deserve this.
*  I really just, it was just unbelievable that we made it.
*  And Damon, he managed to make it.
*  And I was like, thank God we made it.
*  And I said, oh, how'd you guys find us?
*  And they said, we got a call that someone might be on the Harbor.
*  So I think that lady, you know, she relayed the call and finally got to us.
*  And I said, thank God we made it.
*  And he said, oh no, not yet.
*  We still have to go through the storm.
*  And I said, where are we going?
*  And he said, we don't know.
*  Everything's on fire.
*  And I looked behind me and there was just, it was just, it looked like war.
*  It was just planes up to the sky.
*  The whole, I mean, the whole town and the, and the darkness.
*  So we got to Maui high school.
*  They made a shelter there.
*  And then when we arrived, of course we were like covered in suits and all black.
*  So anyone was looking at us and I was barefoot.
*  So people kept turning my feet.
*  Everybody knew, you know, we're the ones who survived.
*  You know, everybody that was in the shelter or the lucky ones.
*  After the break, senior producer, Lindsay Garrison shares an update on Idris,
*  a survivor of La Jueña's fire.
*  It's still very fresh.
*  They already honestly till this day, it feels like it was yesterday.
*  You know, I'm at a hotel and no one knows what happened.
*  And I'm like, I don't know.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  And no one knows what's next actually.
*  I called Idris back in late November.
*  He talked to me from a hotel.
*  He said he'd been living in hotels for more than three months, waiting for
*  FEMA to secure him an apartment.
*  Have you been moved from hotel to hotel since we talked?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  How many hotels?
*  Yeah.
*  Two, and I actually aimed up because they made a mistake and I
*  aimed up homeless for a night.
*  So yeah, it's been hard for everyone.
*  And I'm not blaming FEMA or, you know, I know they don't know, but it's
*  still very hard for us and it's really hard to live in a hotel room for that long.
*  You know, eating McDonald's every day.
*  Not the most, uh, best lifestyle.
*  And also like if you leave your hotel room for more than two or three
*  days, then you lose that room.
*  You know, so you can't even go and visit family.
*  You can't do anything.
*  It really feels like we're in jail.
*  Do you do anything to give yourself some relief from just feeling stuck?
*  Oh, she don't want to know.
*  Absolutely nothing.
*  I'm just in my room every day.
*  You know, everyone at this place, some of my friends are on the other side
*  and you're like, you know, you don't have a car and you know, it's kind of
*  hard to go to the beach by yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a weird feeling.
*  And, you know, I have multiple friends that I moved, love their job, love their
*  homes. I personally love my job as well because I was, I'm this place and, you
*  know, a lot of us are still mourning and, you know, they're still in shock and
*  they're reopened for tourists.
*  But it's kind of like attending a funeral and you having a party next door.
*  Like you're walking and everyone's happy and everyone's drinking and, you know,
*  and music and you're there and you feel like a ghost.
*  Like not really in the mood.
*  So it's a weird feeling.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going to be a long time before behind, I guess, back to how it was.
*  It's never going to be how it was.
*  Did you ever find anything out about the pit bull that you tried to save?
*  No.
*  So my cat is still missing and then the pit bull is still missing.
*  I still have a little hope.
*  I know my friend, they just found her cat like a week ago.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  They're still finding a lot of pets.
*  So I don't know if my cat was as fortunate, but people are telling me not to lose hope.
*  I hope they both turn up.
*  Me too.
*  Me too.
*  I really hope so.
*  Yeah.
*  Can you sort of envision what your ideal future or your ideal life would look like there in the coming months?
*  It's hard because I was living my dream before all this happened.
*  So it's hard for me to like think of a better situation that I had before, you know, but
*  I think my hope would be, you know, to get my place and hopefully find my cat and then start moving on from there.
*  It's just, it's kind of hard right now to imagine about anything.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the hardest part.
*  The hardest thing is not to know.
*  Today's episode was produced by Lindsay Garrison and Sydney Harper.
*  It was edited by Liz O'Balin and Michael Benoit with help from Lexi Diao.
*  Contains original music by Marian Lozano, Rowan Niemesto, and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
