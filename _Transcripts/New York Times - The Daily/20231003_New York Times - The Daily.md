# Sam Bankman-Fried Goes on Trial
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjol6xAiF5c)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  Sam Bankman Fried, the fallen golden boy of crypto, goes on trial starting today for what
*  prosecutors say was the largest financial fraud in recent history.
*  My colleague David Yaffe Bellamy on the trial of the man who was supposed to save crypto
*  and what its verdict could tell us about why he did it.
*  It's Tuesday, October 3rd.
*  David, welcome back to the show.
*  Thanks so much for having me.
*  So the last time you were on the show, David, that was almost 10 months ago, we talked about
*  the spectacular rise and pretty incredible fall of the crypto firm FTX and of course
*  its founder, Sam Bankman Fried.
*  And as a way to remind people, FTX and Bankman Fried weren't just another crypto firm.
*  They were the crypto firm that was going to legitimize crypto, make it mainstream.
*  But then it turned out that what we thought was the success and this example, this model,
*  was actually smoke and mirrors.
*  Yeah, to refresh all your memories, Sam Bankman Fried was the kind of figurehead of the crypto
*  industry.
*  The Michael Jordan of crypto, if you will.
*  His parents were Stanford Law professors.
*  He had this kind of fancy academic background.
*  He drives a Toyota Corolla to FTX's offices in the Bahamas.
*  He lives with 10 roommates and a goldendoodle named Gopher.
*  And he was saying all the right things.
*  Maybe I should try earning a gift, which is to say, try seeing how much I could get to
*  be able to donate.
*  Ten years ago when he was in college, he decided that he wanted to dedicate his life to doing
*  good for the world.
*  He had this sort of veneer of ethics.
*  He was this guy who was going to make crypto clean.
*  I think what this highlights is the need for federal oversight of the cryptocurrency industry.
*  He was going to turn it into something that could help everyday Americans and that would
*  provide this sort of useful alternative to the inefficiencies and the inequalities of
*  the traditional financial system.
*  Meme stocks and cryptocurrency allowing several millennials to make a splashy debut on the
*  Forbes 400.
*  And that whole project also made him extremely rich.
*  The FTX founder is now worth an estimated $11 billion.
*  He was worth billions and billions of dollars.
*  He was donating to politicians.
*  He lived in a fancy penthouse of the Bahamas.
*  Nobody has ever gotten that rich, that young, except for Mark Zuckerberg.
*  And then everything changed for him very quickly.
*  Does appear that they are filing chapter 11 at FTX.
*  FTX went from a $32 billion company to bankruptcy in the matter of just four days or so.
*  There's so much we don't know.
*  Well, here's what we know.
*  He's broke.
*  And he's in big trouble.
*  He's in big trouble.
*  He was arrested in his luxurious penthouse in the Bahamas where he and his colleagues
*  had lived for the past year and a half and quickly extradited to the United States to
*  face the charges.
*  And he tweeted this morning, he says, I'm really sorry again that we ended up here.
*  Hopefully things can find a way to recover.
*  And he was charged by the federal government in the US with a series of very serious financial
*  crimes.
*  And remind us what exactly Sam Bankman Fried was charged with.
*  The prosecutors charged him with things like wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.
*  But what the charges really boil down to is that he misused his customers' money.
*  And remember, FTX is a crypto exchange.
*  It's the place that everyday investors go where they can deposit their dollars and use
*  those dollars to buy different types of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
*  But it's also kind of like a bank.
*  They keep their dollars and their Bitcoin and their other crypto on the platform and
*  effectively in the possession of Sam Bankman Fried.
*  And they assume that when they come back and want it, it will be there.
*  Exactly.
*  And what Sam is accused of doing is taking that money and instead of keeping it for his
*  customers, spending it on all sorts of things.
*  Donations to politicians, charitable contributions, investments in other companies, even luxury
*  real estate purchases in the Bahamas.
*  And what the prosecutor says that the mechanism for this was that Sam would transfer this
*  money over from FTX to a related hedge fund that he also ran called Alameda Research.
*  In theory, Alameda was just another customer that could trade cryptocurrencies on FTX.
*  But in reality, the companies were deeply entangled.
*  Sam and his friends ran this whole business empire together.
*  The CEO of Alameda, who is handpicked by Sam, was his on and off girlfriend, Caroline Ellison.
*  Caroline also lived with him in a penthouse in the Bahamas with eight other FTX executives.
*  The Alameda offices were in the same areas, the FTX offices.
*  In public, Sam and Caroline would insist that there was a wall separating the two companies.
*  But as we've learned more about it, it's become clear that was a complete fiction.
*  I mean, pretty cozy relationship, quite literally, between these two companies.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And this actually ended up becoming the seeds of the downfall of the whole business empire.
*  Because in the middle of last year, when the crypto market entered a steep decline, Alameda
*  started losing money.
*  It was a hedge fund and it made a number of bad bets.
*  Before long, there was a giant hole in Alameda's accounts.
*  And we're not talking about just some minor financial difficulties here.
*  We're talking about a hole on the scale of $8 billion.
*  Crazy.
*  And the leadership of the FTX Alameda empire started looking for ways to solve that problem.
*  And what prosecutors say they ultimately did was fill the hole in Alameda's accounts with
*  customer funds from FTX.
*  OK, so huge hole.
*  And when customers go to retrieve their money, it wasn't there.
*  It had gone out the door through a secret trap door, according to prosecutors, to Alameda.
*  On paper, it's a totally different company.
*  But in practice, it's a company whose fortunes completely depended on FTX.
*  Exactly.
*  There was a classic bank run scenario, kind of frantic three or four days where everybody
*  was trying to withdraw their money and it just wasn't there.
*  Eventually, FTX had to shut down withdrawals and a couple days later, it was filing for
*  bankruptcy.
*  And the prosecutors say this was an intentional fraud, that FTX and Alameda had been set up
*  so that Alameda could effectively steal customers' deposits and that Sam and his closest lieutenants
*  had defrauded investors in the companies, defrauded lenders, and of course, defrauded
*  customers as well.
*  Those are very, very serious crimes.
*  If Sam Bankman Fried is convicted, he could face decades in prison.
*  What would amount to a life sentence?
*  Okay.
*  So at a high level, according to prosecutors, this was actually a plot.
*  It wasn't some accounting error or just bad business luck.
*  It was a conspiracy.
*  And as we know from other cases like this, unraveling these kinds of schemes can take
*  years of painful financial forensics.
*  Yet prosecutors in this case charged him really quickly.
*  You said within weeks.
*  How did that work?
*  So the crucial break that prosecutors got is that they convinced several close colleagues
*  of Sam Bankman Fried to flip on him.
*  And those colleagues were under enormous pressure.
*  They were facing charges with the potential to lead to decades in prison.
*  But they weren't the main target.
*  Sam was.
*  And so they flipped.
*  Caroline Ellison, the Alameda chief executive who's Sam's ex-girlfriend, she pleads guilty,
*  says I participated in a criminal conspiracy with this guy.
*  Another top executive at FTX, actually one of the co-founders of the exchange, a guy
*  who Sam had known since high school math camp, also flipped.
*  And then there was a third guilty plea from another top executive, someone who'd known
*  Sam and his family for years.
*  He was the best friend of Sam's younger brother.
*  And between the three of them, that gave the prosecutors the ability to sort of bring this
*  case very, very quickly.
*  And so that basically means that they decided to be witnesses for the prosecution, to testify
*  against their friend in court.
*  Exactly.
*  His best friends, his closest professional colleagues standing up and saying this guy
*  is guilty.
*  It's this kind of incredibly dramatic dynamic of friends turning against friends.
*  But Sam pleads not guilty, insists that he's innocent, and vows to fight the charges.
*  Okay, so he's back in the U.S. and he's going to fight.
*  Exactly.
*  And instead of getting thrown in jail, he's released on bail.
*  And Sam sort of settles into a relatively comfortable existence.
*  He's under house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor.
*  And under house arrest, Sam spends a lot of time working on his legal defense.
*  But he's also working on his image in advance of the trial.
*  And we actually have a lot of insight into how he was thinking about defending himself.
*  Because while he was under house arrest, he started writing.
*  And he wrote a kind of series of treatises that run to more than 250 pages on Google
*  Docs, including one long one that took the form of a giant self-justifying Twitter thread,
*  which he never posted, but which is full of various legal defenses and justifications
*  for his actions.
*  And what did he say?
*  So at one point, and I think this is probably the best example of his mindset, he says,
*  quote, I'm broke and wearing an ankle monitor and one of the most hated people in the world.
*  And the truth is that I did what I thought was right.
*  It doesn't really sound like the words of someone who's contrite.
*  No, and this was definitely part of his strategy.
*  You know, he would be a little bit kind of self-flagellating and take some blame,
*  but ultimately shift responsibility onto others as well.
*  And that was a narrative that he was advancing all the time while he was under house arrest,
*  meeting with reporters, inviting other guests, and really trying to sort of replace the image
*  that people had in their minds of him.
*  Right. I remember from our last episode, he spent a lot of time
*  talking to reporters.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I mean, he talked to reporters all the time and that actually continued during his house arrest.
*  And in fact, last summer, I took a trip of my own to his parents' house in Palo Alto.
*  What house?
*  Kind of a surreal experience.
*  They live in this sort of quiet suburban neighborhood, but there was a security guard out front
*  who had to collect my phone on the way in.
*  That was part of his bail conditions that nobody could bring a kind of internet-connected device
*  into the house.
*  And I walked in the front door.
*  I think one of his parents actually opened the door for me and met with him.
*  So this is pretty incredible.
*  You're going to meet him and talk with him in person, this man under indictment,
*  whose every move could come back to haunt him in court.
*  What'd you guys talk about?
*  You know, we talked about a lot of things, and most of the meeting was off the record.
*  So obviously, I can't go into all the details of that.
*  But one significant thing he did, which he later made public,
*  is that he shared with me private writings written by his ex-girlfriend, Caroline Ellison,
*  who of course is also a crucial witness for the prosecution.
*  She and Sam would communicate using Google Docs, writing long messages that were sent back and forth.
*  And so these documents were kind of very raw personal reflections,
*  not just like short emails or text messages, but like pages and pages of sort of diary-like reflections
*  addressed to him.
*  And the writings are just very sad.
*  They're the reflections of somebody who is deeply insecure.
*  She expresses concerns about her own ability to run a company as successful and big and important as Alameda.
*  She expresses all sorts of insecurities about her relationship with Sam,
*  talks about how difficult it is to work with somebody that she's recently broken up with,
*  how difficult it is to hear people praising him all the time.
*  It's really a window into the mind of somebody who is incredibly unhappy for the, you know,
*  nine months to a year leading up to her guilty plea.
*  So he gives you the private writings of his girlfriend, who's also someone accused in the case.
*  Why would he do that?
*  You know, obviously I can't read his mind and figure out exactly what he was intending.
*  But one thing we know about this guy is he's someone who's constantly trying to shape PR narratives
*  about himself and about what happened.
*  And I think it's fair to assume that he saw some sort of benefit from getting this information out.
*  So that is a real legally risky move for him, right?
*  It was certainly very risky.
*  I mean, the legal backdrop to this is that twice already during his house arrest,
*  he'd pushed the limits of what he was allowed to do.
*  First, he tried to contact another witness in the case, sending a message that basically said,
*  hey, let's talk and get on the same page.
*  And he'd also used a virtual private network to access the Internet,
*  a sort of secret way to navigate the web.
*  And these two incidents were seen by prosecutors as examples of Sam behaving in a way that was sneaky
*  and manipulative and seemed as if he was trying to evade their scrutiny.
*  And the judge basically agreed and said, hey, you've got two strikes here.
*  If you cross me one more time, I'm going to throw you in jail.
*  And that's exactly what ended up happening.
*  After I got a hold of those documents that Caroline had written,
*  we immediately decided that they were worth publishing because they provided a window
*  into the thought process of someone who'd pleaded guilty to a massive fraud.
*  So we put them out there and they were sourced anonymously.
*  We didn't say where we'd gotten them.
*  But once the story was published, the prosecutors became furious.
*  And the defense lawyers immediately admitted that Sam had been the source.
*  It's not totally clear why, but in the end, the judge said, this is enough.
*  He had essentially tried to intimidate witnesses in the case
*  and he could no longer remain free.
*  Oh, wow.
*  So in August, he traveled from his home in Palo Alto to court in New York
*  because bail was revoked and he was immediately taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center
*  in Brooklyn, which is this notorious jail where federal defendants are held
*  that's had all sorts of complaints over the years, you know, heating problems,
*  staffing shortages, you name it.
*  And he's had a hard time.
*  He's a vegan and his lawyers complained in court that he hasn't been able to eat
*  vegan food.
*  He's essentially been surviving on bread, water and peanut butter.
*  And he also, you know, more importantly, sort of struggled to get medication
*  that he needed.
*  And he's also had a very hard time accessing documents that are important
*  to the case.
*  This is a really complicated white collar case with millions of pages of evidence
*  for him to review ahead of the trial.
*  And his lawyers have said, you know, the laptop that he was given couldn't connect
*  to the internet.
*  Its battery life wasn't long enough.
*  And he's effectively had no ability to prepare for trial.
*  So, David, listening to this whole saga, it really seems like this is the moment
*  when things are starting to become real for him.
*  Like, he was just this wonder boy who seemingly was able to get away with
*  everything.
*  He spent his bail at his parents' very nice California house, even talked to
*  reporters.
*  But when his bail is taken away and he goes to this Brooklyn jail, this would seem
*  to be the time that reality does start to sink in.
*  Jail is not a nice place to be.
*  And for the first time, he's really not in control.
*  Yeah, I think that's fair.
*  Going to jail in New York is one of the most serious tastes of a major consequence
*  that Sam Bankman Fried has faced as this is all played out.
*  And the thing is, it could be about to get even worse for him.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, David, Sam Bankman Fried is facing these really serious charges.
*  His trial is about to begin.
*  How are prosecutors in this case going to go about arguing that he intentionally
*  defrauded people, that this was in fact a conspiracy?
*  Almost from the moment FTX collapsed, the prosecutors started collecting huge
*  quantities of evidence.
*  They issued subpoenas to people who had worked for and with the company.
*  They gathered emails, text messages, spreadsheets with transaction data, Slack
*  exchanges that had happened within the company, all sort of illustrating how FTX
*  and Alameda operated.
*  And they ended up with a trove of more than 6 million documents that will help them
*  build their case.
*  And that's on top of the testimony that they've got from those three cooperating
*  witnesses who were really the three most powerful people in Sam's empire
*  underneath him.
*  And what's an example of something that they have actually found?
*  So remember that prosecutors have alleged in the charges that this money from FTX
*  went out a kind of back door to Alameda.
*  Prosecutors actually say they found the snippet of computer code that allowed this
*  to happen.
*  It was literally programmed into the system.
*  And the prosecutors say that bit of code, like a chain of numbers that wouldn't mean
*  anything to an average person, that that's how this crime was committed.
*  So basically, the computer of one secretly talks to the computer of the other, and
*  that's how the money went through.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And this is crucial because prosecutors have presented it as evidence of intent that
*  had to be programmed in deliberately.
*  Someone had to make a decision.
*  Let's put this piece of information in the code.
*  So the back door appears to be proof that it wasn't just an accounting error,
*  that money flowed from FTX to Alameda by design.
*  And it's not the only useful piece of evidence they've got.
*  They've got contemporaneous material.
*  They have notes that Caroline took during meetings with Sam.
*  And probably most important, they have a recording that somebody made of
*  a company-wide meeting, an Alameda staff meeting that Caroline held just as FTX
*  and Alameda were collapsing, where she explained to her employees,
*  this is what's happening.
*  A few months ago, we had this massive hole in our accounts.
*  We needed to fill it.
*  And Sam and I and a couple of other people authorized the decision to fill
*  that hole using customer funds.
*  And this recording sounds like an admission of guilt, and
*  it's pretty clearly gonna be a powerful bit of evidence in the courtroom.
*  Wow, I mean, it sounds kind of like a smoking gun.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  The prosecutors have made a big deal out of it.
*  They've posted the whole transcript of the recording in court filings.
*  And I think everyone who's followed the case closely is looking forward to
*  actually hearing the thing.
*  Okay, so that's the prosecution's case.
*  What defense will Sam Bankman Fried make?
*  It's not entirely clear yet.
*  But based on what his lawyers have indicated, there are a few possibilities.
*  One thing that Sam has said all along is that this was just a massive scrub,
*  that there was an accounting mix up at FTX.
*  He never had any idea that Alameda had taken this much money, and
*  there was no conspiracy at all.
*  It was just a mistake.
*  Another thing that Sam's been saying, though,
*  is that it was everyone else's fault.
*  In particular, he's tried to shift a lot of blame to Caroline,
*  the CEO of Alameda.
*  He's claimed he really didn't have much visibility into what was going on
*  that side of the business, and that, frankly, Caroline wasn't that good at
*  risk management, at making sure Alameda wasn't making dangerous bets that could
*  cost both companies money.
*  And he's also tried to blame lawyers that worked with FTX and
*  Alameda over the years.
*  He said, look, everything that we did at this company went through lawyers.
*  I was constantly getting authorization for basic business decisions, and
*  how could it be a crime if these legal professionals signed off?
*  What he said specifically is that two law firms that worked closely with FTX,
*  one's called Sullivan and Cromwell, the others Fenwick and West,
*  that those firms advised him super closely and
*  signed off on a lot of what he did.
*  And interestingly, Sullivan and
*  Cromwell's actually still very involved in this whole case.
*  After FTX collapsed, they were appointed to take over the bankruptcy, essentially,
*  do the work of trying to recover whatever funds could be recovered and
*  redistribute them to creditors.
*  And it's been incredibly profitable for them.
*  They've made something like $100 million.
*  And one thing that Sam has argued over and over again is that this whole notion
*  that he was at the forefront of a conspiracy is something that's partially
*  concocted by Sullivan and Cromwell.
*  He's complained that these lawyers are just setting him up as the fall guy,
*  maybe to protect themselves, to shield themselves from any kind of
*  legal responsibility.
*  Are any of these defenses expected to work?
*  I mean, you never know.
*  A jury's always a wild card, but most legal experts think that he's very likely
*  to lose this case for a lot of reason.
*  Partly it's those three cooperators.
*  Partly it's the fact that he's been sitting in jail as the case approaches.
*  But there is one other wild card here, which is that Sam might testify.
*  That's very unusual in these types of cases.
*  Defense lawyers almost always advise against it.
*  Then again, in a case like this, it could be sort of a useful hail Mary type move
*  by the defense.
*  Whenever a defendant testifies, it really changes the tone of the whole trial.
*  Suddenly, the jury becomes fixated on is this guy credible?
*  Do I believe what he's saying?
*  And if they don't, that's a problem for him.
*  If they don't, he's in big trouble.
*  But he might be banking on the fact that he has successfully charmed huge numbers
*  of people over the years and might think that he can do it again.
*  And we'll find out.
*  So David, stepping back for a minute here, this alleged scam doesn't seem like it really
*  had that much to do with crypto itself.
*  Like it's not about the blockchain, right?
*  It's just kind of old fashioned plain vanilla stealing people's money and lying about it.
*  That's what prosecutors are saying.
*  Yeah. And on one hand, that's true.
*  You don't have to understand the intricacies of Bitcoin to understand what happened
*  here.
*  Money that belonged to one person was taken and used for something else.
*  But I do think that simplifies the situation a little bit.
*  In a lot of ways, this case is all about crypto.
*  It's about a set of behaviors that was enabled because of the freewheeling lack of
*  regulation that has defined crypto for the last few years.
*  FTX was a company that was set up in the Bahamas partly because it wanted to avoid
*  stricter rules that other governments have.
*  It was enabled by all sorts of fancy experimental financial engineering that's really
*  proliferated in the world of crypto.
*  And the consequences from it have had a dramatic effect on the crypto industry.
*  The market crashed.
*  Prices have gone down.
*  Other crypto companies that were tied to FTX in all sorts of ways have faced major issues.
*  Some of them have even filed for bankruptcy.
*  And in response to this whole fiasco, the US government, including some politicians
*  who were taking money from Sam Bankman Fried not that long ago, has conducted a major
*  crackdown on the industry.
*  The Securities and Exchange Commission has sued a couple of big companies that were FTX's
*  major rivals.
*  And it's much, much harder to operate in the US as a crypto company now than it was before
*  FTX imploded.
*  It's funny, you know, we started this conversation talking about how Sam Bankman Fried wanted
*  to clean up the crypto industry.
*  And from what you've just described, he has, just not in the way that he might have expected.
*  Because FTX and its spectacular fall was really the catalyst in a lot of ways that is driving
*  the change the industry is experiencing right now.
*  So from all of the conversations you've had with people in the crypto world, David, what
*  are they saying to you about the trial?
*  What are they thinking right now?
*  So a lot of people in crypto are not happy that we're even talking about this.
*  They want us to forget about Sam Bankman Fried and just to move on.
*  I was actually at a dinner a few weeks ago with a bunch of crypto guys who, when I brought
*  up Sam Bankman Fried, said, oh, we haven't thought about him in months.
*  You know, we've totally moved on from this.
*  But there are other people in the industry who are watching this very closely and really
*  want to see Sam Bankman Fried convicted.
*  Why?
*  I mean, he's the paragon of crypto.
*  Why would they want him to be put in jail?
*  I mean, doesn't that say something bad about them?
*  I think it's a combination of things.
*  There's some genuine desire for vengeance, like a real bloodlust among the crypto boosters
*  who trusted this guy and then saw him basically taint the reputation of their entire industry.
*  But I think there's also a sense among some of these people that maybe if he gets convicted,
*  that will kind of close this chapter and offer this kind of moment of catharsis so
*  that the industry can really move on.
*  I mean, isn't that a little delusional?
*  I mean, to think that people are just going to forget everything that happened.
*  Oh, I think it's completely delusional.
*  For one thing, this trial is going to put a huge spotlight on the crypto industry and
*  on its worst behaviors for the next six weeks.
*  And that's going to be really embarrassing.
*  And then even after this case is over, regardless of what happens in the courtroom, there are
*  going to be Netflix documentaries and movies made about this.
*  It's just going to continue to occupy an important place in the public imagination.
*  No matter what happens, the story of FTX is going to linger for years and years.
*  And it's going to be a memory of how a guy who presented himself as crypto savior turned
*  out to be a fraud.
*  And for a lot of people, it's going to be a sign that he was leading an industry that's
*  full of frauds.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Monday, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida moved to oust Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy
*  from his post in an act of vengeance that posed the clearest threat yet to McCarthy's
*  tenure.
*  The move was a rare form of political punishment and, if it succeeds, could plunge the House
*  into chaos.
*  It came just days after McCarthy moved to avert a government shutdown by relying on
*  Democratic votes to push through a stopgap spending bill.
*  He did it over the objection of a block of hardliners in his own party, including Gaetz.
*  Under House rules, McCarthy will need to address the motion within two legislative days.
*  And, former President Donald Trump spent the day in court on Monday for the start of a
*  weeks-long civil trial in a lawsuit that could cost him control of Trump Tower and other
*  prized New York properties.
*  The suit, filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, charges that Trump committed
*  fraud by inflating the value of his assets.
*  James seeks a financial penalty and the trial, which is before a judge, not a jury, will
*  determine the size of that.
*  James also seeks to stop Trump from doing business in New York State.
*  The properties are currently in legal limbo pending the outcome of the trial.
*  On his way into the courtroom on Monday, Trump said James had charged him because he was
*  performing so well in the polls.
