# Will Republicans Reject Gaetz?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jbUuaR8YvI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  Last week, President-elect Donald Trump chose the firebrand congressman Matt Gaetz to be
*  his attorney general.
*  Blindsided, that's how many Senate Republicans feel by Donald Trump.
*  I was shocked that he has been nominated.
*  Trump's choice shocked Washington.
*  It must be the worst nomination for a cabinet position in American history.
*  And raised questions about whether the Senate would approve it.
*  He is entitled to his nomination, but he's not entitled to a confirmation of literally
*  any nominee.
*  Today, my colleague Robert Draper, on what the nomination reveals about Trump's promise
*  for retribution.
*  And how far Republicans are willing to go to help him get it.
*  It's Monday, November 18th.
*  Robert, welcome to The Daily.
*  Thanks for having me on.
*  And happy Sunday.
*  You as well.
*  So President-elect Donald Trump announced a series of pretty controversial nominations
*  for his cabinet last week.
*  Chief among them was Matt Gaetz, the hard right member of Congress from Florida for
*  attorney general.
*  Gaetz is someone you've written a lot about and we wanted to turn to you to talk about
*  this pick of Gaetz and why it's so controversial.
*  The pick is controversial, Sabrina, in part because of who Matt Gaetz is.
*  He comes from what I suppose you could say is the performance art wing of the Republican
*  Party, who's very adroit at getting attention, but someone who does not have an accomplished
*  track record as a legislator.
*  So he would seem to be not an altogether serious pick and not a particularly qualified one
*  as well.
*  But he's also controversial as a pick because of the particular office, the Department of
*  Justice, of course, he would be America's chief law enforcement officer, which is interesting
*  and ironic given that Gaetz himself has been defiant of the law, has had a trail of investigations
*  following him both on the federal level and within Congress.
*  And on top of that, the attorney general has tended to be an office that operates more
*  or less independently from the president.
*  The attorney general will often do things that might even offend the president, might
*  even investigate members of the administration.
*  So to pick someone like Matt Gaetz, who is an unflagging loyalist to Donald Trump, would
*  seem to suggest that the DOJ will, under Trump's presidency, become completely co-opted so
*  that a President Trump would himself be in many ways beyond the reach of the law.
*  So all of this sets in motion a showdown between Trump and the Republican Party writ large
*  and a test of whether or not the legislative branch will offer any kind of constraints
*  over that authority of his.
*  Okay, so let's talk about who Matt Gaetz is and how he became such an important figure
*  in Trump world.
*  Tell me about him.
*  Sure.
*  Matt Gaetz is from Northwestern Florida.
*  He grew up in a town called Niceville.
*  His father owned a chain of hospices that he ultimately sold in the early 2000s for
*  something like $400 million.
*  So wealthy family.
*  Very wealthy family.
*  His father found a second career in politics.
*  He ran for state Senate and won, ultimately becoming president of the Senate in the state
*  of Florida.
*  And the younger Gaetz, after being a high school debate champion, went on to college,
*  then got a law degree and joined a commercial litigation firm where he stayed for a couple
*  of years.
*  But then after that, joined the new family business of politics and ran for a vacant
*  seat in the state house of Florida in 2010.
*  So he pretty much immediately jumps into politics after being in this law practice.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And then Matt Gaetz ran for the first congressional district of Florida, his local congressional
*  seat, which is very conservative, very dominated by a couple of military bases.
*  And he ran, of course, at the same time that Donald Trump was running for president.
*  So this was the 2016 cycle.
*  This is when he gets to Congress.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Matt Gaetz was an early supporter of the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, but it did not
*  take terribly long before Bush was faltering in his debate performances and his fundraising
*  and in every other way against this outsider candidate, Donald Trump.
*  And Gaetz quickly threw in with him as well.
*  And why did he throw his lot in with Trump?
*  I think for a couple of reasons, Sabrina.
*  The first was that he was punching a winning ticket.
*  Though Trump was an outsider, he dominated the Republican primaries and really was at
*  the top of the polls.
*  And so it was evident that the center of gravity within the Republican Party was moving towards
*  Trump.
*  Gaetz could clearly see that.
*  But there was also a pugilistic streak to Trump that Gaetz himself, as a kind of resonant
*  smart aleck in his high school as a debate nerd, that he could very much identify with.
*  And Matt Gaetz himself, a guy who was given to sarcasm, was given to insults, was given
*  to be outside looking into the political establishment, found himself very much to be a kindred spirit
*  of Trump.
*  Just from the beginning of Trump's presidency.
*  Joining us now, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz.
*  Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz.
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz and Congressman Matt Gaetz represents the state of Florida.
*  He joins us.
*  Congressman, thanks a lot for coming on.
*  Matt Gaetz was on every conservative outlet, praising everything that Trump did.
*  I support this travel ban because I think it will enhance the security of Americans.
*  From the Muslim ban.
*  The foundation for Obamacare is crumbling, and that means we might be able to actually
*  start on health care worthy of the great people in this country.
*  To his attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare.
*  I think if you just look at the bias on the Mueller team, these are not people in search
*  of the truth.
*  They are people in search of an impeachment charge.
*  Everyone was still trying to take their measure of Trump, and he did not have a deep bench
*  of cheerleaders, but Matt Gaetz was unambiguously one of them.
*  Mr. President.
*  I think we won the day, sir.
*  Gaetz was frequently, as a result of this call on the phone by Trump, President Trump
*  would offer his thanks to Gaetz, and so it became this kind of self-licking ice cream
*  cone where Gaetz would say something, Trump would love it, Gaetz would want to please
*  him even more, and on and on and went.
*  So outside of these interviews and TV appearances, were there other ways that Gaetz was trying
*  to show his loyalty?
*  Yeah, I think the most flamboyant example occurred in 2019 when the House Intelligence
*  Committee was having an impeachment inquiry into Trump's conduct towards the president
*  of Ukraine and his apparent attempt to get President Zelensky to dig up dirt on Trump's
*  2020 opponent, Joe Biden.
*  So the Intelligence Committee was having this impeachment inquiry in a secure facility in
*  the basement of the Capitol.
*  Classified information was being discussed.
*  This was not something that just anybody could go into.
*  That includes any person who has a congressperson's badge.
*  Matt Gaetz led a group of about two dozen Republican members of Congress to this facility,
*  followed by a bunch of reporters.
*  I'm gathered here with dozens of my congressional colleagues underground in the basement of
*  the Capitol.
*  Standing outside the doors of this conference room that was secure, Gaetz and the others
*  proceeded to have an ad hoc press conference.
*  Because if behind those doors they intend to overturn the results of an American presidential
*  election, we want to know what's going on.
*  In which Gaetz talked about how outrageous it was that this sham investigation was taking
*  place against President Trump.
*  And then at the very end...
*  We're going to go and see if we can get inside.
*  So let's see if we can get in.
*  We're going in.
*  He said, okay, we're going in.
*  And they barged into the facility, effectively bringing the proceedings to a halt.
*  And the idea that any closed hearing would be disrupted by anybody was generally unheard
*  of.
*  But for an actual legislator, an actual member of Congress to storm in and start making accusations
*  that this was some sort of deep state undertaking where they were hatching up, damning testimony
*  from scratch, was without precedent.
*  And it showed just how far he was willing to go for Trump, it sounds like.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And another thing that I think stands out about Gaetz's support of Trump was in the
*  waning moments of Trump's presidency on January the 6th, when Matt Gaetz, far from expressing
*  outrage that Trump had stirred up the mob that had stormed the Capitol, was questioning
*  the composition of the mob itself and saying that these weren't Trump supporters.
*  These must be left wingers.
*  These are members of Antifa, the far left group that had been involved in protests,
*  not all of them peaceful protests during the summer of 2020, for example.
*  And we should say was pretty much conclusively not part of the riot at the Capitol on January 6th.
*  That's right.
*  There's more evidence to suggest that what took place at the Capitol on January the 6th
*  was instigated by, or even that there were Antifa participants in it.
*  But there was Gaetz from the get go, basically saying these couldn't be Trump supporters.
*  So then in the days to follow the January the 6th riot, there were calls to impeach
*  Donald Trump.
*  And while Gaetz did not say he should not be impeached and certainly did not say that
*  he should be impeached, he did immediately denounce those people who denounced Donald
*  Trump and called for his impeachment.
*  So Gaetz was one of the very first people to decry them, House Republican Conference
*  Chairwoman Liz Cheney, calling for Trump's impeachment.
*  And in fact, within a couple of weeks after Trump left office on January the 20th,
*  I love Wyoming!
*  There's Matt Gaetz on the steps of the Capitol of Wyoming.
*  I'll confess to you, this is my first time in Wyoming.
*  I've been here for about an hour and I feel like I already know the place a lot better
*  than your misguided representative Liz Cheney.
*  Leading a protest against the Congresswoman representing the state of Wyoming, Liz Cheney,
*  and saying that she's the one who needs to be pushed out.
*  The truth is that the establishment in both political parties have teamed up to screw
*  our fellow Americans for generations.
*  This is a very aggressive going after Trump's enemies.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  And of course, it's Matt Gaetz being clever enough recognizing that not all the facts
*  are in not to say Donald Trump absolutely did nothing wrong, but instead to say that
*  the people who are saying that Donald Trump did something wrong are themselves wrong.
*  So it's a kind of bank shot of denouncing denouncers that is the sort of thing that
*  the lawyerly Gaetz is a specialist in.
*  So this is a guy who's time and time again shown that he's willing to defend Trump at
*  all costs, which I guess answers the question of why Trump might want this guy as his attorney
*  general.
*  That's right.
*  Donald Trump was essentially setting himself up as the kind of person that Donald Trump
*  needed.
*  Someone who had his bombastic combative style, someone who was an unflagging loyalist, that's
*  the kind of guy Donald Trump would want to have around.
*  But something else is happening too, which is that Matt Gaetz is landing in hot water
*  and as a result of that needs Donald Trump at least as much as Donald Trump needs Matt Gaetz.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Robert, you said that Gaetz needs Trump in some ways just as much as Trump needs Gaetz.
*  Explain that.
*  Yes, Matt Gaetz was in trouble with the federal authorities and had been really since 2017
*  or so when he was a freshman member of Congress.
*  Here's what was taking place.
*  Gaetz had become friends with a guy named Joel Greenberg, who was kind of a political
*  gadfly with political ambitions of his own, was thinking of running for Congress, and
*  he'd collected a bunch of lobbyists and other political muckety mucks in Florida to hang
*  out with.
*  He would help throw these parties and Gaetz began to cavort around with Greenberg and
*  with Greenberg's friends to show up to these parties.
*  There would be recreational drugs of these parties.
*  There would be sex at these parties.
*  In addition to the lobbyists and elected officials, there would be women who were not of politics
*  who were there.
*  Some of them were from an escort service, and at least one of them was under the age
*  of 18.
*  This is what attracted the attention of the feds.
*  When Joel Greenberg was nabbed by federal authorities for a variety of things, including
*  having sex apparently with a 17-year-old girl, Greenberg pled guilty to this offense and
*  right away began to supply them with information to the effect that Gaetz was doing the same
*  thing.
*  So the feds began to conduct a federal inquiry into Gaetz, but ultimately they dropped the
*  case.
*  Why?
*  They dropped it apparently because of two things.
*  So they couldn't get enough information and the information that they could get was coming
*  from people who might not look so great before a jury, either because they were involved
*  in the crimes themselves or had criminal records of their own.
*  And so it just became a heavy lift.
*  This is informed speculation, Sabrina, because the reality is that the Department of Justice
*  never announced, we are closing this case and we are closing this case for the following
*  reasons.
*  This is the best we've been able to infer from justice's behavior, but close that they
*  did.
*  Okay, so the DOJ effectively shutters its case against Gaetz, but we don't really know
*  whether there was a crime or what ultimately was the rub there.
*  Was that the end of it?
*  It was not the end of it.
*  No, Congress picked up where the federal government left off.
*  The major political headline, new trouble for Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz tonight,
*  already under federal investigation.
*  Now the House Ethics Committee is also investigating its own set of allegations.
*  There is in Congress something called the House Ethics Committee, and it is a committee
*  composed of members of both parties.
*  It meets in secret to examine potential misconduct by sitting members of Congress.
*  It has its own fact gathering apparatus, and it's pretty deliberative.
*  It takes a while for them to come around on their stuff.
*  This is what happened then with the Gaetz matter.
*  The House Ethics Committee began to take a look at it, reliant to some degree on the
*  information that the Department of Justice had already gathered, but also not limited
*  to that.
*  The House Ethics Committee launching a bipartisan investigation, examining allegations of sexual
*  misconduct, illicit drug use.
*  Because there were allegations that Gaetz had been on the floor of the House showing
*  videos and still photographs on his iPhone of nude women.
*  And whether Gaetz shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor.
*  Allegations as well that he was having a relationship with a member of his staff, and as well allegations
*  that he was using federal campaign funds for his own personal use.
*  These were the kinds of things that were incoming for the Ethics Committee to consider.
*  So a wide ranging investigation with some pretty sordid allegations.
*  How does Gaetz respond to all of this?
*  Does he speak out?
*  Yes, yeah.
*  So they're saying there is a 17 year old girl who you had a relationship with.
*  Is that true?
*  And who is this girl?
*  What are they talking about?
*  The person doesn't exist.
*  I have not had a relationship with a 17 year old.
*  That is totally false.
*  As Gaetz always does, he spoke out vociferously indicating not only that these charges were
*  false, but that these charges were politically motivated.
*  Though this time not by Democrats so much as by Republican leaders with whom Gaetz had
*  gotten crosswise.
*  One of them in particular, Kevin McCarthy.
*  And why did Gaetz think that McCarthy was behind this investigation?
*  Those two had problems for a while.
*  I mean, McCarthy had donated to Gaetz's first couple of congressional campaigns, but they
*  never lied to each other.
*  McCarthy is sort of this glad hander, very much a member of the establishment.
*  So not Gaetz's kind of guy to begin with, and Gaetz for that matter as this flying ointment
*  who's always coming out against Republican leadership.
*  Not McCarthy's kind of guy.
*  Then when word surfaced that there was an investigation into Gaetz's behavior by the
*  federal government, far from Kevin McCarthy saying, I'm sure that these are unwarranted
*  investigations.
*  Those are serious implications.
*  If it comes out to be true, yes, we would remove them if that was the case.
*  But right now, as Matt Gaetz says, it is not true and we don't have any information.
*  So let's get all the information.
*  I don't really have any comment.
*  We'll just simply have to see what the federal government's got to do.
*  It was as lukewarm a kind of statement of support as could be imagined.
*  And Gaetz filed that one away.
*  And this all comes to a head in January of 2023, when Congress convenes to elect a speaker,
*  which is a pro forma thing that usually lasts a couple of hours.
*  So we are now in a situation where this Congress will make history.
*  We will have at least one more vote to see who the next speaker will be in the 118th
*  Congress.
*  But in this case became this protracted five day melodrama.
*  The House has six votes later and the Republican majority is still scrambling to pick someone,
*  anyone to serve as speaker of the House.
*  And why was this the case?
*  Because Matt Gaetz didn't like Kevin McCarthy.
*  After three days and hundreds of votes cast, the House has still not elected a speaker.
*  And was determined if not to completely stop McCarthy from becoming speaker, then to at
*  least drag it out.
*  Four days in, 12th round of voting and still no speaker of the House.
*  On Tuesday, Kevin McCarthy tried to get elected speaker, but he lost three times.
*  But then on Wednesday, lost three more times.
*  It was really, really melodramatic and it played out on national television where Gaetz
*  at one point was nearly assaulted.
*  Mediate something here.
*  It is getting really heated on the floor of the House.
*  McCarthy looks angry.
*  By a Republican member of Congress, Mike Rogers, who was a McCarthy ally.
*  Stay civil.
*  I hear someone saying stay civil.
*  Where Gaetz at various junctures.
*  I'm nominating Jim Jordan.
*  Nominated people, including Donald Trump, to be the speaker instead of McCarthy.
*  Mr. Speaker, my friend from Oklahoma says that my colleagues and I who don't support
*  Kevin McCarthy would plunge the House and the country into chaos.
*  Chaos is Speaker McCarthy.
*  And after successive balloting, McCarthy would go into a room with groups of Republicans
*  and they would manage to get him to agree on this or that thing.
*  For example, the allowance of a single member of Congress to call for a snap vote, known
*  as a motion to vacate.
*  As one Democrat put it, it's like they'll have a spokesperson, but not an actual speaker
*  in the House.
*  So he was coming in as like really the weakest speaker imaginable.
*  Meanwhile, there's Gaetz clearly enjoying this theater.
*  And even as McCarthy, by the end of it all, at the end of the five day stretch, emerges
*  victorious.
*  Probably the triumph is as much Matt Gaetz as anyone else's.
*  Yeah, what I really remember about that whole episode between Gaetz and McCarthy was just
*  the way that Gaetz went about it.
*  Like he withheld his vote for McCarthy over the speakership in this very ostentatious
*  way.
*  It's like he was, you know, humiliating him almost.
*  Like it was this incredible act of dominance, like this power move against him.
*  That's right.
*  It was a total Trump move.
*  And it was the kind of thing that Trump would remember as this is a guy who's got cojones.
*  This is a guy who will stand up to everyone.
*  So what became of the ethics investigation in the end?
*  Well it moved slowly, slowly because Gaetz continued effectively to delay it by responding
*  only at the last minute to inquiries and then doing so with the usual bombast being non-responsive.
*  And the ethics committee was having some difficulty getting traction, getting further information.
*  So it had produced a report roughly in late July, I believe is when it did, at least the
*  best that we can tell.
*  But there are rules in the House that govern when you can release a negative ethics report,
*  as this one was.
*  You can't do it close to an election.
*  So Gaetz had a primary in August.
*  They couldn't do it near then.
*  And then Gaetz was facing a general election in November.
*  So they couldn't do it then.
*  So they kept missing all these windows.
*  And now suddenly it is after the election.
*  Trump is elected president.
*  The Republicans regain control of the Senate, continue to have control over the House.
*  And meanwhile, there is this ethics committee report that's been sitting there that's understood
*  to be highly negative and therefore very damaging, involving criminal charges that could almost
*  certainly lead to Gaetz's expulsion from Congress.
*  Wow.
*  So there's that bomb just kind of sitting there.
*  What happens with it?
*  Well, what happens with it is that Donald Trump, before this can be released...
*  Today major surprises among Donald Trump's latest picks to fill his cabinet, including
*  Matt Gaetz, a fierce and loyal defender of Mr. Trump in Congress, now his choice to become
*  the next attorney general.
*  Besides on Wednesday that he wants Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general.
*  Trump today describing one of his strongest defenders as a quote, deeply gifted and tenacious
*  attorney who will end the partisan weaponization of our justice system.
*  And he makes this announcement and within a matter of hours, Gaetz resigns from the
*  House of Representatives.
*  He resigns.
*  Yeah, he resigns.
*  And in so doing, he's no longer a member of the House and an ethics committee investigation
*  into a House member is no longer pertinent.
*  You can't, in other words, release information about someone who's no longer a member of
*  Congress.
*  So it would seem then that the ethics report dies to death.
*  So the timing is quite interesting, right?
*  Gaetz is about to be the subject of this potentially hugely damaging report, could very well end
*  his career.
*  And then at this critical hour for Gaetz, Trump names him to the position that allows
*  him to resign from the House, effectively stopping the report and becoming potentially
*  the top law enforcement agent in the country, a role that beyond all of this potential legal
*  trouble he seems to be pretty unqualified for.
*  Yeah, it's I mean, it's this remarkable zero sum moment, you know, where he goes from a
*  guy of maximum exposure, potentially even criminal exposure, since after all, the feds
*  did not find him not guilty.
*  They didn't decide he was innocent.
*  They just decided not to pursue it anymore.
*  And so if all of these allegations surface, he's expelled from Congress, then he's himself
*  criminally vulnerable.
*  He goes from that to now being the nominee to be the chief law enforcement officer in
*  the land.
*  And so, yeah, it's this moment where a guy goes from really, really being in a deep,
*  dark place to a guy who may be sitting on top of the world referring to Matt Gaetz.
*  And why do you think it is that Trump named him?
*  Is it because, you know, having him on the hook, so to speak, means he would just do
*  his bidding?
*  I don't think it's that, Sabrina.
*  I don't think that he's doing it to do a solid for Gaetz or to own Gaetz.
*  I think that Gaetz's loyalty to Trump is not what's at issue here.
*  That's always been unquestioned.
*  It's instead an external signal that Trump is sending.
*  First of all, that he will select exactly who he wants to select.
*  He knows how audacious a choice this is, and he doesn't care.
*  And secondly, for this particular position, for the Department of Justice to have at the
*  top of it a Matt Gaetz sends a signal that, yes, I do mean good on what I said during
*  the campaign, that I, Donald Trump, will be your, his voters, retribution.
*  That I will use the Department of Justice in exactly the way that you would imagine
*  it would be used if Matt Gaetz were at the top of it.
*  It will be used as a weapon.
*  It will be used as the spear point to ward off any kind of investigations into the president
*  by the FBI or by the opposition.
*  And that it will be used as a means of attack against Trump's opponents, be they a sitting
*  senator like Adam Schiff, who'd been the head of the intelligence community and had brought
*  the first impeachment inquiry.
*  A former member of Congress, Liz Cheney, who became his most vocal Republican opponent,
*  and members of the press, or any number of individuals, Matt Gaetz will be at the very
*  top of a Department of Justice that will be the kind of justice that Donald Trump wants
*  justice to mean.
*  He will redefine the concept of justice through the personage of Gaetz as his attack dog.
*  But of course, there is a Senate confirmation process for his appointment.
*  So what are the senators saying about his nomination?
*  This one was not on my table card.
*  Elections have consequences.
*  He chose Matt Gaetz.
*  Matt will come before the committee and he will be asked hard questions and we'll see
*  how he does.
*  Well, there's been a sort of collective groan and or statements of shock.
*  Look, I barely know Gaetz.
*  All I know is he likes picking fights on social media.
*  He'll have to deal with that in committees.
*  But I don't know his background.
*  I'm going to look at it and give him a fair hearing.
*  I think there should not be any limitation on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation,
*  including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated.
*  None of them has come right out and said that they would oppose it.
*  But there's clearly some friction and clearly some kind of visceral opposition.
*  Now there's been some talk about the possibility of recess appointments, which would essentially
*  mean the Senate majority leader calling a 10-day recess and letting Trump push these
*  nominations through without a confirmation.
*  But right now, that seems pretty unlikely.
*  And I think that what's much more likely is that this will go to an actual vote.
*  And what if this ethics report does end up somehow getting out, like either leaked or
*  actually released?
*  I would imagine there would be a pretty big public outcry.
*  It's explosive.
*  Do we think Trump might blink and say, never mind?
*  It seems really unlikely that Trump is going to be in any way concerned by the release
*  of the report or for that matter, the contents of the report.
*  I think he's been fully briefed on what likely is in it.
*  And Trump knows who Gates is.
*  I don't think he will be in the least bit cowed by the prospect of unseemly contents.
*  I think he's expecting it.
*  I think that they'll essentially describe it as fake news by political opponents of
*  Gates's.
*  So we're talking on Sunday morning.
*  As of now, it seems likely that this is actually heading to a confirmation hearing in a Republican-controlled
*  Senate where, on the one hand, Gates has a lot of enemies.
*  But on the other, this group of senators is pretty afraid of crossing Trump.
*  So this sets up a pretty interesting showdown.
*  It certainly does.
*  Because it is an audacious move for Trump to pick someone who is not only unqualified
*  for the job, it would seem, who not only is so disliked by members of his own party, but
*  also is so encumbered.
*  And for Trump to basically be saying to the Senate, yeah, I know he's got all those problems.
*  I don't care.
*  The interim, anyway, is a very early test of just how willing the Republican Party is
*  to offer any kind of check on the president-elect.
*  It cannot be emphasized enough, Sabrina, that Republicans have been paying close attention
*  over the years to what's happened to those Republicans who have attempted to thwart Trump's
*  prominently Liz Cheney.
*  And none of them wants to suffer the Liz Cheney treatment.
*  So they recognize that standing up to Trump not only carries costs in terms of a basic
*  discomfort, but really can be a career-ending proposition.
*  And so we'll see whether Republicans are willing to say, look, we'll give you all of these
*  other nominations.
*  This is just a bridge too far.
*  Or if they in essence say, the bridge too far is also a bridge that we're going to be
*  willing to give you.
*  Robert, thank you.
*  It's my pleasure.
*  Thanks for having me, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Sunday, for the first time, President Biden gave Ukraine permission to use American long-range
*  missiles to hit targets inside Russia.
*  The weapons are likely to be employed against Russian and North Korean troops in defense
*  of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of Western Russia, an area that Ukraine invaded
*  in a surprise move in late October.
*  Biden's authorization was a major change in U.S. policy and comes just two months before
*  President-elect Donald Trump takes office.
*  Trump has vowed to limit support for Ukraine.
