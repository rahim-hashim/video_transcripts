# Why Britain Just Ended 14 Years of Conservative Rule
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs16FOwC8sc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kittroweth, and this is The Daily.
*  For more than a decade, Britain has been governed by conservatives who pushed the UK to the
*  right, embracing smaller government and Brexit.
*  Last week, that era officially came to an end.
*  My colleague Mark Landler explains why UK voters rejected the Conservative Party and
*  what a win by the British left means in a world where right-wing populism is on the
*  rise.
*  It's Wednesday, July 10th.
*  Mark, hi.
*  Welcome back to the show.
*  Hi there, Natalie.
*  I want to start this conversation by just asking you to help us break down what exactly
*  happened in the UK elections last week.
*  Well, the top line was the Conservative Party, which has been in government here for 14 years,
*  was swept out in a resounding landslide by the Labour Party.
*  So remember, the Conservatives, often known as the Tories, are the right-of-center party.
*  Labour is traditionally the left-of-center party, closely allied with the trade unions.
*  So what happened in this election is that Labour won more than 400 seats in the parliament
*  compared to only 121 seats for the Conservatives.
*  And so that puts the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, into 10 Downing Street as the Prime Minister.
*  It opens a new chapter in British politics after more than a decade of Conservative rule,
*  and it represents a resounding repudiation of the Conservatives by a very angry electorate.
*  This is just a massive shift.
*  What caused that turnaround after a decade-plus of Conservative rule?
*  What made the British voters reject the Tories in this election?
*  There were really three underlying issues that accumulated in a way that simply turned
*  voters against them.
*  So I'd start with the economy.
*  It's the bedrock issue.
*  The one that really underlies everything else.
*  And that story starts back in 2010, when the Conservatives first come back into government.
*  Our economy is stuck in a rut, and we need change to get it moving.
*  Let me tell you what I would do.
*  At that time, they position themselves as the responsible stewards coming in in the
*  aftermath of the global financial crisis to get Britain's house back in order to put
*  Britain back on a responsible course.
*  Britain's budget deficit is so huge, says David Cameron, that cuts of a massive £83
*  billion are needed.
*  It'll be the most dramatic cutback of government spending since the 1920s.
*  And so they embarked on this period that's known as fiscal austerity.
*  They basically cut back funding for everything.
*  They include 500,000 layoffs, cuts in welfare benefits and major cuts in the military.
*  In a sense, it balanced the books.
*  But it did so at a great cost to the economy and to public life in Britain.
*  The report by the International Monetary Fund did warn that austerity measures may be jeopardising
*  growth.
*  Britain ended up with a very slow growth economy, slow growth in wages that left people feeling
*  that they weren't growing any more prosperous, that they weren't growing wealthier, and sort
*  of built up this accumulated sense that things were on the wrong track.
*  And then there is this tumultuous event.
*  Brexit.
*  Brexit.
*  Brexit.
*  Brexit.
*  And that, of course, is Brexit.
*  I will go to Parliament and propose that the British people decide our future in Europe.
*  Recall in 2016, the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron called a referendum in which
*  British voters were asked.
*  You want to remain in the European Union or leave?
*  And there is this shock result.
*  The British people have spoken and the answer is we're out.
*  That Britain votes to leave the EU.
*  Is the UK economy standing at the cliff edge?
*  Or is there a soft landing the other side of Brexit?
*  And that adds yet another layer of drag on the economy.
*  The EU was and is Britain's largest trading partner.
*  Cutting those ties meant that suddenly trade became much more difficult, bureaucracy much
*  more cumbersome, and a general sense among businesses both within the UK and outside
*  the UK that maybe Britain wasn't as good a place to invest.
*  So there's almost a sense of this as a lost decade.
*  People feel that the British economy has been treading water and their own personal situations
*  have not gotten any better.
*  So at the end of this lost decade, do voters start to question whether the Tories are,
*  in fact, the responsible economic stewards they had said they were?
*  Well, you might think this would be the moment that they would turn on the Tories.
*  But in fact, the Tories managed to get themselves another term in the 2019 election.
*  And they stumbled on through a couple more prime ministers.
*  The economic crisis didn't really turn into a political disaster for the Tories until
*  Liz Truss.
*  Remind us who Liz Truss is.
*  So Liz Truss is the prime minister who came in right after Boris Johnson.
*  And what Liz Truss did is she came in and she basically tried an ideological experiment
*  on the British economy.
*  She tried to pass very radical, very sweeping and completely unfunded tax cuts.
*  And it had the effect of spooking the financial markets, sending the British pound into a
*  tailspin and basically wrecking the confidence of both the domestic audience as well as international
*  investors in the United Kingdom.
*  And in a matter of weeks, Liz Truss managed to undo whatever reputation the Conservative
*  Party had built over decades for responsibly managing the economy.
*  And she resigns on her 44th day in office.
*  Wow.
*  This incredibly brief tenure of Liz Truss was really the straw that broke the camel's
*  back here after more than a decade of economic trouble.
*  Yeah.
*  The voters were frustrated to be sure and discontent, but not until Truss came along
*  did the party really forfeit its reputation for knowing how to manage the economy.
*  After Truss, I think a majority of voters in this country simply decided we can't, if
*  you will, trust these people with our economy.
*  And what do things look like now?
*  Well, one of the things that's very striking about the UK today is you have this very dynamic,
*  vibrant capital city, London, which accounts for a disproportionate amount of economic
*  activity in the country.
*  And then you've got the hinterland, which in the UK can be a fairly depressing place.
*  The Midlands, the North, this is the old industrial belt.
*  It would be the equivalent of the Rust Belt in the American Midwest.
*  And these are places that have really suffered during this long period of austerity.
*  So if you go into some of these towns, you see boarded up storefronts, you see shuttered
*  factories, you see a lot of people on public assistance, a lot of people who are not physically
*  all that well.
*  And it is true, and it's a statistic that's often mentioned in this country, that if you
*  take London out of the equation on a GDP per capita basis, which is a very common way
*  of measuring wealth, the rest of England is roughly equivalent to the state of Mississippi,
*  which is, of course, one of the poorest states in America.
*  So that's one way of thinking about the Britain of 2024.
*  It's a major contrast between London and the rest of the country.
*  So it sounds like the economy is really struggling and people are starting to lay blame at the
*  feet of the Tories.
*  So that's one explanation for why the public turns on this party.
*  What else is at play?
*  Well, there's a second issue, and it's not unconnected from the first issue, and that
*  is the state of the National Health Service.
*  Across the UK, hospitals are at breaking point.
*  The beloved national public hospital network that tens of millions of Brits rely on every single day.
*  They are running out of beds and the patients keep coming.
*  This also has been a victim of years and years of austerity, of cost cutting, or of very
*  small budget increases.
*  The waiting room was rammed.
*  Trollies were just piling up in the hallway.
*  What you see are incredible lines in emergency rooms at big public hospitals.
*  Seven and a half million people in England now on a waiting list for hospital treatment.
*  If you make an appointment for elective surgery, you're often put on a waiting list for eight
*  months, ten months, twelve, or even fourteen months.
*  Even if you're a cancer patient, you might not get immediate treatment because the system
*  is simply so overwhelmed.
*  Staff shortages are now leading to fears for patient safety.
*  And after years and years of chronic underinvestment.
*  One junior doctor said she was quitting after just one year.
*  Paul Paye cited as the first reason for such a drastic move.
*  It simply doesn't have the physical resources, the human capital resources, the doctors,
*  the nurses, and so you just have this sense of a country that feels a bit hollowed out.
*  We haven't got enough doctors.
*  The governments aren't filling the NHS properly.
*  And this really has to stop.
*  This isn't, by the way, just true in the healthcare area, but it's most palpable and really most
*  visible to citizens in the NHS.
*  And part of the Tories' identity, right, is that they were the party of fiscal responsibility,
*  that they were the best stewards of the economy.
*  And it sounds like that really is no longer holding up in Britain and that they've actually
*  become seen as the ones who are causing these very real problems, everyday problems, for
*  the average voter.
*  Yeah, I think that's right.
*  I think that to the average voter, the mismanagement of the economy became linked to other things
*  that affected the quality of their everyday lives.
*  And then there's a final thing, and also very core to the identity of the modern Conservative
*  Party.
*  One of the major arguments that the pro-Brexit people made was that this will enable us to
*  cut down on mass, uncontrolled immigration.
*  And they failed utterly in that goal as well.
*  The number of net arrivals in the country has gone up from 300,000 to 780,000.
*  So rather than declining after Brexit, immigration soared.
*  How did that happen?
*  Why didn't immigration go down after Brexit, if that was the big promise?
*  Well this is one of the interesting paradoxes of the whole Brexit period.
*  This is the first time in nearly 40 years where the British government will be in control
*  and will determine its own immigration policy.
*  When Britain left the European Union, it did actually end freedom of travel for people
*  from the European Union.
*  We are bringing an end to a free movement of labour which of course is linked to our
*  membership of the European Union.
*  So what you saw much less of in London for example was waiters from Italy, Greece, Spain
*  in restaurants.
*  But what the government was doing, you know rather quietly, was changing the immigration
*  rules.
*  Some important news today on long-term migration into the UK.
*  In the year of June there's been a surge in long-term immigration.
*  So that rather than allowing relatively young unskilled workers from the EU, the country
*  began being more open to much higher skilled people from other parts of the world.
*  Now the jump has caused by a rise in non-EU migration with special factors at play.
*  Overseas students coming back to the UK as Covid restrictions have relaxed.
*  So while you see much fewer Polish plumbers for example, you see many more Indian, Sri
*  Indian, Pakistani doctors.
*  Special support to people from Ukraine and Hong Kong.
*  And of course you see many more Filipina nurses.
*  And of course the impact of the Afghan resettlement program.
*  Many more graduate students from Nigeria or other parts of Africa.
*  So immigration didn't decline, it's the nature of immigration changed.
*  Does that make people mad?
*  Because I think we're used to seeing in the US at least, that the frustration and resentment
*  towards immigrants is usually related to the people who are coming in and are in more desperate
*  situations.
*  Not folks getting angry about doctors or lawyers from abroad.
*  It's a very complicated issue and I'm glad you asked it this way because it is in fact
*  true that for many English people going to a hospital and being treated by an Indian
*  doctor does not arouse any resentment.
*  They're grateful that they have a doctor who's able to see them.
*  The problem arises more from immigration in the aggregate.
*  Net migration to this country has increased massively.
*  There's this sense that the borders have been thrown open.
*  How many more houses do we have to build?
*  That immigration is out of control.
*  Are they being schooled and educated and looked after by our social and health services?
*  That's my main concern, how are we going to be able to cope because we're not really coping
*  now are we?
*  So there is this kind of nagging sense, on the part of many people by the way, it's not
*  just people on the right, that immigration has gotten out of control.
*  That this government had promised to sort of bring it under control and instead the
*  opposite seems to be happening.
*  Basically it sounds like there's a lot of people who wanted Brexit specifically to reduce
*  migration.
*  These are folks who felt betrayed by the Tories because they got the opposite result.
*  And that's part of a bigger thread here, right?
*  This is a story about mismanagement of core issues for the British public.
*  The economy is a mess, immigration is rising, the healthcare system is rife with dysfunction.
*  So is it fair to see the results of the election as essentially a rejection of conservatism
*  in the UK and of the ideals that brought us Brexit, which was so core to much of this
*  story?
*  I think it's certainly fair to see this election as a rejection of a party that failed at its
*  most basic task, which was governing effectively and responsibly.
*  On the face of it, it looks like a triumph of the left.
*  But when you dig into it, when you see how the voters voted, which parties did well,
*  which did less well, you get a much more complicated picture about what it is that voters really
*  wanted.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Mark, I wonder if you can explain why what looked like this huge win for the Labour Party
*  is actually more complex.
*  I mean, on the face of it, it would seem to be this sweeping endorsement of the left.
*  Is that not what this is?
*  Well, you're right.
*  On the face of it, it looks like a huge embrace of left of centre politics.
*  And in fact, the Labour Party performed very well in this election.
*  But the key thing to understand is this is not the same Labour Party that ran in the
*  last election in 2019.
*  This Labour Party is far more centrist.
*  And that's the result of a very methodical, deliberate plan on the part of the party's
*  leader, Keir Starmer, who's now the prime minister, to pull the party away from some
*  of its more left dispositions in an attempt to make it more acceptable to a broader range
*  of voters.
*  How drastic of a turn to the centre are we talking about here, Mark?
*  It was a fairly radical move on the part of Starmer.
*  If you look at the old Labour Party, the party that ran in the 2019 election, this was a
*  party that talked about renationalising the entire British electricity grid.
*  This was a party whose leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was openly sceptical about the role of NATO.
*  And in each of these areas, Starmer moved very deliberately.
*  He pulled the national security policy much more to the centre, made the party feel much
*  more patriotic.
*  He promised not to raise taxes on working people.
*  He promised not to vastly expand spending until the country could afford it.
*  So across every one of these areas, it's more than just rebranding the party.
*  Starmer really repositioned it and turned it into a centre-left party rather than a
*  pure left-wing party.
*  Starmer, it sounds like, basically turns Labour into an alternative that wasn't all that different
*  from the Tories.
*  It just had much less baggage.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  It's an exaggeration to say that Labour is Tory 2.0.
*  There are policy differences, but the fundamental pitch here is, if you elect us, we will do
*  a better job than the Tories, but we won't give you a radically different government.
*  And now, is that what's happened?
*  I mean, is the Labour Party now the new standard bearer in British politics, this broadly acceptable
*  centrist party that most people can get behind?
*  Well, there's no question that in terms of seats, they are going to be the political
*  standard bearer.
*  But the interesting thing when you look to the actual raw vote is that the Labour Party
*  didn't roll up the kind of crushing landslide that you would expect, given how many seats
*  they gained.
*  Labour only got roughly a third of the raw vote, which is actually less than they got
*  in 2017 when they lost to the Conservatives.
*  And that speaks to the fragmentation of the electorate.
*  You had in this election not two parties, but four parties that performed well.
*  In addition to Labour and the Conservatives, you had the Liberal Democrats, another centrist
*  anti-Brexit party that did remarkably well.
*  And then perhaps most interestingly, you had this new anti-immigration insurgent populist
*  party, Reform UK, that came out of nowhere and became a major factor.
*  Okay, what's the backstory of that party?
*  So Reform grows out of the Brexit debate.
*  And basically, this is a party that's almost a single issue party.
*  It's an anti-immigration party.
*  They basically argue that Britain needs to get this flood of immigrants under control.
*  It's led by this very well-known, gleeful, insurgent politician named Nigel Farage.
*  He's been a fixture on the right in Britain for more than a decade.
*  He's one of the primary campaigners for Brexit.
*  And he fielded hundreds and hundreds of candidates in this election.
*  And what they wound up doing was siphoning off a lot of the Conservative vote.
*  And how typical is it to see this many parties do well in UK politics?
*  What do you make of the fact that these smaller, more obscure groups were able to do so well?
*  Well, it is quite unusual.
*  And it speaks to a couple of things.
*  One is that you have an electorate that, particularly among young voters, is much less loyal to
*  the major parties.
*  So in this election, Labour and the Conservatives together got only 57% of the vote.
*  That's the lowest combined percentage for the major parties at any time in the post-World
*  War II period.
*  So that's the overarching dynamic.
*  But there's something very interesting going on with votes on the right.
*  In this election, you had a number of Conservative voters vote for Reform UK as a way of registering
*  their unhappiness with the Conservative Party, particularly on the issue of immigration.
*  They knew that those votes would help ensure that a Labour Party got into government, but
*  they were less worried by that prospect.
*  In the old days, with that old, much more left Labour Party, Conservative voters would
*  have been much more reluctant not to stick with their own party for fear of allowing
*  the opposition to get into power.
*  This new Labour Party, this more centrist Labour Party, did not scare them the same
*  way.
*  And in a funny way, that empowered them and enabled them to cast that protest vote for
*  Reform UK.
*  And that's really what split the vote on the right and allowed Labour to do so well.
*  So you have these Conservative voters who are still out there who want to punish the
*  Tories and now they feel like they can because they're not as scared, right, about a Labour
*  victory because Labour is just more palatable at this point.
*  That's right.
*  Labour has not threatened to raise their taxes.
*  It hasn't threatened to blow out the budget.
*  It hasn't threatened to do all the things a Labour government might have done five years
*  ago.
*  And as a result, voting for Nigel Farage and his party seems like a less risky thing to
*  do.
*  So, Mark, this is a much more complicated picture for the Labour Party, which is now
*  running the government.
*  This is hardly a decisive win for them, an endorsement of their ideology.
*  How do you think they're seeing it?
*  Well, I think they recognize that because of all the issues we discussed, their relatively
*  low raw vote total, the fragmentation of the voters, the fact that other parties have done
*  so well that they need to produce results quickly, that they're dealing with an impatient
*  electorate, a volatile electorate, fickle voters who are not going to cut them a lot
*  of slack.
*  They know that in less than five years, the Conservatives managed to turn a landslide
*  victory into a landslide defeat.
*  And they don't want to suffer the same fate.
*  So Starmer, I think, is going to try that within a year or two, he can say to voters,
*  You elected me to be more competent.
*  You elected me to turn around this economy.
*  This is what I've done.
*  Judge me on that.
*  And then I think if he can pull that off, he has a very good shot of getting a second
*  term.
*  Starmer wants to move fast here.
*  But, I mean, it strikes me that all the issues we talked about, these challenges he's staring
*  down are pretty hard to turn around quickly.
*  I mean, fixing the economy in the midst of global economic uncertainty, fixing a starved
*  health care system, immigration.
*  Yeah, I mean, you raise exactly the right point.
*  Starmer is in this very difficult situation where he needs to show some quick wins.
*  But a lot of the remedies are long term.
*  And there's an added problem.
*  He has no money.
*  So he has to do all this with an empty larder, if you will.
*  And that's going to be perhaps the biggest challenge of all.
*  How do you show wins when you don't have many tools to work with?
*  Right. And waiting in the wings, you have these smaller groups, right, including this
*  far right anti-immigrant party that, you know, is looking to see what happens and prepared
*  to capitalize on any weakness, I'd assume.
*  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
*  Even though the Reform Party won only five seats in Parliament, one of those seats belongs
*  to Nigel Farage, and he is going to be taking shots at the Labour government, pointing out
*  every single shortcoming with an eye to building up his party over time so that if Labour
*  really fails in three, four or five years, reform might not just be an insurgent party,
*  it might actually be a party positioned to either play a kingmaker role or really be
*  a dominant presence in British politics.
*  Mark, that leads me to ask you how you're thinking about the stakes here and not just
*  for the UK, but for the world.
*  I mean, what would it mean for the Labour Party to fail?
*  I think failure would have a profound consequence for liberal democracies in the West.
*  I mean, remember, France is currently dealing with a surging hard right movement in its
*  parliamentary elections.
*  The Germans dealt with hard right advances in recent European elections.
*  And in a matter of months, voters in America may elect Donald Trump.
*  So I think that the failure of the Labour Party would reinforce a populist wave that
*  appears to be building in many of these countries.
*  And success?
*  If the Labour Party can show that a centrist government can function effectively in a world
*  that's buffeted by all of these populist, more extremist trends, you could foresee a
*  world in three years where Keir Starmer, a successful centre-left prime minister, almost
*  stands as a bulwark for the rules-based international order.
*  And this would be particularly true if Donald Trump were elected in the US in November.
*  You know, the interesting precedent for this is Angela Merkel, who was the Chancellor of
*  Germany when Trump was in his first term as president and was widely viewed as almost
*  the leader of the liberal democratic world.
*  That's a role I think that Keir Starmer could potentially inhabit, depending on how events
*  play out.
*  There's a lot of caveats here in both the US and in Britain.
*  But I do think that Starmer has this potential to play a very, very significant role at an
*  uncertain time in the West.
*  Mark, thank you so much.
*  Thanks, Natalie.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Are you confident that President Biden has what it takes to win in November and serve
*  the next four years?
*  As I've said before, I'm with Joe.
*  Top congressional Democrats are indicating they are unwilling, for now at least, to push
*  President Biden aside, despite deep concerns about his ability to win re-election.
*  Was there more people saying Biden should step down or more people saying he should step down?
*  We're riding with Biden.
*  House and Senate Democrats emerged from private meetings on Tuesday swearing allegiance to
*  Biden, but the party remains deeply fractured.
*  In the House, seven members have already called for Biden to withdraw, including most recently
*  Mikey Sherrill of New Jersey.
*  Clearly, this president is fit to serve.
*  He has been fighting for the American people.
*  I know more than 14 million Americans have already voted for him, including those in
*  my state of Nevada.
*  Biden has remained strong thanks to the backing of key constituencies, including the
*  Congressional Black Caucus, which has come out in strong support of the president's candidacy.
