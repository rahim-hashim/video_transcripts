# The Death of Tyre Nichols
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=4.28s)]
*  Today. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  What really happened to Tyree Nichols, who died after he was violently beaten by police [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=14.88s)]
*  in Memphis? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=21.78s)]
*  An encounter captured in a series of videos released over the weekend. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=23.52s)]
*  My colleague, Southern Bureau Chief Rick Rojas, is in Memphis, where he's been piecing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=29.72s)]
*  together the story. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=36.48s)]
*  It's Monday, January 30th. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=41.32s)]
*  Rick, tell us about Tyree Nichols, the man at the center of this story. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=53.36s)]
*  So Tyree Nichols was a 29 year old man who lived in Memphis. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=61.96s)]
*  He was black and his mother described him as living a kind of simple, pleasant life. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=66.34s)]
*  Every day, like clockwork, he would wake up at 830 and he would go to the same Starbucks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=73.68s)]
*  and get the same drink. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=79.2s)]
*  He had been working for about nine months at a FedEx facility in the city and he seemed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  to be doing well on all accounts. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=88.16s)]
*  He loved to skateboard and he was a regular at Shelby Farms, which is this really sprawling [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=90.16s)]
*  park just outside Memphis. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=97.22s)]
*  He'd go almost every day, either for skating or to photograph the sunset. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=98.92s)]
*  He was an amateur photographer and he had a four year old son and he just seemed like [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=105.82s)]
*  someone who was like a typical 29 year old who was finding his way and building a life [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=113.22s)]
*  for himself. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=120.69999999999999s)]
*  And so I think for his family, that's what has made this all the more staggering. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=122.46s)]
*  They didn't see him as someone who would have any kind of encounter with the police. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=128.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=132.94s)]
*  I want to talk about that encounter. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=133.94s)]
*  We of course now have a video of it, but for several weeks we didn't and there was a fair [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=136.26s)]
*  bit of mystery around what exactly had happened. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=141.82s)]
*  So I'm wondering, Rick, if you could take us back to what first happened to Tyreanicals [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=145.82s)]
*  and walk us through how this all unfolded as we experienced it in real time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=151.88s)]
*  Yeah, this case has been shrouded in a lot of mystery before the video came out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=159.62s)]
*  At the beginning, what we know came from a police statement. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=164.42s)]
*  So on January 7th, Tyreanicals gets pulled over by the police in the southeastern corner [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  of the city. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=178.42s)]
*  It was around 8.30 p.m. and it was on suspicion of reckless driving. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=179.42s)]
*  And at that point, there was some sort of physical confrontation between Tyreanicals [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=185.58s)]
*  and those officers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  He then took off on foot. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=197.74s)]
*  The officers caught up with him and then there was a second confrontation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=201.62s)]
*  And somewhere during the course of those confrontations, he sustained a level of injury [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=208.18s)]
*  that was so severe that he needed to be hospitalized. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=217.66s)]
*  He was unconscious for three days and then he died on January 10th. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=223.22s)]
*  So in the immediate aftermath, all we know is that a pretty routine sounding traffic [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=238.38s)]
*  stop has ended in Tyreanicals death. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  And so of course, the question becomes, did these officers use excessive force? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=249.1s)]
*  So what happens in the next few days? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=254.84s)]
*  So multiple investigations are launched. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=259.94s)]
*  First, there's an internal inquiry by the Memphis Police Department. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=262.46s)]
*  And then the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation was called in to look at the basics of the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=267.26s)]
*  case to try to understand whether or not the officers had used excessive force and whether [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=272.06s)]
*  that use of force reached a criminal level. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  And then after that, federal prosecutors also said that they would be launching a civil [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=283.38s)]
*  rights investigation into what happened as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=288.26s)]
*  So everyone in law enforcement is taking this pretty seriously. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=292.38000000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=296.26000000000005s)]
*  And in a way to acknowledge that, city officials announced pretty early on that they wanted [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=297.26000000000005s)]
*  to be transparent and they planned to release whatever video footage they collected as part [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=304.18s)]
*  of their investigation to show the public what happened during that traffic stop. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  And then on January 20th, 10 days after Tyreanicals died, the city announced that the internal [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=317.3s)]
*  investigation by the Memphis Police Department had been wrapped up and they fired five police [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=324.26s)]
*  officers who had been at the scene that night. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=330.98s)]
*  They said that they had used excessive force. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=335.58s)]
*  They said that they had failed in their duty to intervene and failed in their duty to render [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=338.78s)]
*  aid. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=344.38s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=345.5s)]
*  And in this moment, Rick, when these five officers are fired, what do we learn about them? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=346.5s)]
*  So we learn a few things. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=353.86s)]
*  We learn that they're all black. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=355.74s)]
*  We learn that they're all in their 20s to early 30s. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=357.86s)]
*  So they're all relatively new to the force, having spent only a few years in the department. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=361.78s)]
*  They all joined between 2017 and 2020. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  And then we also learn that they're part of a specialized group of officers called the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=371.98s)]
*  Scorpion Unit. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=377.62s)]
*  And it's a group that patrols high crime areas of the city where there's been persistent [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=379.42s)]
*  struggles with violence. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=386.42s)]
*  And it was created in 2021 at a time when the murder rate was climbing, when anxiety [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=388.98s)]
*  over public safety was escalating. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=395.78s)]
*  And this was kind of cast as like a way to directly combat that by putting these officers [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=399.14s)]
*  out into the streets in these neighborhoods. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  So at this point, what we know is that these five officers are part of an elite unit that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=408.94s)]
*  seems kind of specially empowered to crack down on crime in Memphis. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=413.5s)]
*  Very notably, what we know is that all five of them are black and are accused of ending [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=419.46s)]
*  the life of a black man. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=426.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=428.21999999999997s)]
*  And at this point, the family launched this effort to really push for, you know, as they [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  see it, getting justice for Tyree. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=435.02s)]
*  And the first part of that is just seeing this video, trying to understand how this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=438.14s)]
*  traffic stop went from what seemed like a routine traffic stop and became something [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=444.46s)]
*  so much worse. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=452.38s)]
*  And so finally, last Monday, Tyree Nichols' family and their lawyers, they had the chance [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=455.26s)]
*  to finally see the footage for themselves. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=462.06s)]
*  Thank you so much for allowing us to be in your cathedral to address this injustice. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=464.7s)]
*  And afterwards, they had a press conference, and that's where we were able to hear some [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=470.9s)]
*  of the first descriptions of what the cameras were able to capture. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=474.26s)]
*  What we can tell you about the video is it is appalling. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=478.82s)]
*  It is deplorable. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=483.46s)]
*  It is heinous. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=484.46s)]
*  And it's very troublesome on every level. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=487.46s)]
*  The family's attorney, Ben Crump, who is a very prominent civil rights lawyer who represented [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=491.78s)]
*  the family of George Floyd, just talked about how troubling the footage was. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=497.34s)]
*  You know, regrettably, it reminded us of Rodney King video. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=503.06s)]
*  Regrettably, and unlike Rodney King, Tyree didn't survive. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=509.3s)]
*  Let me say this about Tyree, about what we saw in that video. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=519.1s)]
*  And then one of the family's other lawyers described Tyree Nichols. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=523.9s)]
*  He was a human piñata for those police officers. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=528.26s)]
*  It was an unadulterated, unabashed, nonstop beating of this young boy for three minutes. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=535.74s)]
*  And throughout all of this, you could just hear his mother crying in the background. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=547.9399999999999s)]
*  My name is Robon Williams and I'm Tyree's mother. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=554.02s)]
*  My son, I know everybody say they mother say they had a good son. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=560.3s)]
*  Everybody's son is good. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=564.8199999999999s)]
*  But my son, he actually was a good boy. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  She could make it through the first minute of the video because of just how painful it was to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  witness that happening to her son. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=578.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't have any feelings right now. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=581.26s)]
*  I don't even know how to I don't know anything right now. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=584.26s)]
*  All I know is my son Tyree is not here with me anymore. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=587.86s)]
*  He will never walk through that door again. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=593.62s)]
*  All my son was trying to do was get home. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=597.26s)]
*  So at this point, Memphis is learning about this video through the filter of a horrified family. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=600.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=617.2199999999999s)]
*  And then last Thursday, just a few days after the family was able to see the video, local [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=618.2199999999999s)]
*  prosecutors announced that the five officers had been charged with second degree murder. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=629.3399999999999s)]
*  Among other felonies. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=630.3399999999999s)]
*  And with this announcement, we just hear this outpouring of condemnation. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=631.9799999999999s)]
*  While each of the five individuals played a different role in the incident in question. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=636.4599999999999s)]
*  From the district attorney. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=641.5799999999999s)]
*  They are all responsible in the death of Tyree Nichols. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=642.5799999999999s)]
*  From the Memphis police chief. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=646.8199999999999s)]
*  This incident was heinous, reckless and inhumane. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=649.2199999999999s)]
*  From the head of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=653.0999999999999s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=656.6600000000001s)]
*  What happened here does not at all reflect proper policing. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=658.58s)]
*  This was wrong. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=664.5s)]
*  This was criminal. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=666.32s)]
*  This is not just a professional failing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=667.82s)]
*  This is a failing of basic humanity toward another individual. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=670.48s)]
*  And we hear from them that this was a violation of human rights and it was a crime. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=674.6600000000001s)]
*  We all want the same thing. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  We want justice for Tyree Nichols. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=683.04s)]
*  And yet with all these descriptions, we still don't know exactly what happened. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=691.8s)]
*  We don't know why was Tyree Nichols stopped in the first place? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=698.28s)]
*  How did he react when the officers stopped him? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=703.68s)]
*  Why did he flee on foot? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=708.24s)]
*  What did the officers do to Tyree? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=711.28s)]
*  We hear that there's been excessive use of force, but what does that actually mean? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=714.3s)]
*  And then we don't know how long it takes for medical personnel to treat him. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=720.38s)]
*  And we don't know how long it takes before he is taken to a hospital. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=725.14s)]
*  There's just so many questions that are still unanswered at this point. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=730.54s)]
*  Right, because so far, what's on this video is only really being filtered through first [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=735.26s)]
*  the family, now these city officials, all of whom are saying that they're horrified, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  but the public has yet to see any of the video itself. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=746.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=751.0600000000001s)]
*  And so on the same day that the charges are announced against the officers, the city says [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=752.0600000000001s)]
*  that the video will finally be released to the public sometime on Friday evening. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=757.52s)]
*  And so, you know, not only are these officials coming out and saying that they're horrified [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=765.86s)]
*  by the content of the video, they also really express deep concern about the kind of reaction [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=771.9s)]
*  it will provoke in the city. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=779.9s)]
*  The police chief, various elected officials, activists, even, you know, Mr. Nichols' own [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=782.26s)]
*  mother comes out and just implores the community to not let the anger or outrage that they [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=788.5s)]
*  really worry about them having after seeing this, they don't want that to turn into something [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=796.98s)]
*  destructive. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=802.98s)]
*  So this sense of anticipation and really this sense of anxiety are really building in Memphis [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=805.56s)]
*  now. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=812.22s)]
*  After school activities have been closed across the city. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=813.58s)]
*  Public law enforcement from around the state has been summoned to Memphis to be on standby. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=817.18s)]
*  So they're prepared to see what happens when people in this city finally have the chance [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=822.62s)]
*  to see this for themselves. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=829.7399999999999s)]
*  And on Friday night, as promised, the video is released. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=834.66s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=839.82s)]
*  So Rick, walk us through what we see once this video footage is finally released on [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=851.82s)]
*  Friday night. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=857.98s)]
*  So it ends up actually being four separate videos that are all posted online and it adds [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=859.22s)]
*  up to roughly an hour of footage. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=865.1s)]
*  It's a combination of footage from body cameras as well as stationary footage from police [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=868.54s)]
*  cameras that are posted around the neighborhood. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=875.98s)]
*  And so there's just a feed from one of those cameras. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=879.14s)]
*  And it starts in the middle of Tyree Nichols being pulled over. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=883.02s)]
*  So we never actually see the beginning of the stop. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=888.0999999999999s)]
*  God, so while the police have been saying that this was a case of reckless driving, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=890.98s)]
*  we don't actually see that or hear the police telling Tyree Nichols that they're pulling [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=896.72s)]
*  him over for that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=903.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=904.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=905.08s)]
*  So the whole reason this all unfolded, like we still don't know the answer to that question. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=906.08s)]
*  And so the body camera is on and suddenly the audio kicks in. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=911.84s)]
*  And we just see his car in the middle of an intersection at a traffic light and we can [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=919.6800000000001s)]
*  see officers, they're running towards his car, their guns are drawn, they're cursing [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=925.0s)]
*  at them, they're telling him to get out and get on the ground. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=930.36s)]
*  And he does. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=934.2s)]
*  You guys are really doing a lot right now. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=935.2s)]
*  Bro, lay down. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=937.2s)]
*  I'm just trying to go home. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=938.2s)]
*  And at one point, he's just lying on the ground pleading, like, I'm just trying to go home. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=940.48s)]
*  An officer tries to pepper spray him. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=946.48s)]
*  And at that point, he runs. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=949.5400000000001s)]
*  The officer tried to tase him, but he gets away. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=954.1600000000001s)]
*  And so about eight minutes later, the officers catch up to him in a residential area and [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=960.5600000000001s)]
*  he's tackled to the ground. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=973.32s)]
*  The officers pepper spray him. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=977.6s)]
*  They hit and kick him. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=980.4s)]
*  You can see him being kicked in the head. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  Watch out! [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=985.0400000000001s)]
*  I'm going to baton the fuck out of you! [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=986.0400000000001s)]
*  He's a fucking ass! [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=987.0400000000001s)]
*  You can see him being hit with batons. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=988.9200000000001s)]
*  Part of the reason that we're able to see this is not just because it's the up close [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=992.16s)]
*  kind of shaky body camera footage. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=997.76s)]
*  We actually have this bird's eye view from the street camera that just is able to capture [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=999.6800000000001s)]
*  everything as it's happening from above. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1006.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1009.9200000000001s)]
*  And at one point, they stand him up and an officer punches him repeatedly. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1010.9200000000001s)]
*  The beating lasts about three minutes. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1018.0400000000001s)]
*  And throughout it, you can just hear his cries of anguish. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1021.72s)]
*  At one point, you can hear him crying out for his mom. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1024.48s)]
*  He says, Mom, Mom, Mom. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1028.32s)]
*  And her home is maybe 100 yards away. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1030.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1034.96s)]
*  It's very difficult footage to watch. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1036.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1040.16s)]
*  It's a lot to take in. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1042.48s)]
*  Eventually, you know, the officers prop him up against the police car. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1043.48s)]
*  He slumps over. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1049.92s)]
*  I ain't even, look, we got him out the car. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1050.92s)]
*  He's like, hey, bro, you good? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1053.92s)]
*  I'm going to swung. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1054.92s)]
*  Bow! [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1055.92s)]
*  Almost hit me. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1056.92s)]
*  He reached for Mark Gunn. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1057.92s)]
*  He slammed him to the side. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1058.92s)]
*  He literally had his hand on Mark Gunn. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1059.92s)]
*  Like, that motherfucker was on him. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1060.92s)]
*  And you can see the whole thing. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1061.92s)]
*  And you can hear officers saying that he reached for one of their guns or he tried to take [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1063.52s)]
*  a swing at them. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1072.92s)]
*  But those are things that we actually don't see in the video. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1074.64s)]
*  I mean, other than him running after the stop, like, we don't really see any resistance. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1078.76s)]
*  There's really no evidence that we can see from the videos of him fighting back. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1087.0s)]
*  That motherfucker high. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1092.32s)]
*  He high. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1093.8s)]
*  He high as a mug. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1094.8s)]
*  They also said that they thought that he was high, but there was no real evidence. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1096.84s)]
*  It seemed so far to back that up. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1102.84s)]
*  So the officers appear at a couple of different moments here to be trying to justify their [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1106.1599999999999s)]
*  actions, even though the footage doesn't really support the actions. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1114.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  And then a couple of minutes later, you have emergency responders arrive at the scene. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1120.88s)]
*  There are two medics from the fire department. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1126.5200000000002s)]
*  They look at Nichols, but you can see they're not administering any care. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1128.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1132.8000000000002s)]
*  I remember watching it and kind of counting the number of people on the scene. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1133.8000000000002s)]
*  It's upwards of 10, none of whom appear to be doing anything to attend to Tyree Nichols. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1138.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1145.48s)]
*  He's just sitting by that car for more than 24 minutes before an ambulance arrives. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1147.2s)]
*  And occasionally Nichols slumps over by the car and they prop him up. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1152.68s)]
*  So thinking back to those questions, Rick, that we all had before the footage was released, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1157.76s)]
*  it does seem like a lot of them were answered in these videos because we see these officers [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1163.52s)]
*  really aggressively approach Tyree Nichols' vehicle, pull him to the ground. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1169.96s)]
*  He runs, we don't know why, but he does not fight back at any point, as you said. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1176.12s)]
*  We hear the officers at one point expressing an intent to hurt him. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1182.7199999999998s)]
*  We then clearly see that they're using a tremendous amount of force against this person who's [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1188.52s)]
*  not fighting back. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1194.4399999999998s)]
*  And we later hear the officers offering a justification or a set of justifications for [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1196.12s)]
*  their actions after the fact in ways that don't really line up with what we see in the [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1200.8s)]
*  videos. And finally, we see the police and these medics showing very little regard for [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1205.32s)]
*  Tyree Nichols' injuries or his well-being, despite the fact that he's visibly and audibly [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  in pain. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1219.2s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1220.2s)]
*  And that's why so many of the people I've talked to said that they found the video as [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1222.9199999999998s)]
*  disturbing and as infuriating as the family made it out to be. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1227.76s)]
*  Not just the brutality on display and the beating, but also what they saw as the callousness [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1233.08s)]
*  in the waiting around that came after. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1239.36s)]
*  So I want to turn to how people in Memphis have reacted to this footage, given all the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1243.3999999999999s)]
*  anxiety that was expressed by both city officials and Tyree Nichols' family over what the reaction [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1250.12s)]
*  would look like. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  There was pain, there was anger. Many people in Memphis watched the footage, but there [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1259.72s)]
*  were also others that didn't, that couldn't. They felt that whatever they would learn wouldn't [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1265.48s)]
*  be outweighed by the trauma they'd inflict by seeing something like this. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1270.48s)]
*  And there were protests in Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1276.24s)]
*  in Memphis, too. You had dozens come out on Friday night. They blocked off an interstate, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1283.5600000000002s)]
*  and they closed off a bridge, but things wrapped up peacefully before too long. And [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1288.84s)]
*  it was sort of the same on Saturday, where there was a modest showing, but there were [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  people that came out and demanded justice. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1298.6s)]
*  Is there a sense that the way the city of Memphis has handled this case so far and what [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1302.56s)]
*  looks to be a real determination to get the wheels of justice in motion so quickly, that [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1309.36s)]
*  may help explain why the reaction has been what it's been, which is to say peaceful and, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1316.68s)]
*  to a degree, a little understated. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1323.88s)]
*  I think so. I mean, Ben Crump, the lawyer for the family, said at a press conference [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1326.88s)]
*  before the tape came out on Friday that this should be the blueprint, America, is what [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1332.1200000000001s)]
*  he said. He talked about how swiftly officials moved here to fire the officers, how swiftly [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1337.8000000000002s)]
*  they moved to bring criminal charges on in less than a month. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1343.6s)]
*  Right. I'm curious, as we think about how people are reacting to this all, how folks [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1349.28s)]
*  are thinking about what has been really a central element of what happened to Tyree [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1356.04s)]
*  Nichols and something that's different about this case from a lot of the cases of alleged [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1361.24s)]
*  police brutality that we have focused on in this country, which is that he is a black [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1366.84s)]
*  man who was allegedly killed by five black police officers. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1372.44s)]
*  And as painfully familiar as we have become with black men dying at the hands of the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1378.0s)]
*  police, typically in these cases that get a lot of attention, it's been at the hands [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1385.2800000000002s)]
*  of white police officers. So we're a little less prepared for all the officers to be [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1391.24s)]
*  black. So how are people thinking about that and how are they making sense of it? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1398.1599999999999s)]
*  It's very complicated. One of the prevailing sentiments that I hear in Memphis is just [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1404.8s)]
*  this sense of sadness over all of this. One of my colleagues spoke to a woman who just [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1412.9199999999998s)]
*  she saw the photos of the officers on TV and she was just disappointed. You know, how could [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1419.24s)]
*  you do this? She asked. Memphis, it's a majority black city and it has a majority black [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1424.1599999999999s)]
*  police force. And, you know, the idea has been that if you have a police force whose [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1430.28s)]
*  demographics match those of the city, that it can make a difference, that it could make [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1437.56s)]
*  policing more effective, that it could really reduce the tensions that endure between the [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1442.56s)]
*  community and law enforcement. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1448.4799999999998s)]
*  Right. And potentially prevent things like this from happening, what happened in this [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1450.76s)]
*  case. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1456.6s)]
*  Right. Right. And so this was an instance where that mode of thinking didn't really [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1457.44s)]
*  bear out. And so what I hear from many of the people that you talk to here is that, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1463.3999999999999s)]
*  yes, there is a lot of anger and frustration directed at these five officers, but they [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1468.2s)]
*  see this as an indictment of a system and of a culture that surrounds policing so that [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1477.8799999999999s)]
*  the race of the officers doesn't actually make that much of a difference, that the [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1484.56s)]
*  divisions between the police and the community just still remain the same. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1491.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. The question I think a lot of people are asking in the wake of what happened to [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1498.3999999999999s)]
*  Tyree Nichols is whether there's something about policing, something fundamental that [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1501.9599999999998s)]
*  occurs when officers put on that uniform, given the nature of modern policing, that [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1507.44s)]
*  somehow encourages brutality, especially toward black people, but not just toward them. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1513.56s)]
*  And regardless of the race of the officers. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1521.0s)]
*  Exactly. And that's really what has made this so much more complicated. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1525.16s)]
*  So Rick, what happens now in Memphis? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1531.28s)]
*  What do we expect the next few weeks to look like in this case? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1534.6s)]
*  The mayor, the police chief have all committed to really kind of digging in and examining [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1540.0s)]
*  how do you prevent something like this from happening and how do you build something [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1545.6s)]
*  better? And, you know, one of the first steps of that was on Saturday, the police chief [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1549.44s)]
*  said that she had disbanded the Scorpion unit, the specialized group of which these five [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1555.12s)]
*  officers had been a part of. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1559.72s)]
*  And so there's still the investigations about what actually happened at the scene. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1562.96s)]
*  You know, those two medics who responded to the call and were seen not doing very much [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1568.44s)]
*  in the video, they were relieved of duty by the fire department. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1572.6000000000001s)]
*  And there's an investigation about whether, you know, they should be fired or face other [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1576.28s)]
*  consequences. Tyree Nichols' family believes that they should be criminally charged. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1580.2s)]
*  Two sheriff's deputies have also been relieved of duty as the sheriff's department here [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1586.28s)]
*  tries to figure out what they were doing at the scene. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1591.04s)]
*  There is a separate federal civil rights investigation that's happening. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1594.68s)]
*  And then there's the case against the five officers who were charged with second degree [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1600.56s)]
*  murder. You know, the prosecution is moving forward with them and it could very well head [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1604.44s)]
*  to trial. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1609.84s)]
*  Rick, have the five officers or lawyers for them said anything in their defense? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1610.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, the main thing is they've just pleaded with the public to avoid a rush to [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1616.8s)]
*  judgment. And they've made the case that the video does not tell you everything and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1621.9599999999998s)]
*  that the public should not base their opinions entirely upon what they see in that [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1628.4399999999998s)]
*  video. You know, just as we don't know what initiated the stop, there may be other [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1634.28s)]
*  factors potentially is what these lawyers are saying that just aren't reflected in [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1640.8s)]
*  the footage that we saw. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1646.56s)]
*  Right. It strikes me that Memphis is about to go through what many cities in the U.S., [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1648.68s)]
*  like Minneapolis and Ferguson and Baltimore, have gone through after a case like [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1655.12s)]
*  this, which is first a trauma, right? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1661.44s)]
*  A kind of collective trauma around an alleged case of police brutality that ends in [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1664.52s)]
*  the death of a black man and then a trial that very painfully relives it all. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1670.6s)]
*  Right. It's going to be a long road. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1676.84s)]
*  So when I talk to people in the community, there is this sense of skepticism that still [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1679.1599999999999s)]
*  really lingers because, yes, there have been charges, there have been firings, there [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1684.04s)]
*  have been changes in police department policy. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1690.4399999999998s)]
*  As Crump was saying that there is this blueprint now. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1693.9199999999998s)]
*  There is a blueprint, but it's like the house isn't built. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1696.6799999999998s)]
*  That's the feeling. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1700.6s)]
*  It's that, you know, what happens with the trial? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1703.9599999999998s)]
*  What happens ultimately with the police department? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1706.8s)]
*  And what I hear, especially from people that are really invested in this case, they know [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1710.1599999999999s)]
*  that it's going to take vigilance because it really is a long road ahead to get to the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1716.3999999999999s)]
*  place where they want the city to be. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1722.08s)]
*  And that's with a better police department and with these officers being held [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1724.08s)]
*  accountable. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1730.48s)]
*  Well, Rick, thank you very much. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1740.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1743.4s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1755.04s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1760.48s)]
*  On Sunday, violence erupted in the Israeli occupied West Bank, where Israeli settlers [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1764.04s)]
*  carried out dozens of attacks against Palestinians and their property. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1770.44s)]
*  It was the latest in a series of deadly clashes that began last Thursday when the Israeli [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1776.0s)]
*  military staged a raid in which 10 people were killed. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1782.48s)]
*  Israel said that the raid was a counter-terrorism operation aimed at Islamic jihadists [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1786.68s)]
*  planning attacks against Israeli targets. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1792.2800000000002s)]
*  The next day, a Palestinian gunman killed seven people outside a synagogue in a Jewish [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1795.92s)]
*  settlement in East Jerusalem. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1802.64s)]
*  Overall, at least 20 people have died over the past four days. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftClo_zb6-U&t=1804.6000000000001s)]
