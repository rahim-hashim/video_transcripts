# The Man Trying to Save Phoenix From Historic Heat
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHpDMbpPals)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is a daily.
*  As a historic heat wave grips much of the world and the United States, no city has become
*  more emblematic of the crisis than Phoenix, Arizona.
*  Never in the city's history has it been this hot for this long.
*  Temperatures have exceeded 110 degrees Fahrenheit for the past three weeks.
*  It's like you open an oven door and it's what it feels like.
*  As long as I stay under this tree, I'm OK.
*  When the sun goes down, we're out walking and going to the park.
*  So I guess we have to be vampires in this kind of weather.
*  Today, a conversation with Phoenix's chief heat officer about how the city is adjusting
*  to the new reality of chronic extreme heat and whether we're adapting to it fast enough.
*  It's Thursday, July 20th.
*  Hey, Dave.
*  How are you doing?
*  Good. Good, good, good.
*  Thank you for making time for us. We really appreciate it.
*  Absolutely. And I know we've got a coordination meeting here at two, our time.
*  So we'll we'll get as far as we can for as much of that time as possible.
*  Gorgeous. OK, so Dave, can you just introduce yourself for our listeners?
*  Absolutely. My name is Dave Hondula.
*  I'm the director of heat response and mitigation for the city of Phoenix.
*  We're so proud in Phoenix to have the country's first publicly funded office in the city government
*  working on heat and everyday learning how we can do that work better.
*  The first in the nation. Wow.
*  It has been a good learning experience for us.
*  We're almost two years into the job here in Phoenix.
*  There was certainly a sense that more work needed to be done on heat.
*  Things are getting warmer.
*  It is a significant public health hazard. Right.
*  And heat is a hazard that has fallen into a governance gap.
*  OK, well, we'll turn to that governance gap in just a few moments.
*  But basically, you're the official heat authority in Phoenix.
*  And as it happens, we're talking to you after your city made history.
*  Nineteen consecutive days of temperatures above 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
*  At this very moment, I just checked it's 112 degrees Fahrenheit there.
*  I mean, Phoenix has always been hot in the summer, but this is a new kind of intensity.
*  So can you describe for us what this kind of heat feels like over,
*  especially this many consecutive days?
*  Because from a distance, especially from the northeast, it's a little bit alien to a lot of us.
*  Yeah, I think our experience right now is actually not so dissimilar
*  from what many of the cold weather states experience in the winter,
*  when the long cold spells, in some case with snow on the ground,
*  very much changes the cadence of daily life.
*  If it's snowy or icy, there's just a little bit of a careful way
*  we have to move about the city, not to slip, not to touch something that's too cold.
*  And I see the same thing in the heat world as well.
*  Being careful touching the steering wheel, seatbelt buckle.
*  As a new parent, we have a year and a half year old,
*  even something simple like when we can go for a walk to the stroller is really quite limited.
*  Now it's early morning hours or late evening hours.
*  I think one would be very hard pressed to find anyone at a public
*  playground during times of high sun angle.
*  There are certainly plenty of public spaces that are a little quieter
*  in the summer, the playground, the sports field.
*  It feels like it's a little harder to see people moving about the city at this time of the year.
*  So how is it affecting your work and what it means to be the chief heat officer
*  in this moment of history making heat in Phoenix?
*  Walk us through that.
*  Yeah, it is an interesting time to have this job in this place of the United States.
*  Right now, in general, our office really has two related missions.
*  One is what we call heat response.
*  And I've probably made more phone calls and sent more text messages over the past
*  two weeks than I have in any other two week period of my life.
*  Trying to help coordinate our regional response with many partners over the past weekend.
*  For example, we anticipated a surge of people needing relief from the heat at some of our
*  downtown cooling centers and respite centers.
*  And we were able to get some volunteers and other supplies deployed to those locations.
*  But we also focus on what we call heat mitigation, long term strategies for cooling the
*  city and making it more comfortable.
*  And it is important for that work to continue as well, even as we have these emergency heat
*  conditions manifesting, get them ready for tree planting initiatives in the fall.
*  All of that needs to continue as well as responding to this heat event.
*  Did you ever think, Dave, that you would be doing this job under these conditions, that you
*  would be contending with heat this intense?
*  You would say yes.
*  Now, three years ago, I never envisioned that nobody envisioned that anybody would be doing
*  this job. We should say that first and foremost, the idea of a heat
*  didn't exist. A heat role in local government didn't even exist.
*  But I think as somebody who has studied climate data quite intimately in the past, I think the
*  general idea that here in Phoenix and these hot cities all across the Sunbelt, that it can be very
*  hot for a long period of time is certainly why we plan for heat as a chronic hazard, not an
*  episodic one.
*  Well, tell me, Dave, how you got here to this position, how you became this person in this
*  moment, the heat guy in the hottest city.
*  Were you always drawn to heat?
*  I wouldn't say I was always drawn to heat, but certainly always drawn to the weather.
*  Growing up in New Jersey, I experienced all four seasons and I have vivid memories of taking my
*  parents VHS camcorder out on the streets when we'd have snow or flooding and try to
*  document it and tell the story to no audience at the time.
*  What was happening with the weather?
*  Remain interested in weather going into high school.
*  I actually had the dubious or distinguished role of being the weather reporter on our
*  homeroom TV channels, again, telling the story to the public.
*  What's happening with the weather now?
*  A little bit of a larger audience.
*  But never, never really understood that heat was a topic of interest until I got connected with my
*  advisor in grad school who was in this discipline called biometeorology and some other was
*  relating temperature and health outcomes.
*  And it didn't take very long to become hooked.
*  Heat, arguably the leading weather related killer in the United States, certainly responsible
*  for more health impacts than most other hazards combined.
*  And I think the lack of attention to heat compared to some of the other hazards was also a
*  little bit of a draw.
*  Well, explain that. What do you mean, the lack of attention?
*  Yeah, well, I think if we were to take a random sample of media coverage of weather hazards in the
*  United States over the past 10 years, I suspect the big headlines, the big stories would
*  largely be dominated by hazards that break stuff.
*  Right. Hurricanes, tornadoes.
*  Right. Winter storms, tornadoes, which have very real societal costs.
*  I don't mean to downplay the importance of those hazards.
*  They produce real tangible infrastructure costs as well.
*  We can see the building being ripped off of its foundation.
*  Right. We can see the community that's been devastated by the tornado.
*  Phoenix is going to look about the same after this heat event as it did beforehand.
*  Hmm. So the lack of attention to this intrigues you, gets you motivated to study heat.
*  Obviously, you follow that passion into this role, the first in the city's history.
*  I'm curious when you stepped into that just a couple of years ago, what your vision was for
*  helping Phoenix deal with and adapt to heat, what specific objectives you were trying to
*  achieve, knowing that it was always going to be hot there.
*  Absolutely. I think my personal motivation to even consider applying for the job in the
*  first place came from my own experience.
*  And I think what many of my colleagues are feeling as well, we're really studying a lot
*  about this heat challenge and we're not sure that all of that interesting, maybe useful
*  information is going anywhere.
*  And at some point, I guess we can write an infinite number of papers, but if they're not
*  actually serving some type of societal benefit, that could feel a little bit of an empty
*  exercise over time.
*  And so I envisioned that part of my role and stepping into this role, can we take the
*  incredible body of research that's been generated and help local government make better
*  decisions to serve the public and address the many, many different challenges that heat
*  brings to cities all across the country?
*  How do we protect people on the top?
*  And over the long term, can we realize the vision of a more comfortable city for everyone
*  in the future?
*  We'll be right back.
*  Just I just wanted to note the time, but I think we probably just need like 10 more
*  minutes if that's OK.
*  OK, let me I'm just going to open up this other call and mute them, but just let me
*  know I am here.
*  This is our regional cooling center work group.
*  And of course, yeah, big day for that group today.
*  I imagine. What specifically would a more comfortable city in this heat look like?
*  And how did you start to envision what that would be?
*  How it would manifest itself?
*  What the particulars of it would become?
*  If you were to go to a community meeting and talk about heat right now and what
*  neighborhoods are looking for, we'd probably hear some concerns about high
*  electricity bills first, but quickly thereafter would be the need for more shade.
*  A more comfortable feeling for the future is one that has more shade.
*  And there's a big ask of our office and requests from the community to really
*  accelerate tree planting here in the city.
*  When we think about climate change and how hot places are, we're often talking
*  about even just when we started our conversation today, we're talking about the
*  air temperature that's measured at Sky Harbor Airport.
*  But I think what we're really trying to shift our thinking to is what is the actual
*  radiant environment?
*  What is the thermal comfort of the spaces that people are moving through
*  throughout the city?
*  It could be 120 degrees at Sky Harbor Airport, but the experience of a person in
*  the shade moving throughout the city can be much more comfortable than 120 degrees
*  in the sun.
*  And when you first stepped into this role to present day, what challenges have you
*  encountered in trying to create, for example, more shade?
*  It probably means more trees, right?
*  More gardens, more structures that create shade.
*  But that's not something from my experience in covering government that anyone
*  official can do. So I'm curious what kind of obstacles you bump into.
*  So we know that the city historically, at least over the past decade, has struggled
*  to make progress, arguably in part because there hasn't been a team that has been
*  responsible for coordination across all city departments and community efforts.
*  But it's really been in the site identification that we spent a lot of time and had
*  a lot of learning. There might be a thousand people across the country, maybe
*  10,000, who have generated some type of map in their academic journey to inform
*  cities where to plant trees.
*  Right.
*  And for coming to city government, I thought we were doing a good job working with
*  the city to understand how to make those tools useful.
*  But we partnered with the street transportation department on one of their tree
*  planting programs.
*  And the street transportation department here maintains certain areas along the
*  streets in the city.
*  Right.
*  Listeners can imagine a map of 10,000 little irregularly shaped polygons scattered
*  throughout the city where the city can plant trees.
*  So in this particular case, those are the spaces, the only places where the street
*  transportation department can plant trees.
*  We've been prioritizing the wrong types of areas.
*  So a little bit of back to the drawing board, if the question is what are the most
*  important landscape maintenance areas to plant in now?
*  Right. So you come at it from the perspective of we should put this huge number of
*  trees in this place and create shade.
*  Meanwhile, you've got a city workforce that has rules that say they can only plant
*  trees in these small little parcels of land, maybe near roads.
*  So your goals aren't necessarily aligned, which means you have to go back and figure
*  out how to get the thing you want.
*  All of which is to say that being the chief heat officer at a place like Phoenix means
*  coming up with great ideas and realizing that they're very hard to pull off within
*  the bureaucracy and rules and realities of a city government.
*  And I would argue it means being a little persistent and being willing to try to
*  ruffle some feathers a little bit.
*  But through those experiences, we generated a little saying among our team, the heat
*  office wasn't created to maintain the status quo.
*  So all those rules, processes, institutional memories that you referenced in some
*  cases, I see it as our job to try to shake those up a little bit, because clearly
*  there's an ask from our elected leadership here and ask in the community to do
*  something different than we have past to present.
*  Hmm.
*  I'm really curious what a truly successful program is going to look like, because in
*  a lot of people's estimation, a place like Phoenix was never really meant to be lived
*  in at heat levels like this.
*  I'm sure you've heard this argument.
*  Maybe you reject it.
*  I mean, you've become the heat authority in a place.
*  So obviously you are invested in it being livable.
*  But there's an argument to be made that a place like Phoenix isn't really supposed to
*  be where huge housing subdevelopments are created and where people try to ride out
*  112 degree days, day after day after day after day.
*  And I wonder how you think about being the person who's trying to help people adapt
*  to that. Some people might view that as you asking them to get used to it and kind of
*  think of it as normal when it's in some ways not a normal thing to try to live in an
*  environment like that.
*  Well, if we were to go back millions of years, it would have seemed absurd to have
*  people live anywhere on the planet.
*  Right.
*  You know, hostile conditions with large predators roaming around that would eat us.
*  It's also a question of a sort of time frame starting point for this conversation.
*  And of course, you know, some of the earliest societies really developed and boomed in
*  some of the hottest places on the planet.
*  Now, were they exactly as hot with the same infrastructure that the city of Phoenix has
*  today? Certainly not.
*  But, you know, I do think we've seen over time tremendous success and resilience of
*  humans in living in a really wide range of environmental conditions.
*  Do you feel the burden of making a place like Phoenix more livable?
*  I mean, it occurs to me if you don't succeed in this job in a few years, Phoenix is a
*  place that's going to be a truly harder place to live for all kinds of people, including
*  a young child that you just brought into the world.
*  Yeah, I do interpret it as part of our responsibility, both individually and our team
*  in the heat office and city government to improve livability in the city.
*  And I think that's everything from which splash pads are open when to how many streets
*  have adequate shade to how long the cooling centers are open.
*  So, yeah, I absolutely interpret that as as part of our responsibility.
*  We've been making the argument that those questions should be somebody's responsibility
*  in city government.
*  And in a case of be careful what you wish for, here I am holding a piece of that.
*  You know, in many ways, you are both at the forefront of this, all this thinking and this
*  planning and at the forefront of this extreme heat.
*  And that's since you're a little bit of a pioneer of response and adaptation in this
*  new role. And I'm curious if you think.
*  Overall, all of us are improving fast enough to meet that new reality.
*  I think we've seen a good signal from the federal government of late that we haven't
*  been moving fast enough and that we can move faster.
*  Just this past week, we saw new funding opportunities from NOAA, the parent agency of
*  the Weather Service, to support communities in their heat work.
*  We have a National Hurricane Center.
*  We have a National Severe Storms Lab.
*  There's no such thing as the National Heat Center right now.
*  And if heat is one of our most consequential natural hazards from a public health
*  perspective, some type of coordinated and centered federal entity might make sense.
*  And I think this funding opportunity from NOAA is a good signal in that direction.
*  We've also seen proposed legislation that would potentially open channels for FEMA to
*  assist communities in preparing for and responding to heat events, similarly to how they
*  do for other hazards.
*  But I think it's very fair to say, as we look across the local, state and federal
*  government landscape in the U.S., that heat planning, heat investment are not where they
*  could be and not where they should be based on the health data we're seeing.
*  So a gap persists.
*  I'm just curious how it makes you feel that there's still a gap all these years.
*  It's the same question. I don't know.
*  I don't know if I've been too much contemplating how I feel about that other than being
*  encouraged that the trajectory is positive.
*  I guess I hold a sense of optimism that we are seeing steps and in some cases, not
*  non-trivial steps in the right direction.
*  The question, of course, that will literally be a matter of life or death for some
*  Americans is does that acceleration happen quickly enough?
*  So a final question for you, Dave.
*  What is the forecast in Phoenix for the next few days and for the next week?
*  Is it going to be another set of consecutive days over 110?
*  If anybody likes looking at a consecutive string of triple digit numbers, please tune
*  to the Phoenix weather forecast.
*  Unfortunately, it appears that the exclamation point on this current hot stretch is
*  yet to come. I think we've hit 118 so far in this stretch, but 119 is in the
*  forecast.
*  Wow.
*  So as we look into the forecast period, we don't see the end of the string or strong
*  suggestions of it anytime soon.
*  So you're going to be taking your baby outside in a stroller exceedingly early in
*  the morning for the next few days.
*  Or for exceedingly short periods of time.
*  Well, Dave, thank you for your time.
*  We really appreciate it.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  And hope everybody is able to stay cool and stay safe.
*  Thanks so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to nerdy.
*  Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and distinct honor to present to you
*  His Excellency, Isaac Herzog, President of the State of Israel.
*  On Wednesday, the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog, addressed a joint meeting of
*  the U.S. Congress at a fraught moment in the relationship between the two countries.
*  And a day after 10 Democratic House members voted against a resolution declaring
*  support for Israel.
*  Mr. Speaker, I'm not oblivious to criticism among friends, including some expressed by
*  respected members of this House.
*  I respect criticism, especially from friends.
*  Herzog acknowledged growing American criticism of Israel's current right-wing
*  government, especially over its plan to reduce the power of the judiciary, a plan
*  that has touched off massive protests in Israel and raised questions about the
*  future of Israeli democracy.
*  As President of Israel, I'm here to tell the American people and each of you that I
*  have great confidence in Israeli democracy.
*  Although we are working through sour issues just like you, I know our democracy is
*  strong and resilient.
*  Israel has democracy in its DNA.
*  In an interview with the Times published on Wednesday, President Biden urged Israel
*  to stop trying to ram through its overhaul of the judiciary, suggesting that it could
*  put the country's democracy and its relationship with the U.S.
*  at risk.
*  Today's episode was produced by Lindsay Garrison, Diana Nguyen and Nina Feldman.
*  It was edited by Patricia Willens, fact-checked by Susan Lee, contains original
*  music by Dan Pell, Marion Lozano, Rowan Yamisto and Chelsea Daniel, and was
*  engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Boborow.
*  See you tomorrow.
