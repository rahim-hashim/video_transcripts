# Democracy in Trumpâ€™s America
**New York Times - The Daily:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg)
*  So for voters who think democracy isn't working for them, Trump is going to fix it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=0.0s)]
*  Right. This was the original appeal in 2016. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=4.24s)]
*  He may be a bull in a China shop, but like you don't like the way the China shop looks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=6.16s)]
*  Right. You may have these grievances that were aired on stage. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  He is going to fix that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Now, the professionalized side of his campaign says the it is inflation and immigration [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=16.16s)]
*  and concerns that are like voiced by broad swaths of Americans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=20.44s)]
*  But people get to hear what they want. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=23.92s)]
*  And I think the idea is that many people feel alienated by our institutions. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=25.36s)]
*  And he is saying he will fix it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  He will break it and he will do it in whatever way he thinks is best. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=33.28s)]
*  And you should trust him as this one singular figure as he's presented himself for eight years. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=36.84s)]
*  I mean, one thing I think is important to note here is that he is putting forward with this a very [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  different form of American government and is not necessarily as democratic as we think of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  American government to be. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=53.08s)]
*  He is in a situation where his opponent, the Harris campaign, is calling him a fascist. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  He has his ex-officials, as we talked about last week, coming out and saying he would use his [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  power to prosecute his political enemies and instead an opponent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=64.6s)]
*  And he names them. I mean, there's been a series of interviews he's done on Fox News where the Fox [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=68.4s)]
*  News hosts say, this is metaphorical, right? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=72.88s)]
*  You don't actually mean these actual people who oppose you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=75.36s)]
*  And Trump says, no, no, I do. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=78.72s)]
*  I mean, Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=80.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  So he is saying to America, I will prosecute my political opponents. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  I will fire Jack Smith. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=87.92s)]
*  I will change the Justice Department. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=89.56s)]
*  Maybe deport him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=91.48s)]
*  Maybe deport him. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=92.04s)]
*  I will limit the independence of the Justice Department. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=93.04s)]
*  He is putting forward very clearly for all of us to see a very different form of American [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  government and I think a less democratic one. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1ckiD2IMg&t=100.96000000000001s)]
