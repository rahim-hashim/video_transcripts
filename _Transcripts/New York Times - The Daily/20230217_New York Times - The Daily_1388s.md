Video Description: The typical sales price of an existing family home in the United States in December: 372,700. The number of layoffs in the tech sector since the beginning of the year: 76,000. The number by which consumer spending fell in December: 0.2 percent. The increase in the cost of the same kind of carton of eggs bought by an editor on “The Daily” a year apart: 251 percent.


What do these numbers tell us about the state of the country’s economy?

# The State of the U.S. Economy in 4 Numbers
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=4.16s)]
*  Today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=10.96s)]
*  The state of the U.S. economy so far in 2023, as explained through four different numbers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=13.6s)]
*  My colleague, Ben Castleman, on what those numbers can tell us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=22.02s)]
*  It's Wednesday, February 1st. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=33.66s)]
*  Ben, welcome back to the show. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=40.82s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  We come to you, as we always do today, with a curiosity about the U.S. economy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=48.1s)]
*  And the meta story of our economy right now, as you and our colleagues have told us over [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=54.38s)]
*  and over and over, is that inflation is high. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=58.260000000000005s)]
*  The government wants to lower it and has taken aggressive action to accomplish that, which [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=62.02s)]
*  has all kinds of ripple effects across the economy and could eventually tip us into a [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=66.38s)]
*  recession. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=71.14s)]
*  And since the new year began, a lot of economic numbers have been flying around. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=72.14s)]
*  Some of which feel contradictory or at the very least confusing when it comes to the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=77.78s)]
*  question of inflation and recession. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  And so we wanted to talk those numbers through with you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  That's our mission today. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=91.42s)]
*  I will deliver perfect clarity and total foresight. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=92.54s)]
*  As I always do. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=98.42s)]
*  As only you can. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=99.42s)]
*  We're going to see about that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=100.42s)]
*  I should say I have come prepared. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=102.14s)]
*  I have assembled these numbers. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=104.1s)]
*  I'm bringing you numbers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=107.7s)]
*  This is going to have a kind of quiz show quality. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=108.89999999999999s)]
*  I am the host. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=110.74s)]
*  And the first number that I want to throw at you is about the housing market, which [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=112.02s)]
*  is of course a pillar of our economy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=116.58s)]
*  And that number, Ben, is 372,700, which of course you know this, is the typical sales [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  price of an existing single family home in the U.S. in December. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=128.38s)]
*  And in reading about that number, I found that it's up a lot compared with the past [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=135.18s)]
*  few years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=138.5s)]
*  So the reason I bring you this number is that it seems to reflect a pretty healthy housing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=139.5s)]
*  market. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  Is that the case? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  Yes and no. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=148.22s)]
*  Isn't that always the way I begin these answers? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=149.22s)]
*  Infuriating. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=153.22s)]
*  So let's take a little bit of a step back on what's been going on in the housing market. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  In the pandemic, Americans rushed out and bought homes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=160.5s)]
*  Early on, they were looking for more space as we were all working from home. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=167.1s)]
*  Interest rates, as you may recall, were super low. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=171.5s)]
*  And home prices soared. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=174.94s)]
*  I mean, just through the roof. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=176.29999999999998s)]
*  But that 372,000 number you cited to folks who are in New York or in San Francisco or [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  LA may not sound that high. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=184.1s)]
*  Before the pandemic, home prices had never been above $300,000 on a median level. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=185.96s)]
*  So they went way, way up. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  And of course, then something changed dramatically. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=194.72s)]
*  The Fed started raising interest rates. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=197.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=199.56s)]
*  Which of course means it's more expensive to borrow money and more expensive to buy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=200.56s)]
*  a home. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=203.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=204.28s)]
*  Classically, the housing market is the place where Fed policy has an impact. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=205.28s)]
*  It's the place where you borrow the most money as a consumer. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=211.6s)]
*  Builders borrow money to build. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=215.46s)]
*  Everything about the housing market is driven by interest rates. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  And so interest rates went up and the housing market ground to a halt. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=220.3s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=225.06s)]
*  But look at that nice number. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=227.58s)]
*  372,700. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=229.3s)]
*  That does not sound like a housing market grounding to a halt. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=230.3s)]
*  This is the crazy thing about the housing market right now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=234.3s)]
*  Everything has ground to a halt except prices. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  Builders stopped building homes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=240.56s)]
*  Builders stopped buying homes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=243.98s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=245.62s)]
*  If you in January of 2021, when interest rates were 3%, thought you could afford a $300,000 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=246.62s)]
*  home, when interest rates suddenly go up to 6%, even 7%, you can't afford a $300,000 home [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=254.14s)]
*  anymore. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=262.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=263.82s)]
*  The monthly payments are going to be too high for you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=264.82s)]
*  Now, what normally you would expect to happen, right, is that prices would fall. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=267.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=271.7s)]
*  The thing, the sellers of those homes are all sitting there with their 3% mortgages [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=273.02s)]
*  also. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  And they're like, you know what? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  Never mind giving up our nice cheap mortgage and moving to somewhere else where we're going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=280.7s)]
*  to have to borrow money at 6% so they don't sell. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=284.9s)]
*  So if you own an existing home with a low mortgage, your incentive to move and thereby [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=289.41999999999996s)]
*  create a potentially more affordable home for somebody else is virtually nil so you [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=295.94s)]
*  don't. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=301.5s)]
*  So prices don't go down. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=302.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=304.22s)]
*  So instead what happens? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=305.22s)]
*  Transactions go down. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=306.9s)]
*  Nobody buys, nobody sells, nobody builds. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=309.06s)]
*  The total number of single family home sales is down by more than a third over the past [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=312.66s)]
*  year. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=319.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=320.26s)]
*  So prices haven't moved much, but every other kind of activity has really fallen off a cliff. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=321.26s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=326.78s)]
*  OK, so is that a precursor to prices falling? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=327.85999999999996s)]
*  This kind of stubborn cycle that you're describing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=333.82s)]
*  People want prices to go down. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=337.17999999999995s)]
*  Sellers aren't willing to make them go down. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=339.02s)]
*  How long can that really last? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=341.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=342.9s)]
*  So is it a precursor? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=343.9s)]
*  Yes, almost certainly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=344.9s)]
*  Most forecasters expect home prices to start to fall and they have started to fall. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=346.78s)]
*  But it's going to take time and it's probably not, according again to most forecasters, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=352.73999999999995s)]
*  going to be a huge decline. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=357.26s)]
*  Which is good news, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=360.58s)]
*  If you're a homeowner, you don't want to see the value of your home collapse, but it also [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=362.26s)]
*  shows how slow this process is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=366.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  Which is another way of saying that everything the government has undertaken since the economy [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=371.82s)]
*  got overheated and we as a country decided we needed to do something about it, bring [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=377.18s)]
*  down prices. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=381.4s)]
*  It takes a while to do and that might not be the worst thing, but depending on where [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=383.24s)]
*  you are on the economy, it can be very, very frustrating. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  And if you're trying to buy a house right now, it's exceedingly frustrating. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's very frustrating for would-be home buyers. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  And we've got an entire millennial generation that has been waiting for a moment to break [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=396.72s)]
*  into the housing market, to finally buy, to finally start generating wealth in the housing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  market. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=406.68s)]
*  And, you know, I think many of them were sitting here saying, hey, maybe if prices come down, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=407.68s)]
*  I can finally buy in and, right, it's not happening. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=410.68s)]
*  But it's also very troubling for the Federal Reserve, for policymakers who are thinking [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  about the larger economy, because the concern there is if the economy doesn't slow in the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=419.08s)]
*  way that they expect, do they have to get even more aggressive? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=425.68s)]
*  Do they have to do even more to slow it down? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=430.04s)]
*  And if that happens, do they run the risk of causing a recession, which is going to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=433.6s)]
*  painful for a much larger number of people? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=438.6s)]
*  Indeed, which I think brings us quite naturally to the job market. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=441.36s)]
*  Our colleague, Gina Smilich, told us back in December about a pretty big wave of layoffs [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=447.12s)]
*  that started at the end of the year in the tech sector. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=453.56s)]
*  But it has only intensified since January 1st. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=457.46s)]
*  There have actually been 76,000 layoffs in that sector alone since the start of the year, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=462.08s)]
*  which is about 2,500 tech workers a day. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  And those layoffs have actually expanded now beyond tech into media, retail, and financial [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=473.56s)]
*  companies as well. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=479.44s)]
*  I think it's safe to say that that feels very ominous. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=480.44s)]
*  Is that how it looks to you? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=484.44s)]
*  Yeah, no question, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=486.24s)]
*  If you're reading the headlines right now and you're seeing these news of some of our [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=488.14s)]
*  biggest, strongest companies laying off, in some cases, tens of thousands of workers, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=491.9s)]
*  that's going to make a lot of people nervous. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  And as you said, this is not only in tech, but some perspective is really important here. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=500.18s)]
*  We still are seeing, in the aggregate, layoffs at among their lowest levels on record. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=505.5s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=513.9s)]
*  We'll get some new data this week and we'll see exactly what it shows. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=515.02s)]
*  But so far at least, it's really been isolated to a few sectors, a few mostly better-paying [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=518.6999999999999s)]
*  white-collar sectors, frankly. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=526.06s)]
*  And elsewhere in the labor market, things still look really strong. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=529.54s)]
*  Can you give us some data points on that? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=534.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so the unemployment rate is at 3.5%. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=536.3s)]
*  That's a 50-year low. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=540.14s)]
*  There are 10.5 million job openings in our most recent data. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=544.02s)]
*  That's down a little bit from the peak earlier last year, but it's still enormously high. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=550.66s)]
*  We're still seeing a couple hundred thousand jobs added on net every month. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=557.26s)]
*  So all of our sort of big-picture signals are that the job market still remains really, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=564.22s)]
*  really strong, that not many people are losing jobs. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=570.58s)]
*  If they are losing jobs, in most cases, they're able to go and get a new one relatively quickly. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=573.5s)]
*  I certainly don't want to understate the harm that it's doing to people who lose their jobs [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=579.26s)]
*  or the fears that they're facing, but we are not yet seeing any clear signs of mass layoffs [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=584.46s)]
*  or a huge sort of reversal of fortunes in the job market. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=591.98s)]
*  And why aren't we seeing those signs? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=596.1s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=601.1800000000001s)]
*  Why are things so healthy in the job market? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  It's a great question, and honestly, it's been a surprise to a lot of people that the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=603.1800000000001s)]
*  job market has stayed as strong as it has. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=607.58s)]
*  Companies have been trying like crazy to hire for the last couple of years and had a really [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=611.74s)]
*  hard time doing it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=616.86s)]
*  We've all heard about the labor shortage and the great resignation and all of this. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=618.34s)]
*  And so companies that have sort of finally managed to bring people back are not going [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=623.38s)]
*  to be eager just to turn around and fire them all, especially if they think that this [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=628.06s)]
*  might just be a short downturn. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot that's encouraging companies to keep hiring or at least to hold on to the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=635.18s)]
*  workers that they've already got. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=641.6199999999999s)]
*  Now, normally, a healthy job market is an unquestionable good for the economy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=642.6199999999999s)]
*  But as you and many others have told us, a healthy job market gets complicated when you're [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=648.5799999999999s)]
*  trying to control inflation. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=654.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=655.9799999999999s)]
*  Look, I think there's no question that low unemployment is a good thing. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=658.3s)]
*  And the whole goal here is to find a way to bring down inflation without causing a whole [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=663.06s)]
*  bunch of people to lose their jobs. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=668.5s)]
*  That's the goal right now. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=670.42s)]
*  But there is a sense that in order to do that, you need the job market to cool off in other [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=672.3399999999999s)]
*  ways. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=677.8199999999999s)]
*  Because when workers are able to just jump between jobs and play employers off each other, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=678.8199999999999s)]
*  they can demand more pay, more pay tends to lead to higher prices. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=683.78s)]
*  And so we are expecting to see and really in some ways hoping to see a bit of a cool [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=687.9s)]
*  down in the job market over time. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=693.14s)]
*  Got it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=695.06s)]
*  So as with the housing market, we're looking at a situation where the government just might [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=696.06s)]
*  need to do more to cool things down, to slow the economy. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=701.9399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=708.9399999999999s)]
*  The concern here is that if you hit the brake too hard, that the economy could slow more [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=710.1s)]
*  than you want. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=714.5400000000001s)]
*  So let's look at that tech layoff situation that you talked about before. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=715.5400000000001s)]
*  We saw a couple of companies laying off workers and then all of a sudden the whole sector, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=719.1s)]
*  it seemed like every company was laying off 6% of its workforce, 7% of its workforce. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=723.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=727.46s)]
*  It was almost like the layoffs from one company encouraged them at another. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=728.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=731.34s)]
*  And look, I think that there are some reasons why tech is a little bit of a universe unto [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=732.46s)]
*  itself. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=736.62s)]
*  But it is a reminder that kind of once the dam breaks, this can happen really fast. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=737.66s)]
*  And so we can't assume that just because the layoffs haven't started yet in a big way, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=744.3399999999999s)]
*  that they couldn't happen pretty quick once we sort of reach some tipping point. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=749.2199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=754.06s)]
*  And that suddenly looks like a layoff contagion. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=755.1s)]
*  And that starts to look a lot like a recession. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=758.86s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=767.66s)]
*  Ben we just talked about how the job market is in a healthy place, perhaps healthier than [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=778.54s)]
*  the government might want because it helps keep prices high. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=783.1s)]
*  So that's where I want to turn now. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=787.4599999999999s)]
*  Consumer spending. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=789.3399999999999s)]
*  The Times reported, and Ben you were a byline on the story, that consumer spending fell [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=790.66s)]
*  by 0.2% in December. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=797.26s)]
*  And that would seem like a good thing when it comes to inflation, but it's such a small [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=801.46s)]
*  decline, two tenths of a percentage that I don't know what to make of it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=805.74s)]
*  So what did you make of it? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=810.1s)]
*  I think what I make of it is that we're starting to see the first early signs that consumers [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=812.6600000000001s)]
*  might be pulling back. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=819.22s)]
*  If we sort of zoom out a little bit here, consumer spending has been on a tear practically [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=822.18s)]
*  since the pandemic began. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=828.9s)]
*  First people rushed out and bought stuff. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=833.02s)]
*  They bought pelotons, they bought cars, they bought like everything that they could find [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=835.5s)]
*  because they couldn't go on vacation. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=839.02s)]
*  And then the economy reopened and people went on vacation and they went out to restaurant [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=841.66s)]
*  meals right and they spent on services and they actually kept spending on stuff as well [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=846.9799999999999s)]
*  because it turned out a lot of people had saved a lot of money in COVID. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=852.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=857.86s)]
*  And so that has been a big driver of inflation. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=858.86s)]
*  And that was the story for most of last year. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=863.42s)]
*  In the last couple months of the year, we started to see some signs that that was shifting. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=866.18s)]
*  We started to see that those savings that people had built up were starting to dwindle. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=871.9s)]
*  We started to see that people were turning to credit cards because they were running [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=877.34s)]
*  out of cash. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=881.66s)]
*  And we started to see that actual spending was falling. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=883.5s)]
*  It fell a little bit in November, it fell a little bit in December. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=888.54s)]
*  Now I don't want to overstate this. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=894.6999999999999s)]
*  These were small declines. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=897.14s)]
*  They were just a couple of months. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=898.66s)]
*  Who knows what's going to happen in January and February and for the rest of this year. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=900.4599999999999s)]
*  But these were some of the early signs that consumers after dealing with high prices, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=904.26s)]
*  after hearing about recession, about hearing all those tech layoffs we were talking about [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=908.6999999999999s)]
*  before that they might be starting to say, you know what, I better pull back my spending [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=911.98s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=917.02s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=918.02s)]
*  It occurs to me that a consumer spending drop of point two percentage points might be a [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=919.02s)]
*  kind of ideal version of consumer spending slowing. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=926.06s)]
*  And I'm curious if you see it that way, because it's not so precipitous that it leads to entire [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=929.86s)]
*  industries undertaking big layoffs. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=936.14s)]
*  It sounds a little bit like the housing market. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=939.46s)]
*  You don't want the bottom to fall out all at once. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=941.1s)]
*  You want things to slow in a pretty gradual and gentle way. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=943.0600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=947.26s)]
*  But I'll push back on one thing, which is that any outright decline in spending, if [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=948.26s)]
*  it continues for any length of time, is almost certainly going to signal a recession. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=954.1s)]
*  Consumer spending is 70% of the U.S. economy. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=961.22s)]
*  If it starts to fall, even a small amount, but consistently over time, then retailers [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=963.72s)]
*  are going to have to start laying off workers, right? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=970.58s)]
*  Restaurants are going to have to start laying off workers. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=973.64s)]
*  They're literally selling less each month than the month before. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=975.08s)]
*  And that's when we get into a recession. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=979.0s)]
*  I think what we'd ideally like to see is slow growth. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=980.32s)]
*  That would sort of support that gradual cooling in the economy. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=985.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=988.9200000000001s)]
*  And help us avoid the dreaded R-word, recession. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  The dreaded R-word. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=993.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=994.16s)]
*  Ben, I want to end with a number that gets kicked around a lot. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=995.16s)]
*  And it's pretty much a national obsession. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1002.36s)]
*  And it happens to be a measure of inflation, which is the other big scary word in this [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1005.0s)]
*  conversation. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1013.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's the price of eggs. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1014.3199999999999s)]
*  And your friend, our editor, Lisa Chow, for some reason keeps her receipts forever. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1017.56s)]
*  And discovered that she had just paid $6.99 for a carton of 18 eggs at a local suburban [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1024.28s)]
*  grocery store. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1032.72s)]
*  A year ago, she found in rustling through those old receipts, back in January of 2022, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1033.72s)]
*  she paid $1.99 for that same carton of 18 eggs. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1039.6399999999999s)]
*  And that is a 251% price increase for the exact same thing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1044.92s)]
*  So how can that be? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1051.54s)]
*  And what does that tell us about inflation? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1053.8400000000001s)]
*  So first of all, Lisa needs to shop around for eggs a little bit more. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1057.5600000000002s)]
*  Because they're up a lot, but they're not up quite that much. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1060.3200000000002s)]
*  But no, look, eggs are up something like 60% over the past year. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1064.1200000000001s)]
*  So the price of eggs has absolutely gone crazy. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1067.1200000000001s)]
*  This is a huge deal for a lot of people. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1071.24s)]
*  On eggs specifically, there was an avian flu outbreak, which killed off a lot of chickens [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1074.52s)]
*  and led to, of course, then a shortage of eggs. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1079.6s)]
*  There have been accusations also of collusion, which I have not had a chance to dig into [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1082.44s)]
*  deeply, but may also be contributing to higher prices. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1088.08s)]
*  Right, egg fixing. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1092.2s)]
*  Egg fixing. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1093.6s)]
*  But I think there's a larger point here, which is that inflation has been cooling. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1094.6s)]
*  Summer prices overall actually fell slightly in December. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1100.56s)]
*  And over the past year, prices are up 6.5%, which is a lot, but is not nearly as high [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1106.2s)]
*  as the 8% and even 9% inflation that we were seeing in the middle of last year. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1114.08s)]
*  And while I don't think we're anywhere close to the Fed declaring victory on this, that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1119.9199999999998s)]
*  has been encouraging to see those price increases coming down from where they were in the middle [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1125.88s)]
*  of last year. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1131.5600000000002s)]
*  So I just want to pull back about as far as we possibly can in an episode about four different [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1132.5600000000002s)]
*  numbers because in each of them, it does seem like the overall direction of things is pretty [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1138.16s)]
*  good when we think about the kind of twin threats of inflation and recession. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1149.2800000000002s)]
*  Does that feel correct? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1155.44s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1157.0800000000002s)]
*  You started out this conversation talking about how we wanted to bring inflation down [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1158.4s)]
*  without causing a recession. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1164.44s)]
*  And inflation has come down and we have not yet had a recession, right? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1167.0800000000002s)]
*  Unemployment is still low. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1173.16s)]
*  And so nothing that has happened so far is inconsistent with that happy outcome. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1175.48s)]
*  It doesn't guarantee that we'll get there by any means and the job is not done. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1183.12s)]
*  But we have not yet veered off that course and that's good news. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1188.32s)]
*  Ben, I think it's possible we're going to end an episode about the economy in a kind [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1195.32s)]
*  of happy place, which is rare. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1203.9199999999998s)]
*  It is rare and I make no promises that the ending to our next episode together will be [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1207.32s)]
*  equally happy. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1214.16s)]
*  But I think that's right. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1216.32s)]
*  I think that right now, the things that have been happening are broadly speaking the things [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1217.32s)]
*  that we want to see. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1222.68s)]
*  And there are a lot of threats on the horizon, lots of things that could go wrong. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1224.36s)]
*  But they haven't gone wrong yet. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1229.3s)]
*  Maybe we should take that moment for the moment of optimism that it is. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  All right. Well, Ben, thank you very much. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1238.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1241.92s)]
*  On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates yet again in its latest [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1247.92s)]
*  effort to hold down inflation. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1255.52s)]
*  It would mark the eighth increase over the past year. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1258.64s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1268.8400000000001s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1274.8400000000001s)]
*  On Tuesday, Republican Congressman George Santos of New York, who has admitted to fabricating [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1278.24s)]
*  much of his biography and resume, told fellow House Republicans that he would temporarily [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1284.24s)]
*  step down from two congressional committees. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1290.34s)]
*  It was the first major concession from Santos since his lies were revealed and came just [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1294.44s)]
*  hours after he met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1301.36s)]
*  Did McCarthy tell you to step away from the committees? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1305.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, nobody tells me to do anything. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1308.24s)]
*  I made a decision on my own that I thought that's appropriate. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1310.24s)]
*  In an exchange with reporters outside the Capitol, Santos denied that the decision was [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1313.04s)]
*  made under pressure from Republican leaders. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1318.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, a poll of Santos's constituents has found that the vast majority of them want [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1322.04s)]
*  him to resign. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1329.04s)]
*  In the poll conducted by Newsday and Siena College and released on Tuesday, 78 percent [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1331.04s)]
*  of voters in Santos's district said he should leave Congress. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1337.76s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Astha Chaturvedi and Mary Wilson. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1343.04s)]
*  It was edited by Lisa Chow and John Ketchum, contains original music by Dan Powell, Marian [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1351.04s)]
*  Lozano and Alicia Baetube, and was engineered by Chris Wood. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFUDhafp8i0&t=1358.54s)]
