# 'The Interview': Serena Williams’s Next Challenge? The Rest of Her Life.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBtOHnHNM0E)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview.
*  I'm David Marchese.
*  A lot of people wind their way into middle age, having achieved some measure of career
*  success, only to ask themselves, well, now what?
*  And apparently this happens even if you're Serena Williams.
*  Serena, who's now 42 years old, retired from competitive tennis a little under two
*  years ago.
*  She'd won 23 grand slams, more than any woman in the open era, and just one shy of the all
*  time record.
*  Her level of fame and achievement, both on and off the court, broke boundaries for black
*  women and women athletes in general.
*  She is, by just about any account, the best ever at what she did.
*  Since she retired, Williams has directed that drive at some new projects.
*  She's got a venture capital fund and just launched a makeup line.
*  And she and her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, have two small girls.
*  So it's not exactly like she's been idle.
*  But the tennis court still calls.
*  She's gone back to it, in a way, with a new eight part documentary called In the Arena,
*  Serena Williams, which will stream on ESPN Plus next month.
*  And she told me that revisiting her career through the series has been the first chance
*  she's had to sit back and take in everything she accomplished.
*  Here's my conversation with Serena Williams.
*  So you've been retired from tennis for, it's not even two full years.
*  And one thing that I was thinking about in watching the documentary was really the kind
*  of amazing competitive spirit that you had.
*  And I'm curious about where that competitive spirit goes or how it changes once you're
*  no longer playing sports.
*  You know, you're doing the different projects.
*  You've got the venture capital fund, the makeup line.
*  I think you've written a children's book.
*  Did you feel like you, like, does it go away the next day?
*  Or did you feel like you had to find a new outlet for it?
*  For me, it was a necessary thing.
*  Like, I needed to not be done and sit down and wake up and be like, oh my God, what just
*  happened?
*  For me, it was like, thank goodness that I did something that maybe anyone would say
*  was too fast and not maybe.
*  It was definitely too fast to just throw myself full heart, full body into everything.
*  But that's kind of what I needed to do to survive, so to say, after I've been playing
*  tennis for all my life.
*  I think it would have been really hard.
*  So I just kind of did all that.
*  And when you say something you sort of needed to survive, you mean because you were sort
*  of worried or anxious about the prospect of not having new challenges once tennis was
*  done?
*  It wasn't about not having new challenges.
*  I think it was more around the fact of like, listen, you've been doing this since you've
*  been born.
*  Do you even know how to do anything else?
*  My whole mission in life was playing tennis, waking up every day.
*  What are you doing today?
*  Practice.
*  What are you going to do?
*  Train.
*  And then if you get injured, then you're like, what are you doing today?
*  Rehab.
*  So I can't get back to practice.
*  And that had been my life for over 40 years.
*  And so it was like, you don't go from literally a 40-year career to just going, okay, what
*  do you do today?
*  Nothing?
*  You know, I don't know.
*  So I kind of needed to just, I think all this was subconscious too.
*  I obviously wasn't doing this on purpose, but I think I subconsciously just kind of
*  overlapped.
*  So when my career did end, like literally the next day I had a huge team meeting for
*  Serena Ventures.
*  We were talking about companies.
*  taken over and it was just like all hands, all me on deck.
*  And I was on every single meeting.
*  I was in every founder meeting.
*  I was in everything.
*  And again, I think it was too much, but I think that was my way of coping because I
*  couldn't go from having purpose for all my life to having no purpose.
*  Does the having purpose aspect of things also include like the scheduling and how you're
*  spending your time?
*  Did you want to maintain kind of a strict or rigorous schedule for yourself?
*  You know what?
*  No, I didn't know that that's what I was doing for the record.
*  I didn't realize that.
*  But now I'm like wanting to figure out a way to take a break, which I probably should have
*  done earlier, but I don't know if I would have mentally survived that because of my
*  personality.
*  I probably would have been back on the tennis court playing tennis.
*  But yeah, now I'm just like, I haven't stopped in my whole life.
*  I've been going nonstop for my entire life.
*  So I kind of need a breather.
*  I really desperately need a breather.
*  So I'm trying to navigate all that now.
*  Your kids are still pretty young, right?
*  I have two girls.
*  One is eight months and one is six years old.
*  And is there a particular understanding that you want your daughters to have about what
*  you accomplished in tennis?
*  It's tricky, right?
*  Because it's like I want them to understand, but at the same time, that'll come with time.
*  So I'm not really too...
*  You know, Olympia told me the other day, like, you're famous.
*  And I'm like, not really.
*  I'm just your mom.
*  So I don't know.
*  I just feel like when the time comes and honestly, when it's settled in for me too, I know that
*  sounds really crazy, but when it's all settled in for me, I'll definitely have that conversation
*  with them and I'll let them know, like, you know, potentially the important, you know,
*  I don't want to be too presumptuous, but the impact I had, I should say, the impact that
*  I have had on sport and beyond.
*  You know, your dad famously saw something in you and in Venus and then worked so hard
*  to help you guys achieve that.
*  And he saw something in you and your sister when you guys were real little.
*  And I wonder, do you feel like you see something in your daughters in the way that your dad
*  saw something in you?
*  I don't know.
*  That's a really good question.
*  I feel like, I don't know, I always look at my dad and I think, how were you able to do
*  that?
*  Because I'm like, oh, they're so cute.
*  I just want them to relax and I don't want to over push them.
*  But I would be devastated if I wasn't pushed because we wouldn't be having this interview
*  and there would never have been a Serena Williams.
*  So I feel so fortunate that I had an opportunity to have that extra, you know what I mean?
*  But for whatever reason, I'm having a hard time connecting to like that extra push.
*  And that's something that I've been trying to figure out myself is like, how to get that
*  extra motivation to my daughters because it's definitely worth it.
*  I can confirm from experience.
*  Worked out pretty well for you.
*  It worked out well.
*  But what do I see?
*  I don't know.
*  I think my oldest, I mean, the eight month old is so tiny, but I think Olympia is such
*  a bright light.
*  And she's so athletic to a point where it's just not even humanly possible.
*  And my, even Venus, she was like, that kid has more talent than you and I combined.
*  And she's not lying.
*  So it's, I can see how my dad may have seen some potential in us.
*  Yeah.
*  So for me, I'm just like trying to figure out a way how to like harness all that and
*  just do that.
*  I'm like, I already told my dad, like, maybe you have to coach her because I'm too nice.
*  Yeah.
*  You're too soft.
*  I'm too soft.
*  Yeah.
*  There you go.
*  You know, I can imagine it's sort of an interesting thing that a lot of parents have to think
*  about.
*  It's like you do the hard work and push yourself on some level, maybe so that your kids don't
*  have to do the hard work, but then you also want them to achieve.
*  You don't want them to not reach their potential.
*  And like I said, I know from experience, it was definitely worth it.
*  I can confirm that.
*  So for me, it's like trying to get into a place where I do feel comfortable saying like,
*  okay, girls, we're going to do this every day.
*  But it also takes a lot of commitment from the parent.
*  And that's why I said now I have so much respect for my mom and my dad because I was like,
*  Okay, Olympia, we're going to play tennis every Wednesday.
*  And then I'm now I'm like,
*  And do you ever talk with Venus about why she still plays?
*  Like, do you understand why she's still out there?
*  Venus loves tennis.
*  And I think the question will be best answered from her.
*  I do not want to speak for her.
*  But I do know that that's something that I mean, we both love tennis.
*  Honestly, I feel like I would still be playing if I didn't have to stop and have a family.
*  Can I ask you a slightly tennis nerdy question?
*  For sure.
*  In the documentary, I think it's you're talking and I think it's you know, you're reminiscing
*  about after winning your first slam.
*  And you say that after that, you really had a bullseye on your back that the other players
*  on tour were really like, we got to beat the Williams sisters.
*  What did you think that was about back then?
*  And is your perspective on it now different?
*  I definitely had a red X on me.
*  And it was hard.
*  It was, you know, people assume that you're not friendly.
*  And that's usually not the case.
*  You're just there to win.
*  And you know, people don't really want to talk to winners in a single sport to be you
*  know, it's like the birds of a feather flock together and there's only one winner.
*  And so who are you going to flock with?
*  If I were playing soccer, it would be a completely different situation because you have a team
*  of players.
*  I had my mom and my dad and you know, we kept ourselves really close because we had to.
*  But yeah, I do feel like it shook the world.
*  I mean, come on, like a black girl wins a grand slam at 17 years old and she's from
*  Compton.
*  If you're not going to take notice, the world took notice of it.
*  So obviously they took notice.
*  And so it had been a dominated sport by Caucasians.
*  So it was like, whoa, we're having a change in our sport.
*  We don't like that.
*  This isn't normal.
*  Let's not let her win.
*  And so that's quite frankly what it was.
*  And do you find any of the same racial dynamics in play?
*  No, I didn't say race.
*  I didn't say that it was racial.
*  I just said that to be clear, I said that it was a change.
*  And just like anything, like you're going to notice if it was an Asian person winning
*  everything when there was only white people winning before, right?
*  So I happened to be black and it happened to be me and I happened to win a grand slam
*  and I happened to be young.
*  And it was like, whoa, this hasn't happened since the 50s.
*  So obviously it's going to take note.
*  And obviously it was like, well, we're not used to this.
*  So we want to make sure that we make our comeback too.
*  This is a semi random question.
*  Did you see challengers?
*  That is so random.
*  And yes, I did see challenges.
*  Thoughts?
*  I thought it was good.
*  I wanted there to be more of an ending.
*  I was like, I told Zendaya, I was like, listen, is there more?
*  Like I want more.
*  Did they win?
*  I mean, I don't want to give away the inner ending, but yeah, I thought it was quite interesting.
*  Did you see it?
*  I did see it.
*  Yeah.
*  I liked it.
*  You know, I just kept wondering about the accuracy of the tennis in it.
*  I think they did really good actually.
*  I think for the most part, I thought the tennis was very well done.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like on any level, did those sort of interpersonal rivalries and dynamics ring
*  true for you?
*  So yeah, I thought it was pretty accurate too about, you know, the tennis player and
*  the relationship that they had.
*  I felt like sometimes you can become really connected to whoever you're with, whether
*  that's a friend, a coach or codependent, I should say is a better word.
*  I feel like I was codependent with Venus.
*  I actually felt like there was so much accuracy in there about things that we don't think
*  about as tennis players or even talk about as tennis players.
*  There's definitely a lot of codependent, I feel.
*  I don't know, it could go both ways.
*  You can also be a loner in tennis.
*  So I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Listen, I like the movie.
*  That's all I can say.
*  But everyone is allowed to have their own opinion.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I also saw this sort of news come out of the Trump trial that you were in the
*  president's contacts.
*  You guys would talk to each other?
*  I mean, is this what this interview is about?
*  So when somebody has a chance to talk to a president, I'm curious what they talk to a
*  president about.
*  I've talked to a lot of presidents.
*  So I spoke to Barack.
*  I spoke to Clintons.
*  I spoke to every president since I've been alive, including Ronald Reagan.
*  I'll have you know.
*  Oh, really?
*  What do you think they're looking for in talking to you?
*  What do they want to know?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not going to go there.
*  Fair enough.
*  You talked a little bit about the idea of your, for lack of a better term, legacy and
*  what you achieved.
*  And it does really seem like in the last few years, there has been this explosion of interest
*  in women's sports.
*  And I think it's inarguable that you were a big part of that.
*  Like, do you feel some sense of responsibility for the position women's sports is in now?
*  No, I would feel that way if it were tennis.
*  And I know it's not linear, but I don't want to be presumptuous.
*  Listen, these women are working so hard at what they do.
*  And you know, whether it's Angel Reese or Caitlin Clark, they deserve the attention
*  that they're starting to get.
*  And I wasn't there.
*  I was doing my own different thing in tennis, right?
*  So I can't sit here and say that it's because of me that women's sport is doing so good.
*  Like, that's just not, first of all, that's not me.
*  And I don't know if that would be 100% accurate.
*  Women's sports athletes have been great for decades and way before me.
*  Chris Everett was great, and Martina Navratilova was great.
*  And maybe it's just the buildup of all that decades and decades of greatness.
*  And then people finally catching on that women are awesome and amazing,
*  and they could just kick butt in sport too.
*  And so, I don't know.
*  Maybe it's just a full compilation of it all.
*  And you know, I am always curious with athletes about the memories that they have
*  from their careers.
*  And do you find that you, I don't know how much you sit back and think about this kind of stuff,
*  but if you do, does your mind go to the big wins or the losses?
*  I'm the kind of person that'd be like, I hated that I lost that.
*  I try to forget my losses, to be honest.
*  You know what?
*  I actually always refused to go down memory lane during my career,
*  because I always said that's when you get satisfied and that's how you not grow and not be better.
*  Because if I'm like looking at me and I'm one like 18 grand slumps,
*  I'll be like, oh my God, that's amazing.
*  Why am I doing this?
*  And so, I didn't want to kind of have that mindset.
*  So, I kind of never really looked back.
*  And with everything going on with Serenity and the Arena,
*  I have an opportunity to look back and say, wow, this has been really,
*  really cool and really interesting.
*  Like to kind of remember that.
*  Ah, it felt good.
*  You know, being the subject of a documentary is obviously something that most people don't get to
*  experience, you know, just seeing sort of your life story played back to you in a narrative fashion.
*  What is that experience like and what were some of the interesting nuances of seeing how someone
*  else like understands what the Serena Williams story is?
*  I am always amazed at people and the excitement they have for what I've done.
*  I'm just like, I'm just a normal person, you know, like I've been so in a box of just like
*  staying focused and just like, you know, just like, I don't know, just doing the best that
*  I could on that day and just that's all I could do.
*  So, now just having an opportunity to hear people talk, you know, about it almost gets
*  me super emotional.
*  And it's just like, wow, I just, honestly, I just didn't know.
*  I just didn't know.
*  Tell me more about that because you were like in it so you couldn't see outside of it or?
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously I knew, but it's also just, I'm so in it.
*  I would literally win Wimbledon and I would go back the next day and tell, not even the next day.
*  I remember having a conversation with my dad being like, okay, dad, so that was great,
*  but I really want to focus on, I know I can win the open.
*  And it's just like, I literally never really took too much time to like
*  settle in and my wins.
*  And I just was always looking for the next quote unquote high, for lack of a better word.
*  And it was always more competition?
*  It was always the next win.
*  Do you still find yourself looking for the next quote unquote high?
*  I have so much more excitement now with just relaxing.
*  And this has been a process of trying to find my new normal.
*  And now I'm like getting to a point where my day to day ends at 12 and I'm like,
*  I have a massage at 130 and it's just like, it's kind of nice to, you know,
*  have an opportunity to just take a deep breath in and deep breath out because I've never,
*  I've never had that.
*  And I've always gone from the next thing, you know, so I'm trying to enjoy this.
*  After the break, I call Serena back to talk tennis rivalries and more about what she's
*  looking for in this next era of her life.
*  Images of me in a stroller on a tennis court.
*  So it's literally my entire life.
*  I've been about one thing.
*  So I don't know anything else.
*  Hi, Serena.
*  How are you?
*  I'm good.
*  How are you, David?
*  I'm good.
*  I'm good.
*  Thank you for taking the time again.
*  I appreciate it.
*  No worries.
*  You know, one thing that-
*  One second.
*  What did you say Olympia?
*  I'll think about it, but yes.
*  Was that Olympia?
*  Sorry.
*  Can you hear me?
*  I'm just with my daughter.
*  So that's okay.
*  What are you guys doing?
*  I'm just with her today because she's out of school.
*  Summertime.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  But-
*  Well, you know, speaking of Olympia, one of the things that you and I had talked about
*  in our first call that I thought was really interesting was sort of the push and pull
*  and maybe some uncertainty you felt about knowing how much to try and put your child
*  on a path towards greatness and how much to push them in the way that, you know, your dad
*  pushed you and your sister.
*  And one thing that I thought more about was, like, what are your husband's thoughts about that?
*  I mean, I assume he wasn't put on a path to excellence in quite the same way as you were.
*  So does he have the same uncertainty?
*  Like, do you guys find you're on the same-
*  Do you both feel the uncertainty about that subject?
*  I need one minute, okay?
*  I'm just on a call, okay?
*  Thank you.
*  Sorry.
*  I'm so sorry.
*  That's totally okay.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard.
*  I actually think it's easier for my husband.
*  So I think it's easier for him to be like, okay, let's go here, golf every week or whatever,
*  and just be more of a, like, motivator than I am.
*  But I'm still trying to find that balance because I tell you, and I always say, like,
*  I wouldn't trade anything that I've done for the world.
*  So why in the world am I not pushing my daughter a little bit more?
*  So I was just trying to figure out my balance of, like, pushing versus over pushing.
*  And I don't think, I think the way my dad did it was good, but
*  I just need to kind of get that headspace sooner than later, you know?
*  Do you find that Olympia responds to being pushed?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't, to be perfectly honest, I don't think I even pushed her enough to see if she's responded,
*  which is disastrous, you know?
*  I'm like, come on, this is crazy.
*  Do better, Strina.
*  So I don't even know the answer to that.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know, something else that was interesting to me was that you had said
*  that you felt like you were codependent with Venus when you guys were on tour together.
*  Can you tell me more about what you meant by that?
*  Because codependency usually has a negative connotation,
*  but my hunch is that you didn't mean that negatively.
*  I don't think so.
*  Oh, so tell me about it.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think so.
*  I think it's good.
*  Like, I mean, codependent is great in some instances, at least in the instance that I meant it.
*  Because we depended on each other.
*  We motivated each other.
*  And I think, I think I can see where it could be a negative connotation,
*  but I also think it could be a positive thing.
*  Like, no one could have pushed me.
*  It wasn't for her.
*  I wouldn't have been pushed so far.
*  She literally pushed me to train harder and to be on the court more than anybody else
*  and to work harder.
*  And that's because, you know, we depended on each other to do that and to motivate each other.
*  So it's definitely more positive.
*  I'm glad you saw that it could have been more positive than negative.
*  So thanks for asking me to clarify that.
*  But yeah, I think that's a positive thing.
*  You know, last time I asked you a sort of insider-y tennis question,
*  and I want to ask you another one.
*  And it's, this is just something I was always personally curious about.
*  So I think Sharapova beat you twice pretty early on in your career.
*  Who?
*  Sharapova.
*  Oh, okay.
*  And then you never lost to her again.
*  I think you beat her something like 18 times in a row after that.
*  Did you just decide like this person is never beating me again?
*  Oh, maybe you didn't see it.
*  I think that's episode three.
*  I don't want to give it all away.
*  Oh, they only showed me the first two.
*  Oh my God.
*  I'm so sad.
*  You'll have to see the rest.
*  It's in there.
*  It's definitely in there.
*  All right.
*  So a teaser.
*  A teaser.
*  It's a teaser.
*  You got to wait for it.
*  It's actually really good.
*  But it is.
*  There was a reason why I didn't lose to her.
*  And I explained that.
*  So that's talking about a bunch of wins that you had.
*  And I know you don't like to talk about losses.
*  Another thing I'm curious about.
*  Okay.
*  So you were so dominant for so long in Grand Slam finals.
*  And then I think you went, oh, for the last four.
*  Did that have to do with the pressure of trying to catch Margaret Court's Grand Slam record?
*  I think so.
*  I think it was pressure and pressure I put on myself.
*  And I should have won at least two or three of those.
*  But there's definitely one or two.
*  One I feel lost for sure.
*  Which I don't think even looking back, I could have won one.
*  At least one of them.
*  But definitely one, two.
*  Or I don't remember the third one.
*  Definitely at least two of them I could have won.
*  And it was just too much pressure I put on myself.
*  And I couldn't relax.
*  I just couldn't relax and be able to just say, and just breathe.
*  And that sucks.
*  Honestly, it does.
*  But nothing I can do about it now.
*  I just, it's not going to change anything.
*  But except for how I feel ultimately.
*  So.
*  How often do you think about not getting 24?
*  Never actually.
*  Oh, good.
*  I never do.
*  Which is good, right?
*  I thought it was much worse than that.
*  But I never do because I had such an amazing career.
*  And quite frankly, I honestly I should have had 30.
*  I feel like I could have had way more than 24.
*  You know, you posted on social media the other day.
*  Oh boy, here we go.
*  A little cryptically.
*  It wasn't cryptic.
*  Then you were ready to hit balls again?
*  What were you referring to?
*  I literally am ready to hit balls.
*  Like I haven't hit in a long time.
*  It's my life and I love it.
*  And I miss it.
*  I miss it so much.
*  I did learn maybe I shouldn't post it on Twitter because people think I'm coming back.
*  And I'm like, no, I literally just sort of wanted some balls.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you and Olympia going to do today considering she's off school?
*  What's the plan?
*  Um, well, we're just hanging out all day and I'm going to play Roblox with her later.
*  We're going to do that.
*  We had a pedicure this morning.
*  And so we're just having a girl's day.
*  Retirement sounds good.
*  It is.
*  It's fun.
*  It's different.
*  It's a life I've never experienced.
*  You have to understand for my entire life since I was, if I can remember,
*  I was images of me in a stroller on the tennis court.
*  So it's literally my entire life.
*  I've been about one thing.
*  So I don't know anything else, you know?
*  And so this is all new to me.
*  It's like a whole new career and it's cool.
*  It's, I have to tell you, it's really cool.
*  And of course I prefer playing tennis, but it's, but you know, that's because I've done it my
*  whole life.
*  Of course you prefer doing something that you've done since you could walk, you know?
*  Like that's kind of rare in a career.
*  Like usually people work to get a career, but I've been doing this since I could walk.
*  So definitely a different feeling.
*  And I think that's natural curve that I just have to, you know, learn.
*  You know, it sounds like you really miss tennis.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  And I like that I miss tennis.
*  I would hate to be like, oh, I hated that so much.
*  And like, that would be such an awful like sad thing for me because tennis meant so much
*  to me and I didn't realize it that much to me, to be honest.
*  And I didn't realize that I would have such an amazing relationship with tennis after
*  it was all said and done.
*  And I love that.
*  I'm really, I'm really happy that I have that relationship.
*  It's like a goodness.
*  It's like a good, it's like a nostalgia, but you know, nostalgia is positive.
*  So I love that.
*  That's Serena Williams.
