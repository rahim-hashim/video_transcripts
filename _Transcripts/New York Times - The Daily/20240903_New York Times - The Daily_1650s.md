# The Push to Ban Phones in School
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZ7iDCUrBI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernusi, and this is The Daily.
*  As students around the country head back to school, many are encountering a new reality,
*  bans on their use of cell phones.
*  Today, my colleague Natasha Singer on the growing crackdown and the contentious debate
*  that it has prompted.
*  It's Tuesday, September 3rd.
*  Natasha, welcome back to the show.
*  Thanks so much for having me back.
*  So Natasha, as long-time listeners of the show will know, you cover technology in schools.
*  And we wanted to have you back on the show today because this is the week that many kids
*  across the country, including here in New York, are going back to school.
*  And you've been reporting on a growing debate that's really become the talk of the new school
*  year.
*  Tell us about it.
*  We're seeing this incredible wave of one state after another trying to crack down on
*  students' cell phone use in schools.
*  And because so many states are passing these laws so quickly, it has become the back to
*  school story, students and cell phones.
*  And it started last year when Florida was the first state to pass a law that barred
*  students from using their phones during class time.
*  And this year, we've seen at least eight states, both red states like Indiana and blue states
*  like Minnesota, pass laws that either restrict student use of phones, like ban them during
*  class, ban them during the entire school day, or require school districts to limit student
*  use of the phones.
*  Teachers say students are spending so much time on their phone that it detracts from
*  learning and that teachers are spending so much time getting kids to put down their phone
*  that it detracts from teaching.
*  So this is really the education world really starting to try to get its head around, you
*  know, what has really become kind of a scourge in American life, which is phone addiction
*  and, you know, this problem that we all in some ways struggle with.
*  We had the Surgeon General on a few months ago, and he thought kids' access to the internet
*  and to social media had become so pernicious that he was actually recommending warning
*  labels.
*  I think it definitely taps into mounting anxiety in the United States that cell phones are
*  contributing to mental health problems among young people.
*  And there are certainly studies showing that kids who spend an unhealthy amount of time
*  online compulsive use of social media and phones is associated with depression and isolation
*  and thoughts of self-harm.
*  I don't think we have evidence that is actually causal.
*  So I think there's a major question here as we're putting these phone bans in effect,
*  but the practical problem in schools is the phones are detracting from learning.
*  And that is something that every teacher says.
*  I mean, honestly, this seems kind of like a no-brainer.
*  I mean, banning phones in school seems basically like something that for the most part everybody
*  would agree with.
*  It does seem like a no-brainer.
*  And there are a lot of folks in favor of it, but there's also a lot of debate.
*  And so, for example, we see that the majority of parents in surveys say that they agree
*  that cell phone use should be limited, but 50% of parents say that there should be some
*  cell phone access during school.
*  And while the laws are happening really quickly, the larger discussion is far from resolved.
*  And that's why we're all talking about it, because people have such strong views on all
*  sides.
*  Okay, so these bans are becoming law really quickly, just over the past year.
*  But these debates over kids and cell phones and technology in schools have been happening
*  for a very long time.
*  What's the historical precedent here?
*  It starts in the 1980s when there's a boom in the illegal drug trade and kids are using
*  pagers and phones to sell and buy drugs.
*  And you see schools in the 1980s begin to ban students from bringing pagers and cell
*  phones to school premises, right?
*  It's not like you keep it in your bag, you can't bring it into school.
*  And then as more and more kids get phones in the 90s, they're ringing in class, they're
*  beeping in class, and it becomes a distraction.
*  And so on top of the drug stuff, you see schools ban them as a distraction.
*  And then in 1999, there's the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, and
*  students are killed, and it's devastating.
*  And it's really the first mass school shooting that is on the radar of American culture.
*  And education changes, and school security changes.
*  And along with that, parents now want to be able to get hold of their kids during an
*  emergency and schools lift the cell phone bans.
*  Because suddenly, every parent wanted to be able to reach their child in an emergency,
*  and that made perfect sense to everybody.
*  And then cell phones change, right?
*  Suddenly they become these powerful mini computers.
*  And so you have kids walking around school with these powerful devices, and they are
*  completely fixated.
*  They're scrolling, they're clicking, they're liking photos, they're filming, they're posting
*  photos.
*  And it becomes another major issue in schools.
*  So this is where we start to see the pushback over tech.
*  This is starting to sound familiar, right?
*  In our current time, concerns over screen time, how addictive these phones really are,
*  and a growing concern over what that means for young people.
*  I think that's absolutely true.
*  The iPhone and social media change everything.
*  And in the middle of that concern increasing, the pandemic happens.
*  And because we were isolated, and because many schools were closed, now you have a whole
*  generation of elementary, middle, and high school kids at home, essentially left to their
*  devices.
*  Schools are ever more reliant on technology, and kids, their parents may be working, their
*  parents may be somewhere else.
*  They are using their phones more to entertain themselves, to talk to each other.
*  They become much more virtually dependent.
*  And then when the pandemic is over, they come back to school with a different relationship
*  to technology and a much more virtual life than they had before the pandemic.
*  Okay, so the pandemic supercharges this connection between kids and their technology.
*  What's the result of all of this?
*  What happens?
*  The result is that you have students coming back to school, many of whom are more comfortable
*  on their phones talking to each other through group text message, more comfortable learning
*  online than in person.
*  And that worries parents and child psychologists and teachers because you not only see more
*  distraction, but one of the things that happens is there's a growing concern that there has
*  been technology overuse and that the two together, phones in school are combustible and a detriment
*  to learning.
*  So you see a pushback among teachers, among some parents to try to limit phone use or
*  take away the phones in school to enable kids to concentrate more on their schoolwork and
*  have more in-person experiences.
*  Okay, so it sounds like this is the beginning of the movement to ban phones.
*  Where does it start?
*  It started last year in Florida where a Republican state lawmaker named Brad Yeager started worrying
*  about what cell phones and social media might be doing to kids.
*  I have children of my own and teenage sons, so I see it day in and day out.
*  My wife has worked with youth for 10 years not in this high school system.
*  So we see it in and out.
*  And he has five kids and he'd been reading studies about how much time students are spending
*  on their phones and how many notifications they're getting during the school day.
*  We know that there's addiction issues with social media.
*  Psychologists across the country time and time again report the negative effects of
*  social media on our youth.
*  And he wanted to do something and so he introduced this bill.
*  I think this is a common sense bipartisan approach to this.
*  I think that, you know...
*  And even in a Republican state like Florida, it is a really popular bipartisan issue.
*  Rep Yeager's bill passed the Florida House and the Florida Senate unanimously.
*  It becomes a lighthouse state for other states and governors wanting to pass similar laws.
*  So when do things start to happen in those other states?
*  So what happened this year was this spring...
*  Parents listen up, a cell phone ban during class time now coming to your child's school.
*  The governor...
*  Indiana passed a law resembling Florida's.
*  A new law prohibits students from having cell phones on their person during the school day.
*  A ban on cell phone use is now a part of South Carolina's state budget.
*  Louisiana passes a law and South Carolina passes a law.
*  There is a growing list of lawmakers that are pushing for restrictions to cell phone
*  usage in Pennsylvania schools.
*  Pennsylvania and Delaware and Minnesota and Ohio passed laws also.
*  The state of Virginia is cracking down on students using cell phones in public schools
*  with a half million dollar initiative.
*  And then it's become an issue for governors.
*  Governor Glenn Youngkin has issued an executive order to establish cell phone free education.
*  Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, issued an executive order that will require
*  state agencies to create cell phone free education policies for schools to adopt by the start
*  of next year.
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom putting out the call to all school districts to restrict
*  cell phones in the classroom.
*  And then also other governors.
*  Now I'd like to take a moment to talk about cell phones in our schools.
*  Including the governors of California and New York are rushing in to say they too are
*  going to work with their state legislatures.
*  It's hard enough for adults to pull themselves away from cell phones.
*  I can't imagine how hard it is for these young people as well.
*  To pass their own state laws restricting cell phone use in schools.
*  The status quo is not working for our children in particular.
*  It's time to start figuring out solutions here.
*  OK, so this is really happening.
*  It is now a gathering trend.
*  But Natasha, how are states actually doing it?
*  Like, how do you go about banning a kid from using their phone all day and enforcing that?
*  I think that that is the crucial question.
*  And it is really complicated.
*  It's one thing for a state to announce kids can't use their phones at school.
*  And it's a whole other thing for schools to actually stop kids from using their phones during class.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Natasha, you said these bans are very complicated to apply.
*  Walk me through what states are actually doing.
*  Different states have implemented different rules.
*  And then even from schools district to school district, there are these differences.
*  One of the main differences is in some states and schools,
*  students are not allowed to use their phone during class.
*  So they walk into the classroom and they cannot use their phone during instructional time.
*  In other places, kids cannot use their phones from the moment they get to school to the moment they leave.
*  So maybe they're allowed to use it on the school bus.
*  But when they arrive in school, no more phone till the end of the day.
*  And different kinds of rules end up with different kinds of enforcement.
*  So I went last year after Florida passed this new law to see how it was going.
*  And I went specifically to Orange County Public Schools, which is in the Orlando area,
*  because they went further than Florida and banned student cell phone use during the entire school day.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And I wanted to see what that would look like.
*  And I went to visit the school Timber Creek High School, which has several thousand students.
*  It's a huge school and they all eat lunch in a communal outdoor space.
*  Now, at Timber Creek, students were allowed to carry their phones.
*  They were just supposed to keep them in their backpack or turned off and put away.
*  To enforce that during lunch, there were security folks who patrolled lunch,
*  who sat on these black Yamaha golf courts.
*  And if a guard on a golf cart saw a kid take out their phone and start using it,
*  then the kid would get nabbed by the guard, put on the golf cart, driven to the front office,
*  where they have to hand over their phone and put the phone in cell phone jail for the rest of the day.
*  And the student gets like a receipt and then they go off.
*  So that's some pretty aggressive policing of it.
*  Right.
*  And the security guard told me also that he looked at the videos of the hallways.
*  And if students were using their phone in the hallways, which they weren't supposed to do,
*  he would sometimes go to class and take them out of class and take them to the front office to deposit their phone.
*  So that is one way of enforcing a ban.
*  And let me just say that the district was really happy with the outcomes because,
*  like, they got pickleball during lunch and ping pong and kids played twister and talked to each other and had lunch together.
*  And like principal was saying to me before the phone ban, kids didn't even talk to each other during lunch.
*  Right. They just looked at their phones.
*  And so the school felt like and teachers felt like the outcome was great.
*  In other districts, there are rules that you have to put your phone in your locker during the school day
*  or you're required to put it in a lockable bag that's magnetically locked.
*  And you like walk up to school and folks are standing out front and they magnetically lock your bag and you carry your phone in a lock bag for the rest of the day.
*  And then there are other districts where teachers can do what they choose.
*  Right. They have leeway to ban the phones or not.
*  And so I spoke to this history teacher in San Antonio, Texas, and he had bought this hanging cell phone container that he put on the wall from Amazon,
*  which has these pockets and every student has to put their phone in a different numbered pocket at the beginning of class.
*  The pockets are big enough where kids can charge their phone during class.
*  And then at the end of the day, they can collect their phone from the pocket on the wall and go off to the next class.
*  So it kind of the other side of the spectrum of restrictiveness.
*  This is just kind of up to the discretion of the teacher.
*  Right. But you also have to understand that I hear from teachers, parents and kids that there's all kinds of ways around these.
*  Like kids have dummy phones that you put in your locker and you carry your other phone around.
*  So for every rule, there's a way around the rule.
*  So what happens to a kid if they get caught doing that?
*  Again, there are different consequences and different enforcement.
*  In some schools, you get several tries.
*  The first time, you know, you just have to put your phone away.
*  The second time your phone might be confiscated and put in the central office.
*  It may be that like if you are a repeat of violator of these cell phone rules that your phone is confiscated and your parent is called and told that they have to come pick up your phone.
*  There are also lots of offenses kids would do with phones.
*  So if it's a combination of cyber bullying and violating the cell phone rule, you could be suspended.
*  OK, so it sounds like there's lots of variation with these bans and how they work, which I imagine is part of the reason that there's so much debate about them, as you mentioned.
*  What has been the reaction from students and teachers and parents?
*  What are people telling you?
*  Well, it's really interesting because we asked readers to weigh in and tell us what they felt about this.
*  And we heard from more than 1100 parents and teachers and principals and students and teachers are largely positive.
*  And so our school administrators, they were really clear about harms.
*  So that high school teacher in Texas, I told you about, wrote in to say that in his school, kids premeditated fights on their phone.
*  They use text messages to arrange like, we're going to beat up so and so.
*  And then their friends would be there on hand to film the beating before the kid even knew that they were going to be attacked.
*  Right. And so he said to the school, like, let's have kids turn in their phones before they leave the classroom, before they go to the bathroom or something.
*  And so they can't bring their phone to a fight.
*  And he told me that this simple change of asking kids who want a bathroom pass to leave their phone on the teacher's desk has apparently already cut down on the amount of fighting in his school.
*  Interesting.
*  So uniformly, teachers and administrators were really in favor of limiting student access to cell phones during class, unless it is for a specific educational purpose, because there's all kinds of apps and educational games you can play with phones.
*  And so they did stress that they want kids to be able to access those.
*  And what about parents?
*  It is much more divided among parents.
*  Many parents are concerned about what their kids are doing on their phones.
*  They're concerned about social media.
*  A lot of parents talk to me about that their kids were bullied or their kids observed bullying, exacerbated by phones.
*  Kids are videotaping each other going to the bathroom, in the bathrooms and sharing that online.
*  So there are all kinds of reasons parents would like limits.
*  On cell phones in school.
*  However, as we talked about earlier, they do want to be able to contact their kids.
*  And then there are some parents who are concerned about what teachers are doing or what other kids are doing.
*  And they want kids to be able to videotape their teachers or videotape a fight as evidence of problems.
*  So there are all kinds of reasons that some parents do think that kids should have access to their phones.
*  And then often the kids who have adult responsibilities, their grandmother is sick and they take care of them after school, or they have a ill sibling, or they have to work and they have a job to get to.
*  They are often the ones who need their phones more because their boss is calling them to change their shift.
*  Or, you know, they might have to go to the hospital.
*  They might actually need to know things during the day.
*  And there are concerns that if you totally block kids from access to their phones, that that information will be slower or not get to them.
*  And Natasha, what about the group that's going to be most affected by this ban, which is the kids?
*  What do they think about this?
*  Just like schools and parents, teens and children have all kinds of different feelings and different answers.
*  We did hear from dozens of high school students who wrote in, you know, when I asked readers to tell us how they felt.
*  And some of them said they were glad.
*  Some of them said they were taking tough courses and it was really hard to concentrate because other kids were on their phone.
*  Some kids talked about it was really hard to collaborate with their peers because nobody wanted to talk to them on an assignment.
*  They wanted to use their phone.
*  Others felt like it was really paternalistic to be required not to use their phone, that it was not allowing them to self-regulate and to choose the moments when they needed to.
*  And I also heard from kids like, there are worse problems in school.
*  Like a high school student wrote to me from Los Angeles and said, there are drugs in my school.
*  Why aren't they banning that?
*  I had other kids say like, this is a necessary step, but I actually don't think it's going to help.
*  So, Natasha, this brings us to my big question, which is, do these bans actually work?
*  Are they making kids more attentive during class and, you know, reducing the social harms that parents and teachers are all worried about?
*  I think that that is the fundamental question in this snowballing of cell phone bans from school to school and state to state.
*  And I think the answer is, we don't know yet.
*  There hasn't been a lot of rigorous research into the outcomes and results of these kinds of bans in school.
*  And much of the research is much more anecdotal than quantitative.
*  I even got an email this week from a professor at the University of Oxburgh in Germany who just published a new paper examining the research on cell phone bans.
*  And he concluded that the bans can definitely, at least modestly, reduce cyberbullying in schools.
*  But he said, we can't yet say whether the bans concretely boost academic results or improve learning.
*  In fact, he said that school smartphone bans right now are based on subjective beliefs and not on real scientific evidence.
*  And so the question is, if the goal is to try to help kids have a healthier, more creative relationship to technology,
*  then maybe we have to have a bigger, more holistic effort.
*  Maybe we have to do a more intensive job of helping kids think about all these fast moving digital innovations
*  and what their benefits are and what their drawbacks are and how they can think critically about them and navigate them.
*  And I think about that personally because in the summers, I teach high school students, I teach a class.
*  And one of the assignments is they have to pick an app, could be Twitch, could be Instagram, could be TikTok.
*  And they have to both log how much time they spend on them, but also analyze how the apps are designed to keep them spending more time and coming back.
*  And like, did they have anxiety if they didn't check it?
*  What did they like? Did they feel compelled to like that because it was their friends?
*  Did they really like that? Like, let's think about what if instead of rushing to ban phones,
*  we helped kids think about the ways that they might be useful and the ways that they personally might want to limit their use of apps and phones.
*  It's much, much harder to think about how we can give children and teenagers more agency over these powerful tools they use
*  and more ability to ask critical questions about how these devices are shaping and shunting their lives.
*  That's a much more complicated ask than just saying, lock up your phone during class.
*  Natasha, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Sunday, the Israeli military announced it had recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages in a tunnel in Gaza, including a dual American Israeli citizen,
*  Hirsch Goldberg-Pollen, whose kidnapping by Hamas on October 7th was the subject of a daily episode.
*  The military said that the bodies had been recovered on Saturday and that Hamas had shot them at short range, two to three days before they were found.
*  Hamas blamed Israel and claimed more hostages would be killed if Israel continued to try to free them through military means and not through a ceasefire deal.
*  The news brought months of simmering anger in Israel to a furious boil, much of it directed at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*  whom critics blame for dragging his feet on a ceasefire deal that would bring the hostages back.
*  Tens of thousands of workers walked off the job on Monday morning demanding he strike a deal.
*  But in a news conference later that day, Netanyahu brushed aside the demands, doubling down on his refusal to agree to a truce.
*  On Monday afternoon, the funeral for Hirsch Goldberg-Pollen drew thousands of people to a cemetery in Jerusalem, where his mother, Rachel Goldberg, delivered an emotional eulogy for her son.
*  Hirsch, for all these months, I have been in such torment and worry about you for every single millisecond of every single day.
*  It was such a specific type of misery that I have never experienced before.
*  I tried hard to suppress the missing you part because that I was convinced would break me.
*  So I spent 330 days terrified, scared, worrying and frightened.
*  Goldberg had become an international symbol for the struggle to release the hostages.
*  Amidst the inexplicable agony, terror, anguish, desperation and fear, we became absolutely certain that you were coming home to us alive.
*  But it was not to be.
*  Now I no longer have to worry about you.
*  I know you are no longer in danger.
*  She described how her certainty that her son would come back alive had turned to grief and then to a bitter and painful release.
*  Finally, my sweet boy, finally, finally, finally, finally, you're free.
*  I will love you and I will miss you every single day for the rest of my life.
*  But you're right here.
*  I know you're right here.
*  I just have to teach myself how to feel you in a different way.
