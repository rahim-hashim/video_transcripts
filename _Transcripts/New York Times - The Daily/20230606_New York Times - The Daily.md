# The Fight Over Phonics
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aerQQFrBbPQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  The New York City Department of Education says in 2019 only 53 percent of third grade
*  students were proficient in reading.
*  That rate fell to 49 percent in 2022.
*  That is why the city says it announced plans today to dramatically change the way children
*  are taught to read.
*  A few weeks ago, the nation's largest public school system, New York City, abandoned its
*  current system for teaching kids how to read.
*  This is not just in New York.
*  This is all across the nation.
*  Eighty percent of the kids in Chicago do not read on grade level.
*  In Detroit, 91 percent do not read on grade level.
*  It was the latest and biggest acknowledgment to date that a generation of American students
*  has been given the wrong tools to achieve literacy.
*  This is a national problem and it's the educational crisis of our time.
*  Today, my colleague, Dana Goldstein, on the influential educator who helped create those
*  flawed tools and is now trying to fix the problems that they created.
*  It's Tuesday, June 6th.
*  Dana?
*  Good morning, Michael.
*  Good morning.
*  I can see that you've brought some books and I think we're going to need them.
*  So thank you for doing that.
*  We're here to talk about how kids learn to read in the United States.
*  And so to begin with, I think it would be useful for you to define and demonstrate the
*  big schools of thought that exist in American education about the best way to teach kids
*  to read.
*  So if you'll indulge us.
*  Yes.
*  Well, probably the dominant way over the past few decades has been a school of thought called
*  Balanced Literacy.
*  And Balanced Literacy really focuses on letting children choose those books that they gravitate
*  toward, giving them a lot of time to read quietly by themselves, having children sort
*  of really focus on the meaning of stories, what happens in them, and really look a lot
*  at the pictures, even use the pictures to guess the words on the page.
*  Okay.
*  Let's demonstrate Balanced Literacy through this delightful looking book in front of us.
*  Yes.
*  It's called Mixing Colors.
*  My five-year-old daughter brought it home from her classroom, which has a Balanced Literacy
*  library in it.
*  And let's go ahead and open the book.
*  It has a big splotch of red paint, a big splotch of yellow paint, and then it shows them mixing
*  together to form orange.
*  Right.
*  If I can read it, it says, red and yellow make orange.
*  Yes.
*  And there's a few things I would just call your attention to about this page.
*  First of all, you can kind of guess what the words will be by the colors, right?
*  I mean, five-year-olds, six-year-olds in kindergarten, they know their colors already, and so they
*  very little even need to look at the words to get to this.
*  I think my two-year-old son would say red, yellow.
*  Yeah.
*  The other thing I would point out is, while the concepts of the colors are very easy,
*  the words themselves are really hard for a kindergartener.
*  Yellow is a really hard word.
*  It has some irregular pronunciations, and so is orange.
*  Okay.
*  The second method.
*  Yes.
*  This book is part of a set that's based on something called the science of reading, and
*  it heavily focuses on phonics.
*  The science of reading and phonics are ways that teach children to read through a really
*  sequenced introduction to the sounds and letter combinations that make up the English language.
*  So we wouldn't be introducing the word yellow, for example, before we do cat, dog, and other
*  very simple words like that.
*  That teach us what those consonants and vowels do.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay.
*  So we're opening up this book.
*  Yep.
*  The book is called Sam, and the purpose of this book, as we'll notice, is really to teach
*  that the letter A in many cases says ah.
*  So page one says Sam and cat.
*  So it has three different uses of A saying ah in three different words.
*  Sam and cat.
*  Yeah, and let's just do one more page.
*  Matt and cat.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And there's no way I would know that that fellow is Matt, because he's not a splotch
*  of red paint.
*  Yeah.
*  You would not know that his name was Matt if you didn't read the book.
*  Okay.
*  So to summarize, balanced literacy focuses more on stories, context, illustrations.
*  It's learning to read a word by considering the meaning of the story and what word might
*  fit into the themes and the images on the page.
*  By contrast, science of reading includes a big dose of phonics, which is to say a kid
*  learns the letters' sounds, the consonants, vowels, the common combinations that we talked
*  about like ca for cat, and therefore is going to sound out the words rather than try to
*  rely on contextual clues.
*  You got it.
*  The two schools of thought represented by these two books, balanced literacy on one
*  hand and the science of reading on the other, have been battling it out in this country
*  for decades as to which is the best method, the right method for teaching young children
*  how to read.
*  And reading, of course, is the most fundamental skill of all schooling.
*  Reading is the first thing kids need to do when they get to school.
*  And what's happening right now is a big and important reckoning over which of these methods
*  is right and which is wrong.
*  And how did we get to this overdue moment of reckoning?
*  Let's start in the 1960s.
*  At that time, there was really no settled way to teach children how to read.
*  But in the late 1960s, early 1970s, something was happening in education in the counterculture.
*  And it was this idea that all learning should be based on the child's curiosity, that children
*  could sort of naturally figure it out on their own if given the right environment.
*  And one person in particular really embodies that school of thought and came to be a real
*  leader in the United States with this idea.
*  And her name is Lucy Calkins.
*  And what should we know about Lucy Calkins?
*  Lucy Calkins grew up outside Buffalo.
*  She was one of nine children.
*  And although her parents were doctors, they also maintained a working farm.
*  And they put the kids to work on the farms.
*  It's a bit of an eccentric family.
*  Or idyllic, depending on your view.
*  Yeah.
*  Lucy Calkins was really hard.
*  And she learned how much a child can really do because her and her siblings were expected
*  to care for these animals.
*  And she always was really interested in teaching.
*  So do you mind if I ask you some biographical questions?
*  No, just go ahead.
*  I'm all set to do it.
*  I know you got started.
*  And over the course of my reporting, I had the opportunity to interview Professor Calkins
*  and speak to her about how she got started in teaching and how she came to develop her
*  ideas about how children learn.
*  I wanted to be a good teacher.
*  I taught with fervor.
*  But I didn't know what I was doing.
*  And I needed to know more.
*  And in the early 1970s, she decided to go apprentice herself in the elementary schools
*  in England.
*  And the reason she wanted to do that is because they were known as being at the forefront
*  at that time of progressive child-centered education.
*  The idea that children's curiosity could really drive learning, that teachers were
*  guides to develop kids' curiosity, not that teachers had all the answers or the adult
*  was the real leader of the classroom.
*  So the opposite of the teacher with the stick at the front saying, like, look at the chalkboard
*  and this is what we're doing.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's exactly what Lucy Calkins wanted to get away from.
*  So I flew to Heathrow and hitchhiked, stuck out my thumb and hitchhiked to Oxfordshire.
*  So she goes over to the UK and she's in Oxfordshire.
*  And she absolutely falls in love with the type of teaching that she sees in those elementary
*  schools.
*  So the teaching was a kind of a simple, highly structured kind of really workshop so that
*  the teacher could be responsive.
*  Kids were deeply engaged in projects.
*  There was an emphasis on craftsmanship and care.
*  Like for example, she told me about watching children just arrayed in front of a mushroom.
*  They would have the kids very painstakingly observe the mushroom and try to draw it with
*  great accuracy and careful, invested, deep work.
*  And they spend an hour just looking at the different parts of the mushroom and sketching
*  it in their notebooks and coloring it in.
*  This is very 60s, 70s.
*  Yes.
*  Creative.
*  And I think there's definitely a strong appeal to this.
*  I think about, say, taking my five-year-old to the park and she might say, look at this
*  flower and we can talk about how the sun and the rain help it to grow and notice how many
*  puddles it has, its color.
*  So of course, children's curiosity does drive a lot of their learning and there is an intuitive
*  truth here.
*  So what emerges from this experience that Lucy Calkin has in the UK?
*  Well, what eventually comes out of this is a strong philosophy that she has, a theory,
*  that children can use these curiosity inquiry-based methods to learn anything, including how to
*  read.
*  Okay.
*  So how does she proceed down this path?
*  Interestingly, she gets her PhD in teaching children how to write, not how to read.
*  And she does something in writing education that is really revolutionary.
*  You know, prior to the work of Lucy Calkins and colleagues of hers, a lot of teaching
*  children how to write was really rote.
*  It was boring.
*  It was about spelling, grammar, penmanship.
*  And while those things are important, they might not have really sparked kids' desire
*  to write all that much.
*  And what Lucy Calkins did is she took the concept of sort of a graduate school writing
*  workshop for adult writers where you keep a journal, you practice writing about your
*  life.
*  And she said, let's have elementary school writers do this.
*  And what was really interesting about this is that when elementary school kids were given
*  writers' notebooks and journals and they were encouraged to write without focusing
*  too much on stuff like spelling, many of them really could do it.
*  So this worked.
*  Yeah.
*  For many kids, not for all, but for many kids, it did work really well.
*  And teachers absolutely loved this.
*  Lucy Calkins, through the 80s and 90s, she became so beloved for her writing workshop
*  technique for young children.
*  But she starts to hear more and more from teachers.
*  And she notices herself when she's going across the country training educators that for kids
*  who struggle with writing, reading is really at the core.
*  That reading is the fundamental skill that they need to get down if they're going to
*  become great, enthusiastic writers.
*  So she decides that she wants to start exploring, creating her own approach to reading, something
*  that would draw upon what she sees as the strengths of what she did with writing, something
*  that centers the child, lets their curiosity guide the curriculum, and gives the student
*  a lot of free choice in what they read.
*  And so at that point in the late 1990s and early 2000s, she begins to branch out into
*  the teaching of reading.
*  So what happens when she brings this approach to reading?
*  So she comes out with a book in the early 2000s called The Art of Teaching Reading.
*  And it very much calls back to her earlier work on the art of teaching writing.
*  She takes a workshop approach.
*  She gives children a lot of free time in the classroom to sort of pick books and quietly
*  read.
*  She starts doing this in kindergarten.
*  Kindergarten students, for the most part, cannot read.
*  So what they're doing quietly when they are quote unquote reading is really just flipping
*  the pages and kind of looking at the pictures and the words, not actually reading.
*  And she has a real approach to sounding out words or phonics.
*  She's skeptical of it.
*  Interesting.
*  She acknowledges that phonics is part of learning to read.
*  But rather than sort of spend a lot of classroom time teaching children the correspondence
*  between the letters on the page and the sounds we hear in spoken language, she cautions that
*  doing this in too structured of a way is really going to turn kids off.
*  And she even says if a kid is struggling to correctly read the word, don't have them sound
*  out the letters.
*  That's not how you should prompt them.
*  Instead, you should have them flip back through the pages of the book, consider the meaning
*  of the story, look at the pictures, and think about what word could be right.
*  Really interesting.
*  This approach is fundamentally not about phonics, maybe even a little anti phonics.
*  She might resist that if you said it that way, because what she'll say is I always said
*  there was some place for it.
*  But that's really not what teachers took from her writing and from the speeches she gave.
*  They took from her writing and the speeches she gave that focusing too much on phonics
*  was going to harm children.
*  They should be thinking about the meaning of stories.
*  They should be enjoying the pictures on the page.
*  When they struggle, they should guess.
*  Guess what the word is based on the meaning of the story and the pictures that they see.
*  Don't labor over the letters in the word.
*  Okay, so how influential does this approach that Lucy Calkins is, it sounds like pioneering
*  become?
*  Very influential.
*  And as balanced literacy grows and Lucy Calkins curriculum materials spread out across the
*  country, there's a big upside for her.
*  She's in business.
*  She is.
*  And in addition to being a professor at Columbia University, she has two private companies,
*  a domestic private company and a foreign one that sell these materials and sell teacher
*  training across the United States and around the world.
*  And by the early 2000s, it becomes the primary way that teachers and graduate schools of
*  education are taught to teach children how to read.
*  And it becomes the way that probably about half or more of American elementary schools
*  teach kids.
*  And to give you an example of how much success she's having selling this curriculum, New
*  York City, the largest district in the country, which educates one million children in the
*  early 2000s under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, actually mandated that schools use Lucy Calkins
*  methods and materials.
*  Wow.
*  So to call back to the beginning of our conversation to the degree that there's been a big long
*  battle in this country over the right way to learn to read between the science of reading,
*  this phonics based approach and balanced literacy, this Lucy Calkins approach.
*  It sounds like around this point, by the time New York City is adopting this in such a profound
*  way, as are so many other districts, that Lucy Calkins approach, balanced literacy,
*  is winning.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  That's true.
*  But while she was pushing this out across the country and it was wielding so much influence
*  and so many teachers and students were falling under its sway, there was something else happening
*  that was really casting doubt on whether this was truly the best way to teach children how to read.
*  So Dana, tell us about this doubt that's starting to emerge about balanced literacy and Lucy
*  Calkins now very popular bestselling approach to how to read.
*  Yes, well there were always voices in dissent to her approach and to the balanced literacy
*  philosophy.
*  And a really important group of dissent were parents of children with dyslexia.
*  They were saying, my kid is not learning how to read in school.
*  I went out and I had to pay with my own money for really expensive tutoring.
*  And guess what the tutor did with my child?
*  What?
*  Taught them phonics.
*  Interesting.
*  And all of a sudden my child, who was diagnosed with a learning disability and was really
*  struggling, is at least able to get the basics down, is able to read.
*  And why should I have to pay for this?
*  What about parents who can't afford to pay?
*  Schools you have let us down.
*  Interesting.
*  But those parents were sort of seen as squeaky wheels, advocating for their particular children
*  and perhaps they were asking for something that wasn't right for the general group of
*  learners.
*  Got it.
*  And I think school districts saw it as a niche request to a large degree.
*  So you're saying dissent and doubt a little bit gets disregarded and maybe kind of bulldozed.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Now here's a really interesting thing.
*  During around the 1990s, functional magnetic resonance imaging, the MRI machine, allowed
*  researchers to look at the brain of a reader, of children learning to read, of adult readers,
*  and it really shed a lot of light on how it is that reading takes place in the brain.
*  And what did it find?
*  It found that while we're reading, we're using a lot of those parts of our brain that
*  we use for speaking and listening.
*  And those parts are doing the hard work of connecting those letters and words on the
*  page to what we all do naturally know how to do as human beings, which is to speak and
*  to listen to language.
*  And that's what reading is.
*  Reading is the work of connecting letters and words to the sounds of spoken language.
*  So that is an understanding of reading as being profoundly auditory.
*  And from what you've been describing of Lucy Kalkin's work, she has deliberately de-emphasized
*  that notion of sounding out words in a rigorous way.
*  Yeah, the MRI machine made a really helpful intervention here.
*  It gave us some really big clues that leaving out the sounded out piece, the phonics piece,
*  was going to really do children a disservice.
*  So by the time Lucy Kalkin's reading curriculum is becoming ascendant and adopted in places
*  like New York City, Dana, as you have told us, there's actually anecdotal evidence that
*  it's not working for key groups of kids like those with dyslexia.
*  And then this scientific evidence that the entire approach is basically kind of wrong
*  based on how the human brain works and how we learn to read.
*  Right.
*  And what happens over the past, say, six or seven years is that the doubt grows and grows
*  due to a few key developments.
*  First of all, there's all of these test scores coming out that are showing that it's just
*  so persistent that about a third of children in America do not have basic reading skills.
*  And from a civil rights perspective, although all children are affected by these reading
*  They cut across class, they cut across race.
*  It is the fact that low income children are affected most by these problems.
*  And so there's a real equity issue here too.
*  And so people are frustrated.
*  And so that draws more people to learn about the science of how kids learn to read and
*  become familiar with this doubt that exists about balanced literacy.
*  I think scientific research on reading has progressed enormously and has yielded findings
*  that are absolutely rock solid.
*  And there are some really important writers and thinkers that start to speak out.
*  One of them is Mark Seidenberg.
*  He publishes a book called Language at the Speed of Sight.
*  And what this book does, he's a cognitive scientist, it tries to bring that cognitive
*  science to educators.
*  A child who's learning to read already knows something about spoken language quite a lot.
*  And their immediate problem is to figure out how print relates to spoken language.
*  And he goes out and he really gets quite a lot of attention for this book.
*  For a long time, no one really knew how children learned to read.
*  It was more debates among people who had philosophies.
*  And there's a crusading journalist.
*  Her name is Emily Hanford.
*  She's an audio journalist with American Public Media.
*  She starts to publish a series of audio documentaries about kids with dyslexia, about how we learn
*  to read.
*  Schools think they're teaching kids to read.
*  Of course they do.
*  But it turns out there's a big body of scientific research about reading and how kids learn
*  to do it.
*  This research shows there are important skills that all kids need to learn to become good
*  readers.
*  And in lots of schools, they aren't being taught these skills.
*  And many, many people listen to this in the education world.
*  Teachers are sort of emailing these podcasts to each other and saying, oh my gosh.
*  And this is a real emotional time for teachers who are for the first time, some of them after
*  20, 30 years in the classroom, being exposed to cognitive science on how kids learn to
*  read.
*  And many teachers I've interviewed have described to me a sort of nagging sense that something
*  was off.
*  That they had used these balanced literacy methods the best way they knew how, that they
*  had really enjoyed going to those summer training programs with Lucy Culkins.
*  They admired her.
*  They loved reading her books.
*  And for teachers who just had that feeling maybe that they weren't reaching all the kids
*  that they wanted to reach, who tried their best for years to find out that all this time
*  there was powerful persuasive evidence that other methods are more effective.
*  It was devastating emotionally, psychologically devastating for many educators.
*  What you're describing, Dana, sounds like a huge clash in the making.
*  All these teachers and parents learning that the way they have been teaching or that their
*  kids have been taught to read was wrong or off through this podcast or through this cognitive
*  psychologist.
*  And yet Lucy Culkins curriculum is still being taught across the country.
*  So at some point that clash does arrive and it must be kind of spectacular.
*  Yes.
*  You note the problematic use of balanced literacy and I have experienced that firsthand both
*  as a mom and a legislator.
*  Over the past five, six years, a major change has occurred.
*  Having been an educator and having many of us on this conference committee, it is amazing
*  how trends cycle through and they're not always good trends.
*  More and more policymakers were clued into this debate that was going on about the science
*  of reading.
*  So today I'm calling for a renewed focus on literacy and on the way we teach reading
*  in the state of Ohio.
*  And dozens of states started to pass laws actually requiring that structured phonics
*  be taught in elementary schools.
*  Y'all, we don't have a science-based reading curriculum in this school district.
*  We don't teach children phonics.
*  And dozens of school districts began to pull Lucy Culkins curriculum out of classrooms.
*  Did you read about the Mississippi miracle yesterday?
*  That Mississippi's reading scores have shot way up.
*  We see it in places like Mississippi, Washington, D.C.
*  You know, as a representative of NAACP, we look at this as a civil rights issue.
*  Our kids have to be able to read and it has to start with the state.
*  It's in the state constitution that kids are supposed to get education in California.
*  Oakland, California, where the NAACP was crucial in asking that Lucy Culkins curriculum not
*  be used anymore.
*  Wow.
*  A real coalition of people, left, right, civil rights groups, educators, parents coming together
*  to push for change.
*  In New York City, more than half of our students are not on grade level.
*  And in a sign of just how big the shift is, New York City, Lucy Culkins' hometown, the
*  first big district to really embrace her approach.
*  Phonics and phonemic awareness has been missing in far too many of our schools and we're going
*  to fix that.
*  Has decided that her materials are no longer on the approved list of ways to teach kids
*  to read in the country's largest school district.
*  A huge blow to her curriculum and I have to add to her reputation.
*  Massive.
*  This puts a lot of pressure on Lucy Culkins and the product which she is trying to sell,
*  which is a reading curriculum that does not include much phonics.
*  So what does she do?
*  After initially resisting and fighting back, a huge turn happened.
*  She starts to acknowledge that she hasn't done maybe quite as good of a job as she could
*  including the science of reading and phonics in her curriculum.
*  And about one year ago, she made an even bigger change.
*  She created a version of her curriculum which for the first time included daily structured
*  phonics lessons and that is now for sale across the country.
*  So she recognizes that she has missed a pretty big boat here in the story of how American
*  kids learn to read and she adjusts in a way that I imagine given the philosophy that you've
*  been describing here, given her background, that experience in England might have been
*  very humbling and difficult.
*  I think it was really, really painful for her and last year I did get the opportunity
*  to have a really long interview with her about her process and coming to terms with this
*  and probably the biggest question I had was given there has been science suggesting that
*  phonics is really important for children, the MRI research, but even prior to that,
*  dating back to the 1960s, how is it that it's only been in the last few years that she made
*  this change?
*  And what does she say?
*  What I feel right now is that the last two or three years what I've learned from the
*  science of reading work has been transformational and has really made me a far better educator.
*  You know, it really wasn't all that satisfying of an answer.
*  She told me that she had clued into this the last few years.
*  Probably after Emily Hanford's first stuff.
*  She mentioned the journalist Emily Hanford.
*  She mentioned Mark Seidenberg, the cognitive psychologist I spoke about.
*  In other words, she was coming across this really powerful research alongside so many
*  members of the public who were encountering it for the first time.
*  That's a hard concept to swallow for a leading educator, perhaps one of the leading educators
*  when it comes to reading, and somebody who works at a major university somehow had blinders
*  on and never heard of this science that said that phonics was essential and her system
*  had fundamental flaws.
*  Do you find that credible?
*  So I really tried to drill down on this with her over the course of several interviews.
*  Before that, were there ever opportunities for someone like you to meet with someone
*  who looks at reading from a neuroscience type of background?
*  How often if ever did that happen?
*  And maybe it never happened, I don't know.
*  Well you certainly can't say that there's not opportunities to do that.
*  One of the things that really came out in our conversation is that she was working very
*  much in the realm of theory and philosophy and ideas about reading.
*  These romantic ideas about child driven learning, the child's curiosity driving the classroom,
*  the teacher being a guide as opposed to sort of the bearer of information.
*  And this was an ideology that was very strong in the part of the academy, the part of the
*  university world that she came from.
*  I don't think that I thought about an MRI machine as part of how you get to know a reader.
*  And as she said to me, she didn't think of MRI machines as a crucial piece of evidence
*  in how kids learn.
*  She said those types of researchers did not spend time in classrooms.
*  That was something that created skepticism for her and many of her colleagues.
*  We spend time talking to teachers, watching kids in classrooms.
*  Those cognitive scientists never go to K-12 schools.
*  They don't know what an elementary school is like.
*  There was a sort of resistance there to accepting that those experts had much to say about what
*  schools do.
*  All of that makes a certain sense, Dana, but I'm mindful of what you said about Lucy Calkins,
*  which is that she's selling a curriculum.
*  So isn't it possible as well that this is a person who resisted absorbing evidence that
*  her curriculum was wrong because she made a lot of money selling that curriculum?
*  You know, I can't look into her soul and know what drove her.
*  I think that we all know that when our economic interests align with something we believe
*  in really deeply, it's going to be really, really hard to doubt that.
*  Right.
*  Doubly hard.
*  So difficult.
*  And I think that's what happened here.
*  But where I will give her credit is that there are other leaders in the balanced literacy
*  world who have not made the changes that she has made and have not even acknowledged, even
*  up till now, 2023, that anything was wrong.
*  How does Lucy Calkins, and I'm sure this came up in your conversation with her, think about
*  the concept of accountability here?
*  Because according to the science and research, she and those she worked with have led lots
*  and lots of kids astray.
*  Does she feel guilty for basically leading so many people to embrace a form of the teaching
*  of reading that we now think has been somewhat discredited?
*  I pushed her on this.
*  I asked her about it.
*  You know, some critics, they want something more like an apology.
*  Some teachers have said to me there needs to be almost like a national reckoning or
*  grieving process for reading issues in the country.
*  I think that people who have supported ONIX first would be wise to learn from others.
*  And that, sure, they could apologize for not trusting teachers, not giving kids important
*  engaging projects to work on, not creating classrooms that are vital.
*  I think that we all of us do the best we can.
*  She turned the question around and she said, actually, I think those who pushed ONIX so
*  heavily owe an apology.
*  Why?
*  She said I think they owe an apology for overlooking the importance of joy, overlooking the importance
*  of writing.
*  Are people asking whether they're going to apologize for overlooking writing, for not
*  inviting kids to bring their own important knowledge and stories to the classroom?
*  Are they going to apologize for not building on kids' strengths?
*  I think all of us are imperfect and we do the very, very best we can and hopefully we're
*  willing to say, you know, I need to keep listening to others.
*  In other words, she sort of drew upon what she continues to see as the strength of her
*  approach as opposed to, I think, you know, truly acknowledging that something was really,
*  really wrong.
*  That's not sounding like someone taking a lot of accountability or sounding at all regretful,
*  which is maybe the case that she's not.
*  She has not personally really offered the apology that many parents and teachers are
*  looking for.
*  And when we decided to do this episode, I did reach back out to her team to ask her
*  if her thinking had changed since we last spoke.
*  And they said no, they referred me back to the interview she already gave me last year.
*  But one big thing that has changed, though, is that these new materials are for sale.
*  And she has told the 15 to 20 percent of American schools that are using her old materials that
*  they should update.
*  And if they want to buy the new stuff, they can get a discount.
*  So even though folks may be looking to her for more of an emotive response, I do think
*  there will be positive change for schools in her network by seeing the fact that she
*  is no longer selling the old approach.
*  From what you're saying, Dana, the result of everything that's happened here, this
*  journey that we've been on that's ended where it's ended, is that dozens, maybe hundreds
*  of school districts across the country are now changing how they teach kids to read.
*  And I have to imagine that's a pretty messy process because you're talking about curriculum
*  that are in place, that teachers have been taught how to use, and I don't suspect that's
*  like flipping a switch.
*  It's really hard.
*  It's really expensive.
*  You don't just have to replace the curriculum materials and the books in the classroom libraries.
*  You have to retrain the adults in the system, some of whom still believe in this.
*  So it's a very difficult shift.
*  So how's it going, and what does it look like in a district like the one we're in, New York
*  City, the biggest school district in the country?
*  Well, I have some personal experience with this.
*  My daughter is finishing up her kindergarten year here in New York City Public Schools
*  in Brooklyn.
*  And at the beginning of the school year, she brought home these books that are really hard
*  for her to read because they don't have sequenced phonics.
*  They're more of a balanced literacy.
*  Yeah, the balanced literacy library books, like Mixing Colors, the one we started out
*  looking at.
*  And it was frustrating to try to read the books with her.
*  Her teacher had asked us to look at them at home, but she was really struggling.
*  She was having trouble sounding out those words because they were a little bit hard
*  for her.
*  But I will say, about halfway through the year, I noticed a huge shift.
*  My daughter's principal is enthusiastic about these changes, and she has been asking teachers
*  to reconsider what they're doing in the classroom.
*  And about halfway through the year, my daughter Talia started telling me CH goes sh.
*  SH goes sh.
*  And just in the past few weeks, she started telling me about what happens when E and I
*  are next to each other or O and U.
*  And so she has absolutely loved this.
*  And I've noticed a huge change in her ability to sound out the words.
*  She's being taught phonics, and it sounds, from what you're saying, like she's now a
*  better reader as a result.
*  Absolutely.
*  She has made huge strides.
*  I have to ask you a complicated question.
*  You're a parent of a kid in the New York City Public School system who, it sounds like,
*  was being taught some of the stuff that now feels like it wasn't really working for a
*  little bit of time.
*  I don't know how long.
*  Do you find yourself mad at Lucy Calkins at all?
*  You're not just a journalist.
*  In this case, you're a parent.
*  You're a New York City Public School system parent.
*  How do you think about that?
*  You know, that's a hard one.
*  As a reporter, I try to stay above the fray and be objective.
*  Of course, as a parent, I'm not.
*  When I'm struggling with my kid to, you know, teach her not to look at the pictures, but
*  to look at the words when she's learning how to read, I have to admit, you know, I feel
*  very frustrated.
*  But at the same time, there were some things Lucy Calkins was right about.
*  Phonics alone is not enough.
*  Kids do need access to books.
*  They need a big vocabulary.
*  Writing is really important.
*  And, you know, for so many things in raising children, we do want to be guided by their
*  curiosity.
*  It's just that learning to read, really learning to read, is hard.
*  And it is not natural.
*  Children cannot teach this to themselves.
*  Phonics is the crucial building block, and Professor Calkins undersold it.
*  Well, Dana, thank you very much.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, there was growing evidence that Ukraine's long-planned spring counteroffensive
*  against Russian forces, which could change the course of the war, may have begun.
*  Ukraine's military undertook a sustained barrage of air and ground attacks along multiple
*  sections of the war's front line, including the Russian-occupied region of Donetsk in
*  Ukraine's east.
*  The march is riding on the counteroffensive, whose goal is to repel Russian forces and
*  liberate Ukrainians living under Russian control.
*  Success could strengthen Ukraine's case for longer-term military commitments from the
*  West and improve Ukraine's negotiating power in any future peace talks with Russia.
*  Today's episode was produced by Muj Zaydi, Will Reid, Ricky Navetsky, and Claire Tensketter,
*  with help from Sydney Harbor.
*  It was edited by Mark George and Liz O'Balin, contains original music by Diane Wong, Marian
*  Lozano, and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvork of Winderley.
