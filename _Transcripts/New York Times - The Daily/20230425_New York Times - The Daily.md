# Fox News Fires Its Biggest Star
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ui9I-7pfjI)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a daily.
*  We have some news from within our Fox family.
*  Less than a week after Fox News reached a historic settlement in a defamation lawsuit,
*  Fox News media and Tucker Carlson have mutually agreed to part ways.
*  The network has abruptly fired Tucker Carlson, an anchor at the center of that case.
*  We want to thank Tucker Carlson for his service to the network as a host and prior to that
*  as a long-term contributor.
*  Today, my colleague Jeremy Peters on exactly why Fox is cutting ties with its biggest star
*  and what Fox will be without him.
*  It's Tuesday, April 25th.
*  Jeremy, you're back very soon.
*  Sooner than perhaps you expected, sooner than perhaps you wanted.
*  Sooner than I think anyone might have expected.
*  So it is 6.26 p.m. on Monday night and four blocks away from here, Jeremy, over at the
*  headquarters of Fox News, there is a mad scramble going on right now because there will be no
*  Tucker Carlson tonight at 8 p.m. as it is always aired because Tucker Carlson has been
*  fired.
*  And I just want to begin by having you put that piece of news into perspective for us
*  As somebody who covers Fox, covers the entire conservative media world, how big a moment
*  this is.
*  It's an earthquake.
*  Tucker Carlson was one of these rare media figures whose power transcended what he could
*  say to his audience because he not only spoke to them, he could speak to the people in power
*  in the highest places of American government.
*  And that included, for a time, the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
*  They corresponded meaningfully and regularly.
*  And Tucker could have an influence on the President.
*  When he wanted his ear, he could have it because Tucker Carlson spoke the language of Trump
*  supporters more intuitively than almost anyone in conservative media.
*  And that allowed him to become one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, hosts
*  on television.
*  And now he's gone.
*  And we're going to get to why he's gone in just a moment, or why we think he is gone.
*  But talk to us about how, once he had this show, Tucker Carlson became this powerful
*  force that you're describing and that has made his departure the earthquake that you
*  just called it.
*  Before Donald Trump bursts onto the political scene, Tucker Carlson is not a terribly influential
*  person in conservative politics.
*  I mean, he's the weekend anchor at Fox.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Which is, we should say, for those who don't obsess about ratings on cable news, not at
*  all prestigious.
*  It's kind of an oblivion role.
*  Yeah, I believe there's a Simpsons joke about this where Kent Brockman, the anchor, gets
*  upset one day and storms off and says, I don't care.
*  Call the weekend guy.
*  OK, so he's not yet Tucker Carlson, as we know him.
*  Right.
*  But the Trump presidency proved to be the biggest stroke of luck in his career yet.
*  His ability to speak to the Trump voter, to their grievances, their anxieties about the
*  way they see their purchase on power in American society slipping away, that is what his gift
*  is.
*  And that allows him to connect with the audience in a way that Fox says, OK, wow, we're going
*  to give you an 8 p.m. slot.
*  It's very prestigious.
*  It's the marquee slot.
*  It was the slot that Bill O'Reilly used to hold when he was at Fox News and was their
*  number one host before he got fired.
*  And once Tucker Carlson has this prestigious platform of 8 p.m. Fox News, what does he
*  do with it?
*  And what makes that formula work so well?
*  It's one of displacement.
*  The theme is, and this is especially resonant with a lot of the older white male parts of
*  Tucker Carlson's audience.
*  You are not wrong to feel aggrieved.
*  Demographic change is the key to the Democratic Party's political ambitions.
*  In order to win and maintain power, Democrats plan to change the population of the country.
*  You are not wrong to think that there is an elite driven plot to replace you.
*  So every time they import a new voter, I become disenfranchised as a current voter.
*  And replace your standing in society with people who do not look like you.
*  Immigration is a means to electoral advantage.
*  It is about power.
*  People who are brown, who are coming across a border.
*  The Democratic Party coddles the mob you see on TV.
*  Our elites fund the Democratic Party.
*  That's how it works.
*  People who are black, who are marching in the streets demanding social justice, racial
*  justice reforms.
*  The Black Lives Matter movement.
*  Exactly.
*  It's very much rooted in a sense of loss.
*  This loss that many Americans felt in their own prestige in American society.
*  Why should I sit back and take that?
*  The power that I have as an American guaranteed at birth is one man, one vote.
*  And they're diluting it.
*  No, they're not allowed to do that.
*  This has a name.
*  It's called the Great Replacement Theory.
*  Yes.
*  And it's been around forever.
*  Tucker Carlson isn't the first to come up with it and to fan fears over it.
*  But he is the most prominent figure in American media to do so to this day.
*  No one had gone up to this line and crossed it the way Tucker Carlson did.
*  I know that the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if
*  you use the term replacement.
*  If you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate,
*  the voters now casting ballots with new people, more obedient voters from the third world.
*  But they become hysterical because that's what's happening actually.
*  Let's just say it.
*  That's true.
*  But he's not just talking about how people of color are a threat to white men.
*  He's obsessed with this threat that he sees coming from within.
*  This idea that American men in general are becoming weak and soft.
*  So there is a huge health crisis in this country, ongoing, has been for decades.
*  It's getting no attention.
*  It's affecting everything else.
*  And it has to do with testosterone levels.
*  He describes this, quote, total collapse of testosterone levels in American men.
*  So we looked into this for a documentary for a Tucker Carlson original series called The
*  End of Men.
*  And he does an entire special on this supposed assault on masculinity in this country.
*  I think the solutions are actually pretty simple.
*  Expose yourself to red light therapy.
*  There's a massive amount of that.
*  Which is testicle tanning.
*  He even talks to an expert who recommended getting your testicles tanned in order to
*  boost testosterone levels.
*  So obviously half the viewers right now are like, what?
*  That's testicle tanning?
*  That's crazy.
*  But my view is, okay, testosterone levels crash and nobody says anything about it.
*  That's crazy.
*  So why is it crazy to seek solutions?
*  So, Jeremy, this framework as oddball and at times racist as it may seem is powerfully
*  resonating with Fox viewers.
*  Can you quantify just how powerfully it's connecting with them?
*  So Carlson quickly becomes the most watched host on the network.
*  Which is the most watched news network in the country.
*  That's exactly right.
*  At times it's even the most watched cable network period.
*  So he gets an average of three million viewers a night, sometimes more, sometimes less, you
*  know, kind of depending on the news cycle at the time.
*  Now when you compare that to the competition, this is leaps and bounds ahead.
*  Over on CNN, Anderson Cooper is getting maybe around a million viewers a night.
*  About a third of what Tucker Carlson is getting.
*  Yes.
*  And this is why Tucker Carlson starts to amass incredible power and influence, not just with
*  President Trump, but with governors and state legislators all across the country.
*  And what are some examples of that power?
*  He basically uses his show to browbeat these elected officials into doing and enacting
*  the policies that he wants to see.
*  Greg Abbott is a governor of one of our most important states, maybe the most important
*  state actually.
*  So take Texas Governor Greg Abbott, for example.
*  Governor Abbott, thank you very much for coming on.
*  One night Carlson goes on his show and grills Abbott.
*  I have a military foresight command, it's called the National Guard, we're going to
*  block the border and save the country.
*  Why didn't you do that?
*  Why aren't you doing that now?
*  Why haven't you used the state's National Guard to stop all these migrants from crossing
*  the border?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Well, lo and behold.
*  Texas Governor Greg Abbott sending 400 more National Guard troops to the El Paso border
*  in an attempt to block the flow of migrants into the U.S.
*  Abbott later says he'll do just that.
*  He sends in the Texas National Guard to the border.
*  I mean, I just want to pause and we've talked about that incident on the show.
*  We actually spoke to a member of the National Guard in Texas about it.
*  What a big deal it is to mobilize your National Guard.
*  I mean, in this case, mobilize your National Guard to act as a kind of like border patrol.
*  That is being prompted not by an outcry from voters or an order from the president, but
*  by a cable news anchor suggesting it.
*  That's power.
*  Indeed it is.
*  Here's another.
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is taking credit for flying two planes carrying dozens of
*  migrants to Martha's Vineyard.
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis sends migrants to Martha's Vineyard in this stunt to say,
*  OK, blue states, see, this is what it's like.
*  You deal with these people.
*  Many did not know where they were going and local officials on the island were not given
*  any advance notice of the flights arrival.
*  That was Tucker Carlson's idea.
*  As of 2019, only 3% of all people, all residents in Egertown were born outside of this country.
*  They are begging for more diversity.
*  Why not send migrants there?
*  In huge numbers.
*  Earlier on his show, he said that residents of Martha's Vineyard, who are almost all
*  Democrats, are, quote, begging for more diversity.
*  Why not send migrants there?
*  Well, that's what DeSantis did.
*  So over and over again, the words come out of Tucker Carlson's mouth and these powerful
*  governors obediently do what he's asking for, which is, I suppose, a measure of their fear
*  that if they don't, his audience will come and punish them at the polls.
*  That's exactly right.
*  They know to be on the wrong side of Tucker Carlson and one of his issues is to risk incurring
*  the wrath of the conservative voter.
*  No one knows this better than Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the House, who almost wasn't
*  the Speaker of the House because conservatives like Tucker Carlson told their followers that
*  he was too cozy with the elite ruling class in business and politics.
*  So to placate Carlson, McCarthy gives him 40,000 hours of previously unseen footage
*  from the security tapes that were running on January 6th.
*  A kind of unprecedented disclosure to a single journalist.
*  And one that many Democrats pointed out risked a real security breach by disclosing certain
*  aspects of capital security that weren't known to the public.
*  And Carlson takes this footage and edits it down to a handful of incidents where you can
*  see the people who had illegally broken into the Capitol walking around peacefully, looking
*  as if they might be on just a leisurely tour.
*  And he says, see, they told you that this was a violent mob, but it's not.
*  And in fact, many of these people just kind of innocently ambled into the Capitol.
*  And in a trick that he has tried time and time again on his show, he says, I'm telling
*  you the truth about what happened here.
*  The mainstream liberal media are the ones who are lying to you and you can't believe
*  them.
*  Here, see it for yourself.
*  Which is not accurate in this case.
*  But the scale of influence we're talking about here is the envy of the cable news industry.
*  I mean, other hosts and other networks, they might not like what Tucker Carlson is doing,
*  but they no doubt wish they had that kind of influence.
*  They wish they had his ratings.
*  And by all accounts, Fox had no problem with what Tucker Carlson was doing for years and
*  years and years.
*  Even when advertisers would get upset, which they sometimes did, they would boycott the
*  show.
*  It was all okay, right?
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, until now.
*  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
*  They knew they had the number one primetime show in cable news.
*  They had a reliable revenue stream, not just from advertisers, though, as you correctly
*  point out, a lot of them boycotted, but from the enormous fees that Fox News is able to
*  generate from subscribers to cable.
*  The breaking point seems to come this year, as Fox News is defending itself against lawsuits,
*  where Tucker Carlson's conduct off air is far more problematic for the network than
*  what he said on the air.
*  And that's what we think pushed his bosses to pull the trigger on his firing so suddenly
*  this week.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jeremy, describe this off air conduct that's revealed in these lawsuits that appears to
*  have contributed to Tucker Carlson's firing.
*  So as of 6 p.m. tonight, there's still a lot we don't know about why he got fired.
*  We do know that it was ordered from the highest levels of Fox and that Lachlan Murdoch, who's
*  the CEO of Fox Corporation, and Suzanne Scott, the CEO of Fox News, decided that they were
*  going to do this on Friday night.
*  They inform Tucker of it on Monday morning, telling him, you're not on the air tonight.
*  Right.
*  No chance to say goodbye.
*  It's over.
*  In fact, in their news release announcing this, Fox says his last show was Friday.
*  His last show was in the past.
*  It's pretty unsentimental.
*  Okay, so back to the lawsuits and the off air comments that have perhaps led us to this
*  point.
*  Well, first, let's start with the Dominion case.
*  The biggest revelation about Tucker Carlson to come out of the Dominion case is that he
*  reveals himself to be something of a political performance artist.
*  He's telling his audience one thing, but because of the emails and texts that Dominion is able
*  to get as part of the case, we know he doesn't believe some of the stuff that he's allowing
*  on his air or telling his viewers that they're right to believe about voter fraud.
*  Much of it relating to the claims that there's election fraud or that Dominion's voting machines
*  played a role in election fraud.
*  We know he didn't believe any of it.
*  We also know from the Dominion suit that he loathes former President Trump.
*  He calls him all sorts of names, questions his judgment, says he can't wait for the day
*  when they no longer have to talk about Trump and can ignore him.
*  And this is the president, Tucker Carlson, has spent years elevating, promoting, and
*  cheering on.
*  And the president, who from what you're saying, is responsible for his success as a TV anchor.
*  Exactly.
*  So that, I think, kind of points to his disingenuousness, that he's going to tell his audience what
*  he thinks they want to hear.
*  And it paid off because he's the most popular primetime host on all of Fox News.
*  Right, but these emails and texts suddenly shake the foundation of that success.
*  They shattered the premise for those who were paying attention, and we're not sure many
*  Fox viewers were, that he is this pro-working class champion of President Trump.
*  Right, but we can assume that people who were on Fox News were paying attention to this
*  lawsuit and to the emails.
*  They were, and I'm told that they were also paying attention to some of the text messages
*  between Tucker and his producers in which they make fun of their colleagues, and they
*  even question the judgment of their bosses.
*  What's an example of that from the Dominion lawsuit where Tucker Carlson and his producers
*  are challenging their superiors?
*  They really take issue with the Arizona call.
*  This is when the decision desk at Fox News got out of the gates earlier than any other
*  news organization to say, President Biden's going to win Arizona.
*  Right.
*  And that was a huge moment because after that, it became very, very difficult to see how
*  Trump could win a second term.
*  Carlson says, effectively, I can't believe these people.
*  Don't they understand the damage that they're doing to this brand we spent years building?
*  And he accuses some of them of being liberal sellouts, people who hate us, he says.
*  Even though they are his colleagues and bosses.
*  That is correct.
*  The lawsuit from Dominion also opens a window into another aspect of his behavior that is
*  alarming to many at Fox.
*  Which is?
*  His misogynistic, especially the vulgar way in which he uses misogynistic language.
*  He says some words I won't repeat here, referring to Sidney Powell, one of President Trump's
*  legal advisors, that made people shudder once they saw them.
*  That leads to a second lawsuit that unfolds as the Dominion case is getting ready to go
*  to trial.
*  Let's talk about this other lawsuit, Abby Grossberg's lawsuit.
*  A producer at Fox News sues Fox and Carlson, alleging that he has created, presided over
*  this incredibly toxic workplace.
*  Women were objectified.
*  Female politicians who came on the show were mocked.
*  It was a game.
*  It was a sport.
*  Where discrimination, sexism, anti-Semitism is all tolerated in a part of the everyday
*  culture at Tucker Carlson Tonight.
*  C word all the time.
*  She talks about a photo pinned up to a wall in the Tucker Carlson Tonight offices of Nancy
*  Pelosi in this plunging bathing suit.
*  This producer also alleges that right before Tudor Dixon, the Republican candidate for
*  governor in Michigan, is set to come on Tucker Carlson's show, they have a mock debate about
*  whether they would prefer to have sex with her, Dixon, or her Democratic opponent, Governor
*  Gretchen Woodmer.
*  So with this second lawsuit, we're talking about some very serious allegations, some
*  very detailed allegations of basically a sexist, hostile workplace and the kind of claim that
*  I have to imagine in a post Roger Ailes Fox News, right?
*  One where the company has already fired a senior executive for sexual harassment, that
*  this stuff gets taken pretty seriously.
*  It does.
*  And part of Suzanne Scott's mission, once she took the helm of Fox News from Roger Ailes,
*  was to make it a more friendly place for women to work.
*  So it's not exactly a good look for her to have her star host and his staff behaving
*  really horribly toward women.
*  Right.
*  So Jimmy, how, based on all your reporting, does everything we're describing here come
*  together in the minds of Fox leadership in their decision to get rid of Tucker Carlson?
*  Because there's a lot here in the mix.
*  So how do you see it?
*  If you look at the history of recent high profile firings of Fox News, Roger Ailes,
*  as you just talked about, he was fired after being exposed as a serial predator of women.
*  Bill O'Reilly, its number one host, fired after multiple women accused him of egregious
*  sexual misconduct.
*  Their firings didn't have anything to do with what was said on the air, what they allowed
*  on their shows.
*  And I think that's important in putting into context what happened to Tucker Carlson.
*  For four years during Trump's presidency, and for two years after, Tucker Carlson said
*  some outrageously inflammatory, racially insensitive, outright at times racist things.
*  And he still had a job.
*  Even when the Dominion lawsuit is unfolding and we see how he privately talked about President
*  Trump and insulted his colleagues at Fox, Fox doesn't fire him then.
*  They fire him after we learn that the workplace he was in charge of was a human resources
*  nightmare and had already spawned one lawsuit and very well could have led to more that
*  we just don't know about.
*  Interesting.
*  So if I can summarize what you're saying here, what gets you in trouble at a place like Fox,
*  which is so fixated on its ratings and its audience, is always at the end of the day
*  not going too far with that pursuit of ratings and that pursuit of audience, but with plain
*  old human resource violations of the most basic kind.
*  That's exactly right.
*  But the big question around firing Tucker Carlson is, is it going to hurt Fox?
*  Maybe their rationale makes total sense.
*  Maybe their lawyers advised them that they needed to do it.
*  But as Tucker Carlson said in one of the text messages that you've talked to me about on
*  this show, when you're Fox, you cannot alienate your viewers.
*  That relationship is sacrosanct and it is delicate.
*  In firing Tucker, is Fox at all risking disrupting that bond with its viewers?
*  They are, but at the same time, they're making a gamble that has paid off for them in the
*  past.
*  Tucker Carlson isn't the first high profile figure at Fox who's been fired.
*  Right, Bill O'Reilly.
*  Glenn Beck.
*  The Tea Party star.
*  And Glenn Beck's sin, along with Sarah Palins, who was also fired by Fox, as a contributor,
*  right?
*  Their sins were that they thought they were bigger than Fox.
*  Fox wants these hosts to know that no one is ever bigger than the network itself.
*  Tucker Carlson thought he was bigger than the network.
*  This is a guy, remember, who's floated as a possible presidential contender.
*  He's quoted on the record saying that no one tells him what to do.
*  He can put whatever he wants, essentially, into his scripts.
*  Well, what Fox News said on Monday is, no, you're not bigger than Fox.
*  Here's the door.
*  And by the way, you are only who you are because we gave you that 8 p.m. time slot.
*  I'm pretty confident, and history has shown, that they can put a relatively unknown, untested
*  person into that very highly rated slot, and it'll probably do well because there's just
*  so many people who watch Fox.
*  And Fox is so good at giving its audience what it wants, it doesn't necessarily have
*  to be Tucker Carlson and the Anchored Share doing that.
*  Right.
*  And that fear being from Fox, we can make you and we can break you and then we can replace
*  you and do the whole thing all over again.
*  And that is something that the Murdochs have always shown they are not afraid of doing.
*  So if we know that there's a Fox without Tucker Carlson, I guess the question becomes, is
*  there a Tucker Carlson without Fox?
*  Well, as is usually the case with multi-million dollar contracts like he has, there's a non-
*  compete, so he will have restrictions on what he is able to do and it may preclude any type
*  of television for quite some time.
*  That doesn't mean that he's done, but in the case of Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly, you
*  don't really hear much about them anymore.
*  I mean, yes, they have shows, they have followings, the loyal diehards who always tuned in when
*  they were on Fox, but that's a much smaller audience now.
*  Right.
*  It's a good lesson for every journalist out there.
*  I mean, what are you without the platform of your news organization?
*  That's the lesson here.
*  It's very humbling.
*  Well, Jeremy, once again, in a very short week, thank you for your time.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, the Republican governor of North Dakota signed a law that will ban almost all
*  abortions after the state's highest court blocked a previous ban from going into effect
*  last month.
*  The law makes North Dakota the 14th state where abortion is currently banned or nearly
*  banned.
*  And in yet another major media firing, CNN has pushed out Don Lemon, a star anchor and
*  co-host of the network's flagship morning show, following on air comments he made in
*  February that were widely criticized as sexist.
*  Lemon had claimed that women like Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley were no
*  longer in their prime after their 20s and 30s.
*  He later apologized, but the Times reports that Lemon's standing fell with both CNN's
*  audience and potential guests, leading to his ouster.
*  Today's episode was produced by Carlos Prieto, Nina Feldman, Rob Zipko, Stella Tan and Alex
*  Stern.
*  It was edited by M.J.
*  Davis-Lynn, Michael Benoit and Lisa Chow.
