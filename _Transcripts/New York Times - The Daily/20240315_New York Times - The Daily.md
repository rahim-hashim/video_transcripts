# A Journey Through Putinâ€™s Russia
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrneKV-wt0A)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Russians go to the polls today in the first presidential election since their country
*  invaded Ukraine two years ago.
*  The war was expected to carry a steep cost for Vladimir Putin.
*  But as my colleague Valerie Hopkins explains, the opposite has happened.
*  Today, Valerie travels around Russia to understand how Putin has done it, and how long that can last.
*  It's Friday, March 15th.
*  So Valerie, the presidential elections in Russia are starting today.
*  And it's the first one since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine two years ago.
*  And back then, you know, there was this idea that the war could potentially become ruinous
*  for Vladimir Putin, both politically and economically.
*  And here we are with Putin running for reelection two years later.
*  So we come to you as our on-the-ground Russia expert to talk about where we are in the arc
*  of President Putin's power.
*  Well, Sabrina, these elections are set to run Friday to Sunday.
*  29 regions are voting online, and some of them have already started.
*  And it's a big event for Putin, but you and I both know very well that elections aren't
*  best measure of the people's choice in Russia.
*  Putin is running once again without any real genuine competition.
*  Some of my friends in Moscow actually just refer to it as the voting.
*  The voting.
*  Because it's not really an election.
*  People are going to vote, but it's not truly a choice.
*  Exactly.
*  Putin is expected to just glide to another six-year term, his fifth, and that puts him
*  on a path to becoming the longest-serving leader in Russia since the Russian Revolution
*  more than 100 years ago.
*  Incredible.
*  And what's so remarkable is that this isn't just a story about an autocrat extending his
*  reign.
*  This is a leader with pretty sky-high polling numbers right now and seemingly broad support.
*  So tell me about that.
*  What is that support?
*  I mean, Sabrina, you and I both know that opinion polls are to be taken with a grain
*  of salt in Russia, especially in a time when repression has become very intense and is
*  only getting stronger by the month.
*  But you know, polls conducted by independent pollsters like the Levada Center, which use
*  focus groups and really big sample sizes, show that Putin's approval rating is at 86
*  percent.
*  Wow.
*  In nearly a decade.
*  86 percent.
*  Yeah.
*  And even the more general question, is Russia going in the right direction?
*  That answer has really shocked me.
*  It's 75 percent.
*  Right now, it's the highest it's ever been since a pollster started asking the question
*  in 1996.
*  That is incredible.
*  I mean, the highest number since the beginning of polling, basically.
*  Yes.
*  And you know, for me, that's really so incongruous because remember, you and I were on the ground
*  in Ukraine when the war started and Russia began being deluged with Western sanctions.
*  You know, one company after another announced they were pulling out.
*  And then slowly it became clear that this war was going to last much longer and be far
*  more deadly than anyone originally expected.
*  I think including Mr. Putin himself.
*  And it seemed like Russia's future was a massive question mark.
*  So looking at the polls now, it's kind of remarkable to see that Putin has managed to
*  get past all of that.
*  And so I really wanted to get out into the country and talk to some of the people behind
*  these numbers to understand what it is that has kept their support for Vladimir Putin
*  so high and how he's been able to defy the expectations that so many people had at the
*  beginning of this war.
*  So where did you start?
*  So a few months ago, I decided to go to the ninth largest city in Russia, Samara.
*  It's a city on the Volga River.
*  And I was interested in Samara because it's a pretty big industrial city.
*  And I really wanted to see how ordinary people living there were feeling about the war and
*  were experiencing all these changes to Russia's economic life.
*  I mean, again, this was one of the big questions hanging over the war.
*  Would it crater the Russian economy?
*  It occurred to me that a really good place to get a feel for that is at the mall.
*  So I went to one downtown with a couple of my colleagues.
*  And I was really interested to go and see what ordinary life is like for people who
*  are doing some shopping or catching a film.
*  Valerie, you are our Russian mall expert, also our Russia expert, but our Russian mall expert.
*  Continue.
*  What did you see in this one?
*  This mall was really interesting.
*  You know, I saw a lot of activity.
*  One thing I have to say I appreciate is that there's a group of young teenage boys who
*  are playing with large size chess pieces, very Russian.
*  There's no empty storefronts.
*  They've all been replaced by new brands from different countries in the world.
*  Some of them Russian, some of them from the Middle East, the Gulf, etc.
*  Let me tell you, Sabrina, that's really different from what I saw in malls, even in central
*  Moscow at the end of 2022.
*  Many Russian, especially young, hip, urban Russians were devastated by the departures
*  of Zara, H&M, McDonald's, Coca-Cola.
*  And these were departures of Western companies because of the sanctions.
*  Absolutely.
*  And you would go to malls and it would just feel like a dead zone.
*  Those shuttered, dark hallways, you could see what was no longer available to you as
*  a Russian consumer.
*  And now all that has changed.
*  But I don't know, there's also a lot of new stores like Be Free and DJ.
*  Like I don't know what that is.
*  Oh, but that's a Russian brand, right?
*  Of course, Zara and H&M have been replaced by stores that we in the States have never
*  heard of, but you could still get a lot of the same goods.
*  It seemed like your average mall, teenagers walking around drinking soda.
*  One of the big questions I get from friends back home is, did you try the fake Coca-Cola,
*  Dobrykola, the new brand that has essentially taken over all of Coca-Cola's business inside
*  of Russia.
*  So I've just bought a Dobrykola.
*  And for the uninitiated, Dobrykola means?
*  Good Cola.
*  Right.
*  Cool Cola.
*  I mean, yeah, I've seen various translations.
*  Good Cola, Cool Cola.
*  Let's see if there's any difference whatsoever.
*  I don't think so.
*  So what is Good Cola taste like?
*  Pretty much like the real thing.
*  Maybe like a normal knockoff Coke.
*  Do you think there's any difference?
*  A little bit.
*  Really?
*  I don't know if Coca-Cola took their secret sauce when they left or not.
*  But I don't mean to paint a picture of a mall full of only knockoffs, you know?
*  I think frankly, I was astonished by the amount of Western goods still available.
*  There were still Chanel.
*  All of the luxury cosmetics and perfume are widely available in Russia.
*  So really what you're seeing is a mall that has actually returned to some semblance of
*  economic normal.
*  Yeah.
*  In the past two years, Russia has been able to really successfully reorient its economy.
*  Consumers clearly still have the money to buy expensive Western products.
*  So they're often paying a huge premium importing them from China, from Kazakhstan, from Georgia,
*  Armenia and the neighboring countries through middlemen.
*  Oh, let's talk to the Apple people.
*  They're selling all the Apple products.
*  Let's find out like how do they get them?
*  Are they more expensive?
*  This became really clear to me once I set foot into a shop selling Apple products.
*  So tell me about that shop.
*  So it looked like an ordinary Apple store.
*  They had all the MacBooks and MacBook Pros and accessories, iPhones.
*  And in fact, when I first went in just to inquire about the price, the salesman that
*  I talked to was really proud to say that it wasn't that much more expensive than the West
*  and that actually they had gotten the latest iPhone model in stock three days only after
*  it debuted in America.
*  Interesting.
*  So what did the guy say?
*  He kind of shrugged his shoulders about the economy, about the sanctions.
*  He said, you know, we have no problems getting any of this stuff in.
*  People are still able to buy it.
*  And he told me that he actually felt very confident that Russia would be able to survive
*  and maybe even thrive economically.
*  He compared Russia to Iran, which has been under sanctions for decades.
*  Not that it's the most economically successful country in the world.
*  His point was that other countries have figured out how to survive economic sanctions and
*  Russia is as well positioned as anyone to do that.
*  I mean, he mentioned how resource rich Russia is.
*  It's one of the world's biggest oil producers and that has already helped it to generate
*  money to keep the economy afloat.
*  So this is one of the keys to Putin's success, right?
*  Keep the people happy with iPhones.
*  Have the stuff still come in.
*  Make sure that they're not cut off from the world in terms of the stuff that they want.
*  Exactly.
*  Standing in this fake Apple store in the Samara mall, the war felt really distant
*  to this guy.
*  You know, he's injured so he couldn't be mobilized, although he does feel bad for some
*  of his friends who are fighting.
*  But he said the war is not really this immediate presence in his life and that his life really
*  hasn't changed at all.
*  And when I thought about it more, it wasn't all that surprising to me.
*  I mean, here we were in a relatively big city and I knew that Russia had been drafting far
*  more soldiers from rural areas around the country than they are from cities.
*  I started to think I needed to go further afield to the more rural communities that
*  are actually bearing the brunt of this war.
*  So my team and I hopped in a car and we drove for hours along a potholed road all the way
*  to a little village called oatmeal.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Valerie, tell me about the town of oatmeal.
*  And is it actually called oatmeal?
*  Well, yes.
*  I mean, in Russian it's Avsyanka.
*  It was a collective farm back in the days of the Soviet Union.
*  In some of the open fields, you can just see like the remains of collapsed infrastructure.
*  But the village of Avsyanka itself provides almost no jobs.
*  Mostly people are working in subsistence agriculture or, you know, hunting for scrap metal, doing
*  odd jobs here and there.
*  I mean, the place is really impoverished.
*  Every year it seems like there's another suicide, which in a really small place takes its toll.
*  It feels like a place with a lot of despair.
*  So really kind of a classic post-Soviet, you know, economically depressed landscape, a
*  place that had been this large functioning farm, this collective farm with the whole
*  village employed in working it.
*  And after the Soviet collapse, that just died.
*  Right.
*  I mean, this is a place that really hasn't seen any of the fruits of Putin's economic
*  success story.
*  And these small depressed villages are the kind of places that have sent a lot of people
*  to this war.
*  So I arrived in oatmeal and went straight to the house of the Kadira family who had
*  lost their son in the war.
*  And I was really interested in how the family would make sense of their loss and of the
*  war and what they thought of Russia in that moment and what they thought of Putin who
*  launched this war.
*  And as we arrived, the family were waiting for his body to be brought by the local military
*  officials.
*  And as we sat cross-legged on the floor of their main room, as mourners kind of trickled
*  in and out to pay their respects, they told me about him.
*  His name was Garipul S. Kadyrov.
*  He was an ethnic Kazakh, like most of his relatives.
*  But to his friends and family, he was known by his Russian nickname, Vitya.
*  He was a soft-spoken farmer.
*  And shortly after Vladimir Putin announced a general mobilization, officials from the
*  military commissariat came to his house and told him he was going with them.
*  And so, you know, his family said that though he didn't expect to be drafted, as soon as
*  he was called up, he said it was his duty.
*  And he went that very day to start his military training.
*  But after just a few months into his tour of duty, he was killed in a part of Ukraine
*  that had been a meat grinder for Russian soldiers.
*  Shortly after we arrived, a military convoy came carrying his body.
*  His mother sobbed most of the day, and one of his sisters was wailing so much that she
*  needed to take sedatives.
*  And just witnessing the pain, it was immense.
*  And then the whole village assembled for a formal ceremony for him with military honors.
*  The head of the district government even came to speak.
*  He gave a patriotic speech about him dying for the sake of freedom.
*  He said it is precisely thanks to guys like him that there are peaceful skies over our
*  country.
*  And by participating in the special military operation, which is what Russia calls the
*  war, they are protecting our freedom, our lives, and the health of our children.
*  So what did the family make of all of this?
*  Well, despite the fact that they had lost their son, their brother in the war, despite
*  the poverty and pain of this small village community, you hear them embracing certain
*  elements of Putin's messaging around the war.
*  You know, many relatives repeated a lot of the shorthand that Putin has been using from
*  the beginning, saying that this was for the good of the motherland, you know, and that
*  this has long been Russian territory, that most of Ukraine has always historically been
*  a part of Russia, that Ukrainians and Russians are actually one ethnic group.
*  One thing that really stuck out to me the most was the fervent belief that this is a
*  war against the West.
*  There was a strong conviction that the West had turned Ukraine against Russia and this
*  was not a war of choice for Putin.
*  And so, you know, I don't think this was purely that they were taking Putin's propaganda
*  wholesale, you know, but you could see a need to make sense of their loss and to understand
*  the tragedy that befell their family.
*  But there is another element in this too, you know, which is something the family didn't
*  really speak about.
*  And that's the fact that, you know, men who often are not able to really provide very
*  much for their families while they're alive know that if they do die, their family can
*  get, you know, somewhere up to 60, 70, $80,000 in compensation payments after their death.
*  Wow.
*  So extremely meaningful for a family like Viches.
*  Absolutely.
*  You know, this is a place where presumably people are, you know, living on maybe the
*  equivalent of a hundred, a couple hundred dollars a month.
*  So these salaries are an incredible boon.
*  And in fact, you know, Putin in his most recent State of Union speech last month actually
*  talked about wanting to elevate the role of soldiers and veterans in society and give
*  them more leadership roles and more opportunities.
*  And you know, this is widely perceived as an attempt by Putin to kind of re-engineer
*  a new middle class comprised of people involved in the war effort.
*  Wow, God, I mean, it's very dark.
*  But it's also quite cunning of Putin, right?
*  That there is an economic element to this war for the people who are dying.
*  And that is something that can blunt any potential political opposition to it.
*  So the people doing the dying are not going to be the people asking the questions in part
*  because this money is coming in and he knows that.
*  Yes.
*  And I mean, Sabrina, I've spoken to other family members who have lost their sons and
*  husbands in this war, and they all say that no amount of money can bring back their son.
*  But it does have an effect of making these families far less vocal and far less prone
*  to uniting in some kind of a protest movement that could challenge Putin.
*  But, you know, Sabrina, with all that being said, the longer I spent time in the Kadyrov
*  house, the more I realized that there were so many layers to this family's grief and
*  that there were people present at the funeral who really aren't on the same page about
*  this war.
*  So tell me about those people.
*  So I had this really surreal reporting experience after this military honor ceremony.
*  The Crimson military issued casket was actually brought into the house where, according to
*  local custom, Vita was to spend one final night at home before being buried in a nearby
*  cemetery.
*  As members of his family gathered around his coffin, they got into a debate actually about
*  why he died.
*  Wow.
*  You know, they're gathered around his casket.
*  Nobody knows what was inside.
*  The members of the family knew that the body had actually been decomposing for some time
*  in the trench before the Russians were able to get it out.
*  So you know, many people were heartbroken that they couldn't wash the body.
*  They couldn't see the body.
*  And I think that drove one of the family members especially to start speaking out against the war.
*  He called the war in Ukraine nonsense.
*  Wow.
*  And then he said, what?
*  Defending the motherland?
*  From whom?
*  He said that he thought the people who believed that this war was necessary had been in some
*  kind of a stupor.
*  He was one of the few people in the family who was willing to say, actually, we attacked
*  Ukraine, not the other way around, you know.
*  Amazing.
*  There were other people around who chimed in.
*  One family member compared it to Putin's annexation of Crimea, saying, you know, what do we even
*  need that for?
*  In other words, like, Russia is already such a vast and huge country.
*  I mean, the biggest one, territorially in the world.
*  Like, why do we need new territories?
*  And this idea of a greater, unified Russia encompassing Ukrainian land wasn't really landing
*  for him.
*  I mean, these are very brave questions, right?
*  You know, saying this also to you, sitting there, an American reporter, like, this is
*  the thing Putin has really been focused on, that people not say things like this, right?
*  And yet there they were, saying these things against the war.
*  This is a really dangerous thing to say to a journalist at a time when the Russian government
*  is really policing all kind of dissenting voices on this war.
*  And the extent of repression in Russia now is so strong that even whispering about them
*  can get you in huge trouble, can land you in jail, can land you with a fine.
*  With my colleague Anton Trinovsky and other members of our bureau, we've been reporting
*  on the way that people have been fined for anti-war scribbles on a bathroom wall or a
*  simple request to a DJ to play a song by a Ukrainian musician.
*  Not to mention people who take the risk of standing in the street with an anti-war slogan.
*  Right.
*  The economy and paying off soldiers is one thing, but repression is really the foundation
*  of what Putin has been up to here.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, that's what holds this whole system together.
*  Right?
*  You know, there are a lot of people in Russia who share anti-war views and who are fed up
*  with more than two decades of Putin in power.
*  But they have very little recourse to do anything to change the situation at this point.
*  We've been reminded of that in the past few weeks in the aftermath of the death of Alexei
*  Navalny, the biggest and most important opposition politician and dissident in post-Soviet Russia.
*  You know, his supporters have shown up to memorials, to his funeral, but everywhere
*  you turn, you're reminded of the repression that still keeps all of them in check.
*  I went to some of the memorials and watched as riot police stood on checking people's
*  IDs and encouraging people not to linger.
*  While I was there, I talked to a 17-year-old student who said he had been too scared to
*  put down flowers because of possible consequences.
*  And you know, he's right to worry.
*  I mean, hundreds of people have been arrested across Russia for the simple act of laying
*  down flowers or publicly mourning Mr. Navalny.
*  Wow.
*  So even in this moment where the opposition may have been galvanized to some degree in
*  the lead-up to Election Day, we're still reminded of the hold that Putin has on Russia.
*  So Valerie, to answer the question you started with, you know, how has Putin managed to keep
*  such a tight grip on things, repression is still central to how he's doing that.
*  But he's also worked extremely hard to keep people happy, right?
*  In malls, with their iPhones, keeping the economy going and also paying out those bonuses
*  to soldiers' families in these very poor areas.
*  And at this moment, heading into his re-election, that's all basically working.
*  That's true, Sabrina.
*  But these are a lot of plates he's spinning, you know, trying to keep the economy afloat
*  while paying huge salaries to military personnel and, you know, revamping the entire military
*  industry.
*  The Kremlin has dipped into reserves to make these financial payments.
*  The economy has changed so much and no one knows how it will be affected in the long
*  run.
*  The oil price could change.
*  And on top of that, the kernel of dissent remains despite this inertia of repression.
*  So, you know, he's of course very much in control, but it's tenuous, right?
*  I mean, for it to work, Putin really needs to keep his eyes on all of these areas at
*  once.
*  Absolutely, Sabrina.
*  I mean, it's a precarious balance.
*  And you know, traveling across this vast country, I've seen the tremendous power and reach of
*  Putin, even if these elections are not legitimate, he's still on the cusp of becoming one of
*  the longest serving leaders in Russia's history.
*  And that is a testament to his tremendous staying power.
*  But you also do see the cracks and the tension here.
*  And so the question is whether these cracks begin to widen or whether Putin will prevail
*  as he has over yet another tumultuous period in Russia's history.
*  Valerie, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has called on Russians who oppose Putin to
*  show up at the polls at noon on Sunday as a sign of collective protest.
*  Earlier this week, Navalny's top aide, Leonid Volkov, who was helping lead that call to
*  action, was beaten and sprayed with tear gas near his home in Vilnius, Lithuania.
*  Just hours before the attack, Volkov had given an interview in which he expressed concern
*  for the safety of Navalny's supporters, saying, quote, The key risk is that we will all be
*  killed.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  A jury in Michigan found James Crumbly guilty of involuntary manslaughter, holding him partially
*  responsible for failing to prevent his son from carrying out the state's deadliest school
*  shooting in 2021.
*  Crumbly's wife was convicted of similar charges in a separate trial last month.
*  The couple's parenting skills had come under intense scrutiny, as had their son's access
*  to a handgun that his father had bought.
*  Now two separate juries have taken the unusual step of holding parents criminally responsible
*  for their child's crimes.
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu during a speech on the Senate floor, calling him a major obstacle to peace in the
*  Middle East and calling for new leadership in Israel.
*  As a lifelong supporter of Israel, it has become clear to me the Netanyahu coalition
*  no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7th.
*  Schumer's speech was the sharpest critique yet from a senior American elected official.
*  He was effectively urging Israelis to replace Netanyahu, who is under indictment in Israel
*  for bribery and fraud.
*  I believe in his heart he has his highest priority is the security of Israel.
*  However, I also believe Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way.
*  Schumer, the highest ranking Jewish elected official in the United States, said that he
*  believed that Netanyahu had chosen himself and his ambition as a politician over his
*  country.
*  Schumer also said that Netanyahu had allowed too many civilian deaths in Gaza, which he
*  argued had reduced support for Israel around the world.
