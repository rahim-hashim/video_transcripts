# What Adidas Knew About Kanye
**New York Times - The Daily:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=4.04s)]
*  Today, when Adidas terminated its multi-billion dollar partnership with Kanye West over his [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=9.56s)]
*  anti-Semitic remarks, it seemed from the outside like a straightforward story of a celebrity [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=19.76s)]
*  suddenly imploding. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=26.86s)]
*  My colleague, investigative reporter Megan Toohey, got inside the partnership and found [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=29.44s)]
*  that the reality was far more complicated. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  It's Friday, November 10th. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=44.08s)]
*  Megan, I want to start with a very simple question. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  Why have you and why have we, the Times, spent all this time investigating Kanye West and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=53.28s)]
*  his relationship with Adidas? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=59.88s)]
*  Well, Michael, if you'll recall, it was almost exactly one year ago that Adidas cut ties [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=62.28s)]
*  with Kanye West as he was in the midst of making anti-Semitic and other public inflammatory [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=68.8s)]
*  comments. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  As he basically melted down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  Because it was like he was having a public implosion and this company said, we're no [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=79.04s)]
*  longer doing business with him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=83.16000000000001s)]
*  We don't tolerate this kind of behavior. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=84.42s)]
*  This goes against our ethics. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=86.68s)]
*  So we're ending this relationship. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=88.36000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  End of story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  To some extent, yes. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  But while the end of this story had played out in public, there was a lot we didn't know [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=94.0s)]
*  about the beginning of the relationship and about the middle of the relationship. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  This collaboration was by and large a total black box for years and years. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=105.14s)]
*  There was a lot that we didn't know about the financial details of the collaboration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=111.1s)]
*  And we also didn't know to what extent the behavior we saw from Kanye West last fall [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=117.42s)]
*  was either kind of an unusual blip or actually part of a pattern of behavior that had played [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=123.02s)]
*  out inside this partnership. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=129.0s)]
*  So as you often do, you're investigating people with a lot of power and a lot of money [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=131.42s)]
*  to see what's really going on inside this relationship. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=136.11999999999998s)]
*  So how do you go about doing this reporting? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  So I traveled to Portland, Oregon, the US headquarters of Adidas and to California where [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=143.14s)]
*  Kanye West has lived and largely operated out of for many years. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  And I ended up interviewing current and former employees of Adidas and of Kanye West, who [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=154.7s)]
*  now goes by Ye, and other people who were in the orbit of this collaboration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=160.66000000000003s)]
*  And I also was able to obtain hundreds of internal records, previously undisclosed documents [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=166.22s)]
*  that included text messages, internal text messages among top Adidas executives as they [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=173.66000000000003s)]
*  were scrambling to respond to this, contracts, company memos, and other financial records. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=178.46s)]
*  Every stone imaginable, it sounds like. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=186.36s)]
*  And what did you find? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=188.22000000000003s)]
*  And where should we start in talking about those findings? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=190.28s)]
*  So my reporting goes all the way back to the very beginning of this partnership in 2013. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=194.42s)]
*  And what's important to know is that Adidas was feeling quite stalled at that time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=201.08s)]
*  It was in the hyper competitive market of sneakers and had fallen way behind Nike. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=206.64s)]
*  Nike had in the 1980s done a deal with Michael Jordan, who is then an up and coming basketball [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=213.56s)]
*  player and had basically blown the competition away ever since. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=219.2s)]
*  So come 2013, Nike has 50 percent of the U.S. athletic shoe market compared to Adidas, which [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=223.1s)]
*  has just eight percent. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=231.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=233.72s)]
*  So a true also ran. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=234.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=235.72s)]
*  And they are desperately looking for ways to start catching up. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=236.72s)]
*  And so enter Kanye West. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=241.16s)]
*  And the Grammy goes to the college dropout, Kanye West. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=243.16s)]
*  Anybody want to know what I would do if I didn't win? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=248.92s)]
*  I guess we'll never know. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  One of the most popular musicians of all time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=256.64s)]
*  For a long time, people were telling me, man, if you go out to New York, you could really [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=261.24s)]
*  kill the game out there. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=265.3s)]
*  He had started his career producing music for other musicians before becoming a complete [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=267.08s)]
*  rap star in his own right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  When someone comes up and says something like, I am a god, everybody says, who does he think [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=274.56s)]
*  he is? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=278.8s)]
*  I just told you who I thought I was. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=279.8s)]
*  A god. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=281.64s)]
*  That's who I think I am. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=282.64s)]
*  That year, he had come out with yet another album, Yeezus, which was topping the charts. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=284.56s)]
*  And beyond that, he had just become this incredible cultural force. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=290.8s)]
*  Kim and Kanye got engaged, everybody. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=295.64s)]
*  He was engaged to Kim Kardashian, who was the star of reality television and soon to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=299.56s)]
*  be of social media. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  They are in the news a lot. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=308.0s)]
*  I think they're in the news more than the news. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=309.56s)]
*  So he was seen as somebody whose power and influence and celebrity stretched beyond the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  music that he made. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  You don't realize I am so frustrated. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=320.35999999999996s)]
*  Like I am so frustrated. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  But for all of his success in music, Kanye wanted more. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=326.76s)]
*  I've got so much I want to give. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=331.76s)]
*  I've got ideas on color palettes. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=333.64s)]
*  I've got ideas on silhouettes. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=336.0s)]
*  He had this burning desire for more creativity, for more power, for more influence. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=338.96s)]
*  At this time, a lot of it was channeled into a burning ambition to break into fashion. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=346.96s)]
*  I eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=353.44s)]
*  But he kept hearing that the best he could hope for was to put his name on other people's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=357.84s)]
*  products. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=363.2s)]
*  So he, in many ways, needs Adidas almost as much as Adidas needs him. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=364.44s)]
*  And so Adidas looks at Kanye and Kanye looks at Adidas and they see an opportunity to serve [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=370.12s)]
*  each other's interests. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=378.02s)]
*  Right, solve each other's problems in that moment. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=379.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=382.32s)]
*  Okay, so what happens? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=387.32s)]
*  So Adidas offers Kanye the most generous contract it has offered a non-athlete ever. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a contract that can stretch into 2017. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=397.12s)]
*  He is going to be a genuine co-creator of both shoes and apparel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=401.12s)]
*  He will collect a 15% royalty on net sales of whatever they make. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  And he will get at least $3 million a year guaranteed. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=412.16s)]
*  A good deal. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=416.0s)]
*  A good deal. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=417.0s)]
*  And no sooner had they signed, Kanye sends a text message to one of the Adidas executives [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=418.08s)]
*  who helped execute the deal saying, the world changes now, with three exclamation points. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=423.76s)]
*  So Adidas is clearly making a very meaningful bet on Kanye. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=430.36s)]
*  Do they have any reservations? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=433.78s)]
*  No. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=436.08s)]
*  One of the things that I learned in talking to people who had worked so closely in this [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=437.84s)]
*  collaboration is that they knew that Kanye was coming into this contract with a history [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=441.16s)]
*  of being dramatic and controversial and provocative. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=448.44s)]
*  I mean, if you'll recall, after Hurricane Katrina, he famously said on TV that President [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=453.24s)]
*  George W. Bush didn't care about black people, which had caused some controversy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  And he was also known for jumping up on stage to protest Taylor Swift winning an MTV award, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=467.04s)]
*  which got a ton of attention. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=473.64000000000004s)]
*  And so Adidas is saying, listen, maybe that provocative streak will actually work in our [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=474.88s)]
*  favor, that it's going to help benefit whatever products we make together. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=484.36s)]
*  Because after all, we're in an era of celebrity where bad news and good news gets kind of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=485.36s)]
*  ambiguous. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=490.6s)]
*  It's all good attention. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=491.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=492.6s)]
*  Attention is attention and can help drive sales. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=493.6s)]
*  Almost as soon as they get into business together, Adidas is glimpsing behavior behind the scenes [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=497.12s)]
*  that could be potentially much more problematic. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=505.04s)]
*  Like what? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=509.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, shortly after signing the contract, Kanye West is hosting Adidas executives and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=510.32s)]
*  other employees at his apartment here in New York. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=516.1s)]
*  And in the middle of the meeting, he forces them to watch pornography, ostensibly to spark [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=520.48s)]
*  creativity. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=526.32s)]
*  It's a very unusual introduction to the company. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=527.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=529.96s)]
*  And I discovered something else startling that happened just a couple of weeks later. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=530.96s)]
*  Kanye was in Germany, the headquarters of Adidas, and they're rolling out the red carpet [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=538.96s)]
*  for him. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=545.24s)]
*  They're so excited about this budding partnership, and they've assembled shoes and a mood board [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=546.24s)]
*  with inspiration and sketches of designs of what the first shoe could potentially look [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=551.48s)]
*  like. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=557.04s)]
*  And none of the designs look like what Kanye had tried to convey that he wanted. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=558.04s)]
*  And to emphasize his frustration, he takes a marker to the toe of a shoe design and he [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=564.0s)]
*  draws a swastika. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=571.6s)]
*  He draws an actual swastika on the shoe. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=573.12s)]
*  He draws an actual swastika on the sketch of this shoe. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=576.12s)]
*  What is the reaction in the room? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, it was shocking, especially for Germans in the group, where it is illegal in many [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  cases to draw or otherwise present swastikas. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=587.92s)]
*  And this is also especially sensitive for this particular company. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=593.02s)]
*  The founder of Adidas, like many other businessmen from his time, belonged to the Nazi party. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=596.76s)]
*  And they were actually just miles from Nuremberg, where, you know, members of the Third Reich [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=601.56s)]
*  were tried for crimes against humanity. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=606.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=609.4s)]
*  So what comes of this really shocking behavior? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=611.0s)]
*  Well, in that case, an American manager who was part of that gathering kind of assured [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=618.1999999999999s)]
*  his German colleagues who were expressing concern that Kanye West didn't understand [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=624.48s)]
*  that what he was doing was illegal and that he was really just voicing his frustration. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=630.4s)]
*  Whether it's the meeting in which the porn was shown or this meeting in which Kanye drew [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=636.68s)]
*  the swastika, there are little glimpses, these kind of red flags that are going up. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=641.12s)]
*  And some people see them and some people don't. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=646.0s)]
*  I think overall, there is an attitude that that's just the price of doing business with [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=648.52s)]
*  a creative genius. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=653.28s)]
*  So in spite of these early red flags, things proceed. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=655.68s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=659.48s)]
*  They just jump into the work together. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=661.04s)]
*  And listen, the Adidas employees learn that Kanye West operates unlike anybody else they've [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=664.4s)]
*  ever worked with. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=670.24s)]
*  He is brimming with ideas and can be enthusiastic to the point of chaos. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=671.76s)]
*  And those people who work with him say he was also so obsessed with detail that it could [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=678.28s)]
*  be hard to get anything done. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=682.8399999999999s)]
*  But eventually, by the beginning of 2015, they have finalized the first Yeezy sneakers. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  Among them, the Yeezy Boost 350. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=692.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's this sleek sneaker that was inspired by Nike's Roshi Run, which was the shoe that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=696.4s)]
*  had come out at the time. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=702.36s)]
*  It was nicknamed actually the Roshi Killer inside Adidas. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=703.96s)]
*  And it had like a flat front, not the standard kind of rolled toe that you see on a lot of [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=707.6s)]
*  running shoes. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  It was covered with this patterned fabric. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=714.16s)]
*  And you know, it wasn't well suited for running or sports, but it went perfectly with the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=717.24s)]
*  kind of athleisure fashion that was coming into style. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=722.88s)]
*  As artists in this world, we can do whatever we want. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=727.4s)]
*  And the plan is to debut this first season of Yeezy at New York Fashion Week. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=732.8399999999999s)]
*  And the moment finally arrives. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=740.6s)]
*  The models come out in all this apparel and these new shoes. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=745.16s)]
*  You know, Kanye is in the front of the group in a very sort of just a black hooded sweatshirt [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  and black pants and on his feet are one of the new pairs of Yeezys. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=756.04s)]
*  And the front row is packed with like a who's who of the most famous in the world. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=764.4s)]
*  Can I just ask what you thought of the show, Kansy? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=771.16s)]
*  I thought it was beautiful. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  Very innovative. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=774.28s)]
*  I love how... [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=775.28s)]
*  There's Beyonce, Jay-Z, there's Rihanna, there's a cluster of Kardashians. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=776.28s)]
*  You guys are no filming other than me. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=780.92s)]
*  It's exactly what Adidas and Kanye had hoped for. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm not even focused on problems. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=788.68s)]
*  That's how I change them. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=790.7199999999999s)]
*  We just focus on beauty, fabric, proportion, and trying to get the price where the kids [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=792.88s)]
*  can get a hold of it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=799.48s)]
*  And then, you know, released in limited runs over the next few months, the shoes sold out [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=802.92s)]
*  in hours, like crashed servers. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=812.52s)]
*  We want to see the shoes. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  Drum roll please. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=817.36s)]
*  They hooked sneakerheads, fashionistas. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=820.68s)]
*  They look good with shorts, they look good with jeans, they look good with those pants, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=822.76s)]
*  And even sports figures who had endorsement deals with rival companies. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=827.24s)]
*  Are buying these. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=833.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was tremendously, tremendously successful. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=834.28s)]
*  So this Kanye West Adidas deal is working out very nicely. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=839.0s)]
*  I'm curious, Megan, did your reporting uncover any other additional troubling behaviors by [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=842.88s)]
*  Kanye West within this collaboration he was having with the company? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=850.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=854.24s)]
*  My reporting found that, in fact, this was a very tumultuous time inside this partnership [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=855.24s)]
*  behind the scenes. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=860.4s)]
*  Kanye West actually in preparing as they were running up against the deadline for the launch [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=861.92s)]
*  of Yeezy Season 1 at New York Fashion Week erupted in anger at the staff and used extremely [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=867.5600000000001s)]
*  sexually explicit offensive language. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=873.92s)]
*  And it was so bad that several members of the team actually complained to higher ups [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=876.92s)]
*  at Adidas about it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=880.94s)]
*  Those type of explosions in anger would prove to be quite common. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=883.24s)]
*  But none of this behavior and not even the complaints slows things down. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=889.08s)]
*  The attention quickly shifts back to the success of these sneakers. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=894.88s)]
*  In fact, each year everybody in the industry gathers for what is known as basically the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  shoe Oscars. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=904.34s)]
*  And that year... [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=906.12s)]
*  We are honored to present him the 2015 Footwear News Shoe of the Year Award for the Adidas [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=907.12s)]
*  Yeezy Boots. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=913.6s)]
*  The 350 won Shoe of the Year, basically the Oscar for Best New Shoe. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=914.6s)]
*  And a beaming Kanye takes to the stage with three Adidas executives behind him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=924.4s)]
*  So it's cool to be up here with the three people that I've screamed at the most in the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=931.72s)]
*  past year. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=938.2s)]
*  And it's actually kind of telling because the first thing that Kanye says is it's nice [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=941.28s)]
*  to be up here with three of the people that I've yelled at the most in the last year. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=946.16s)]
*  But you know, his tone shifting, he later says quite seriously, there was one executive, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=950.92s)]
*  John Wexler, who had helped make the deal happen. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=956.24s)]
*  I have to point out, because then I have to talk about how John basically saved my life. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=959.2800000000001s)]
*  John Wexler... [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=965.5200000000001s)]
*  And Kanye says in what appears to be like a very serious tone, you know, John basically [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=967.5200000000001s)]
*  saved my life. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=973.12s)]
*  They allowed me to be me, they allowed me to express myself, but it's very serious. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=974.9200000000001s)]
*  We're here to make amazing product that we love, that also sells, that makes money. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  So on a personal level, this is very meaningful to Kanye, this person who, as you said earlier, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=989.2s)]
*  had wanted so very much to be taken seriously in the fashion world. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1007.5200000000001s)]
*  And the success is also very meaningful to Adidas. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1009.44s)]
*  I mean, they've been in business now for less than two years, and already the company is [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1012.48s)]
*  thinking, how can we take this deal even farther? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1017.6s)]
*  How can we go all in on Kanye West? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1021.96s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1032.48s)]
*  So what does going all in with Kanye West look like for Adidas? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1041.48s)]
*  So it means we're now in 2016, and even though the first contract is not up for renewal yet, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1045.6s)]
*  they're pouncing on the chance to do a new contract, a new deal. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1054.1999999999998s)]
*  To make it even longer. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1057.1999999999998s)]
*  To make it longer, to set themselves up to make even more money. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1058.24s)]
*  But significantly, this time around, the company wants to insert a mechanism into the deal [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1062.52s)]
*  that's going to allow the company to protect itself. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1068.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1071.76s)]
*  Adidas has seen some very problematic behavior behind the scenes, certainly enough to make [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1072.26s)]
*  them want to protect themselves. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1077.72s)]
*  So what are they discussing exactly? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  How are they envisioning doing that? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1082.8s)]
*  So Adidas is pushing for something known as a morals clause to go into the contract that [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1085.1200000000001s)]
*  would basically outline the situations under which it could terminate the deal with Kanye. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  Basically spelling out certain behaviors, certain lines, that if Kanye crosses them, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1096.88s)]
*  they can have the legal right to say, okay, this deal is over. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1101.1s)]
*  Right, the kind of moral boundaries under which things would end. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1103.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1107.5s)]
*  And talking to people, executives who have worked at big companies that do these kind [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1108.5s)]
*  of deals, they have stressed that they're really important because, yes, the company [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1112.34s)]
*  has to serve its bottom line and enter into deals that are going to be lucrative, but [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1117.4599999999998s)]
*  it also has to protect its reputation. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1121.5s)]
*  And if it's getting into business with somebody who has problematic behavior, especially perspectives [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1123.9399999999998s)]
*  or attitudes that could be easily discoverable, then the company runs the risk of looking [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1130.6599999999999s)]
*  complicit when that all spills into public view. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1136.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1139.78s)]
*  Basically, whether or not it's explicit, endorsing it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1140.78s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1143.94s)]
*  And so after months of negotiations, Adidas and Kanye West finally reach a deal and Kanye [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1145.22s)]
*  actually agrees to the morals clause. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1151.82s)]
*  And it has some pretty specific and strident terms for termination. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1155.08s)]
*  A felony conviction, bankruptcy, 30 consecutive days of mental health or substance abuse treatment, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  or anything that brings disrepute, contempt, scandal to him or tarnishes Adidas. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1167.8s)]
*  Pretty broad language, especially given some of the behavior that Kanye West displays. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1179.6s)]
*  But it's also important to note that while Adidas is getting this moral clause, Kanye [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1180.84s)]
*  West is also getting a lot in this contract as well. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1185.32s)]
*  It's loaded with financial incentives for him. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1189.36s)]
*  During the negotiations, Adidas was predicting that Yeezy sales would grow to $1 billion [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1192.9199999999998s)]
*  a year by 2021. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1197.3999999999999s)]
*  And under this deal, he will continue to get a 15% royalty of net sales. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1200.1999999999998s)]
*  I just want to pause because that is a lot of money. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1204.6799999999998s)]
*  15% of a billion dollars. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1207.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1210.52s)]
*  And on top of that, he will also get $15 million upfront, along with millions of dollars in [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1211.52s)]
*  company stock each year. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1217.76s)]
*  So this is what going all in with Kanye West looks like. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1220.64s)]
*  For Adidas, it means getting a morals clause from their partner. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1224.24s)]
*  For Kanye, it means a boatload of money. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1229.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1233.28s)]
*  I forgot to mention that one of the most significant parts of the contract is that if they met [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1234.96s)]
*  certain financial targets, it could extend for a full decade. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1240.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1245.92s)]
*  And as Kanye said when he signed the new contract in May of 2016, the partnership was now a [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1246.92s)]
*  marriage. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1252.72s)]
*  So once Adidas and Kanye are newlyweds, what happens? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1255.24s)]
*  A lot happens. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1260.32s)]
*  Just a few months after signing that contract, he was on tour for the first time in several [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1265.08s)]
*  years. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1269.6s)]
*  And he was at first wowing audiences with this floating stage. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1270.6s)]
*  But then his shows take this really unexpected turn. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1278.76s)]
*  He's performing a show in Sacramento, and he's a couple songs into his set. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1293.12s)]
*  And he just stops and launches into this 17-minute tirade. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1302.6s)]
*  He's praising President-elect Donald Trump. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1315.28s)]
*  He is blasting the tech and media and music industries. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1323.12s)]
*  He is bad-mouthing Beyonce. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1336.36s)]
*  And insinuating that Jay-Z's going to send killers for him. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1343.6399999999999s)]
*  And then he just drops the mic and walks off stage. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1350.96s)]
*  End of concert. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1358.52s)]
*  End of concert. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1359.8s)]
*  And he actually cancels his remaining shows. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1360.8799999999999s)]
*  And it's clear that something's wrong. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1363.9199999999998s)]
*  And that becomes even more evident the next day. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1366.4199999999998s)]
*  So what I was able to uncover through my reporting is that once he was back in Los Angeles, he [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1371.98s)]
*  was displaying behavior in front of friends and colleagues that was extremely concerning. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1379.36s)]
*  He was writing Bible verses and drawing spaceships on sheets with a Sharpie. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1385.84s)]
*  He appeared consumed with paranoid thoughts, like the belief that government agents were [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1391.28s)]
*  out to get him. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1396.6399999999999s)]
*  And when one of his friends suggested that he take him to a nearby office that the friend [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1398.28s)]
*  Kanye emerged with bags, suitcases packed with pots and pans and Tupperware. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1404.64s)]
*  When they get to the office, his behavior continued to escalate. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1411.2800000000002s)]
*  He was at one point, he threw a bottle through a nearby window. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1414.92s)]
*  And two doctors, including a psychiatrist from UCLA Medical Center, are among those [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1419.46s)]
*  called to the scenes. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1424.0s)]
*  And after observing his behavior, one of the doctors calls 911. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1430.24s)]
*  And this doctor says, I think he's going to need to be hospitalized. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1439.08s)]
*  He's deeply unwell in this moment. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1451.2s)]
*  So it would seem. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1453.82s)]
*  So what happens to Kanye during and after this time in the hospital? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1460.24s)]
*  So after the hospitalization, he goes on medication for bipolar disorder, which is something that [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1466.76s)]
*  he's talked about publicly. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1472.48s)]
*  At times he has called it his superpower. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1474.68s)]
*  Other times he has claimed that he was misdiagnosed and he doesn't have the disorder at all. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1478.36s)]
*  By 2018, he has gone off the medication and he is starting to reenter the public spotlight [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1484.06s)]
*  in ways that many find confusing. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1491.5s)]
*  Including an impromptu interview that he gives to TMZ. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1498.22s)]
*  In which he claims that 400 years of slavery sounds like a choice. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1503.82s)]
*  And that causes a total uproar. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1513.78s)]
*  Megan, candidly, this sounds like an incredibly difficult time for Kanye and for his family. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1516.04s)]
*  But it also seems like exactly the scenario that this morals clause you were telling us [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1522.16s)]
*  Adidas wanted so badly is designed to anticipate and react to. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1529.62s)]
*  So was there any discussion inside of Adidas during this period about invoking that clause? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1534.98s)]
*  Well, we know for sure that they didn't invoke it and it's not clear whether they even considered [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1543.42s)]
*  it, whether they even discussed it. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1549.22s)]
*  Instead... [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1552.0600000000002s)]
*  You mentioned that you attribute a large part of the success to some of your creators. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1553.0600000000002s)]
*  Is anyone more important to you in terms of your creators than Kanye West? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1557.74s)]
*  The CEO of Adidas on a live TV appearance on CNBC. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1564.46s)]
*  That's the slavery comment away. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1569.02s)]
*  Saying that Kanye has helped us have a great comeback in the United States. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1573.26s)]
*  So I always have to ask you about the latest Kanye West drama. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1577.66s)]
*  And he maintains that position months later. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1580.98s)]
*  You know, when you sign up a very, I would say, inspirational and creative person, you [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1583.46s)]
*  don't get mainstream and you got to live with what you got and so far we've had a good relationship [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1587.14s)]
*  with him. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1591.18s)]
*  So the company was very adamant. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1592.74s)]
*  I mean, it stood by Kanye West after the slavery comment. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1594.46s)]
*  And it also stood by him as he displayed a troubling fixation on Jews and Hitler. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1598.82s)]
*  Beyond what he had previously done. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1605.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1606.74s)]
*  I mean, I mentioned earlier this swastika incident at the very beginning of their partnership. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1607.74s)]
*  Since then, he had gone on to tell Adidas collaborators that he believed that Jewish [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1613.3799999999999s)]
*  people had special powers that allowed them to amass money and influence. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1620.22s)]
*  He also had expressed an admiration for Hitler. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1626.7s)]
*  That he saw him as a master marketer. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1631.1000000000001s)]
*  Somebody who had a real gift for propaganda that he admired. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1633.98s)]
*  And you know, at this time, he told Adidas folks that he was considering naming an upcoming [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1637.18s)]
*  album Hitler. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1642.9s)]
*  It was ultimately named Ye. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1643.9s)]
*  And it's around this time that he also tells Adidas executive who is Jewish that he should [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1647.18s)]
*  hang a picture of Hitler in his kitchen and kiss it every morning to practice unconditional [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1653.6999999999998s)]
*  love. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1659.1s)]
*  That's frankly kind of hard to hear. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1660.1s)]
*  It's offensive. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1662.54s)]
*  And you're saying Adidas, this German based company with a huge level of sensitivity to [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1664.06s)]
*  the meaning and the power and the risk of anti-Semitism does nothing about any of this. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1671.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the company, at least what I found in my reporting is that the company does not [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1679.7s)]
*  appear interested in scrutinizing or policing Kanye's behavior. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1684.22s)]
*  Instead, they are scrambling to adjust to it and to somehow accommodate it. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1689.66s)]
*  And how do you adjust and accommodate behavior like this though? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1694.14s)]
*  Well, listen, the Yeezy unit, the team with inside Adidas that worked on the collaboration. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1696.7s)]
*  I mean, a lot of those people were fans of Kanye West, but still it took like a huge [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1700.98s)]
*  emotional toll. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1705.58s)]
*  They adopted a strategy that they like into firefighting, rotating people on and off the [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1707.1s)]
*  front lines to limit exposure to harm. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1712.22s)]
*  The unit was assigned a special human resources official to help manage the drama. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1715.34s)]
*  When you join the team, the company gave you a free subscription to a meditation app to [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1720.6599999999999s)]
*  acknowledge how challenging it could be. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1726.7s)]
*  And so that was what was happening on the group on the front lines. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1729.8999999999999s)]
*  And then behind the scenes, some of the top executives at the company started a group [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1733.76s)]
*  text chain called the Yeezy Hotline in which they scrambled to field Kanye's requests and [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1737.84s)]
*  deal with the kind of constant challenges that arose. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1744.1s)]
*  Adidas is doing whatever it has to do to manage this brewing problem, no matter how much it [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1748.32s)]
*  seems to upset the people on staff, to make sure that this partnership continues. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1755.08s)]
*  By and large, they are very eager to keep this on track and are doing everything possible [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1760.84s)]
*  to make that happen. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1764.8799999999999s)]
*  In fact, at this point, Kanye has moved the Yeezy operation to remote Cody, Wyoming, insisting [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1765.8799999999999s)]
*  that everybody has to follow him there or face termination. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1772.4599999999998s)]
*  So they agree that they're going to help him build up this campus out there. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1776.9199999999998s)]
*  And they're also going to follow through on giving him a hundred million more dollars [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1780.56s)]
*  each year that he can spend with little oversight. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1784.08s)]
*  So the more and more volatile, unpredictable, extremely offensive that Kanye West becomes, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1788.1s)]
*  the more money Adidas is throwing at him and the deeper they seem to enter this marriage. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1796.4599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1804.9399999999998s)]
*  And because of this collaboration, Kanye West ultimately becomes a billionaire. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1806.54s)]
*  He's making so much more money from this than through his music. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1812.7199999999998s)]
*  Good morning, Donda. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1816.22s)]
*  Good morning, Donda. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1818.1000000000001s)]
*  And he launches into more and more wildly ambitious projects. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1820.22s)]
*  I want my kids to go to Donda. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1826.22s)]
*  Donda Academy is a private school he created named after his late mother, Donda West. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1828.8600000000001s)]
*  He starts an unaccredited Christian school, which has since closed and is now under investigation. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1835.1000000000001s)]
*  What is America's destiny? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1842.18s)]
*  What is best for our nation? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1844.14s)]
*  He runs for president in 2020. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1846.72s)]
*  In Liberia, I envision building a city of the future, an infinite city. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1849.76s)]
*  And beyond that, he starts talking about plans to create flying cars and build futuristic [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1856.28s)]
*  communities. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1863.48s)]
*  I mean, he's using language like, I'm going to solve the world's problems one at a time. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1864.48s)]
*  And as he's scaling up these goals and these ambitions, he has this huge financial engine [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1871.78s)]
*  behind him. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1877.54s)]
*  Adidas. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1878.54s)]
*  Adidas. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1879.54s)]
*  So we know where this story ends, because that's where we began. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1880.54s)]
*  This all blows up. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1885.02s)]
*  What does that blow up look like from inside Adidas? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1887.54s)]
*  So let's fast forward to September of last year, September of 2022. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1891.1s)]
*  The Adidas and Kanye West partnership has become strained. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1896.62s)]
*  Kanye's main complaint is that, listen, under the contract, Adidas owned the designs, the [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1902.06s)]
*  shoe designs that they made together. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1907.86s)]
*  But he said that they were misusing and kind of misappropriating those designs. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1909.98s)]
*  And he was crying theft at that point. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1914.22s)]
*  Over the weekend, Yi posted on his Instagram account, taking aim at Adidas board members. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1916.5s)]
*  He goes on social media and takes shots at the CEO and members of the supervisory board. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1922.16s)]
*  Last night, Swiss Beats Instagram. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1928.88s)]
*  He gets high profile friends like Diddy and Swiss Beats to threaten to boycott the company. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1931.72s)]
*  And it reaches this pretty remarkable moment when he actually shows up to the Adidas office [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1939.6000000000001s)]
*  in Los Angeles with a videographer in tow. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1945.8200000000002s)]
*  He's meeting with some of the top Adidas executives at that time. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1949.3999999999999s)]
*  And he is making his demands and he's actually ambushes them with pornography. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1953.68s)]
*  Again. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1959.52s)]
*  Again. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1960.52s)]
*  He's showing this porn film about a woman wronged by her cheating boyfriend to emphasize [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1961.52s)]
*  his feelings of betrayal in the relationship. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1968.16s)]
*  And in the same meeting, he's making other complaints and issuing threats. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1971.3999999999999s)]
*  At one point, he says, our army is so prepared. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1976.68s)]
*  This is a different level of nuclear activity that no one will recover from. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1980.48s)]
*  Oi. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1985.44s)]
*  And listen, that's what he was doing in these communications and his relationship with Adidas. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1991.44s)]
*  What happens in the next weeks is his other public behavior escalates as well, beyond Adidas. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=1996.96s)]
*  So within weeks, he has shown up to New York Fashion Week and worn, along with the conservative [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2003.4799999999998s)]
*  commentator Candice Owens, these White Lives Matter t-shirts. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2010.6799999999998s)]
*  And when that sparks a backlash, he kind of goes on the offensive and basically starts [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2015.6399999999999s)]
*  in interviews and on social media, making anti-Semitic comments, calling Black Lives [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2022.04s)]
*  Matter a scam. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2026.9599999999998s)]
*  He ends up going on the Drink Champs podcast and doubling down on everything he's said [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2029.0s)]
*  and even going one step further. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2034.88s)]
*  The thing about it, me and Adidas, it's like, I could literally say anti-Semitic shit and [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2036.8400000000001s)]
*  they can't drop me. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2042.0s)]
*  He says in this interview, I can say anti-Semitic stuff and Adidas can't drop me. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2043.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2048.52s)]
*  I could say anti-Semitic things and Adidas can't drop me. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2049.52s)]
*  Now what? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2054.16s)]
*  He's basically saying in this marriage, I hold so many of the cards that I can make [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2055.64s)]
*  Adidas stay with me. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2061.16s)]
*  I can kind of make them complicit. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2062.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2064.2s)]
*  And of course, in the moment, that sounds like shocking to listeners of that interview. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2065.2s)]
*  But now having reported behind the scenes, you can get a sense of how he could actually [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2069.7599999999998s)]
*  say that. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2074.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2075.72s)]
*  And why it might be true. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2076.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2077.72s)]
*  At least from his perspective and his experience over those many years of the partnership. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2078.72s)]
*  But at this point, he is coming under even more broad and intense attack and criticism. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2082.44s)]
*  Politicians, Jewish leaders, fellow entertainers, people like leaders in Hollywood are denouncing [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2088.76s)]
*  his behavior and saying that it's dangerous and is going to inspire others to embrace [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2095.6800000000003s)]
*  bigotry and are really exerting pressure on Adidas to cut ties. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2100.1400000000003s)]
*  And so just days after that Drink Champs interview in which he was basically taunting Adidas [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2105.84s)]
*  to try to cut ties with him, the company does just that. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2110.7s)]
*  They tell Kanye that he has violated the terms of their contract and that they have the legal [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2115.5s)]
*  right to now end it. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2121.2s)]
*  Well, given just how important this partnership has been to both sides, it's floating Kanye. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2122.7799999999997s)]
*  It's the bulk of his money, you've told us. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2130.64s)]
*  And for Adidas, it's been their revival. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2132.8399999999997s)]
*  What happens once this deal is off? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2136.2599999999998s)]
*  So Adidas immediately stop selling EZs and both parties take a huge hit. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2139.02s)]
*  The company projected its first annual loss in decades and Kanye West's net worth plummets. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2146.54s)]
*  And so the cost of this overreliance, this mutual dependence that had become so great [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2156.02s)]
*  in this moment is very clearly laid bare. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2161.2599999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2164.02s)]
*  And it's not over. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2165.06s)]
*  How is it not over? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2166.66s)]
*  It's not supposed to be. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2167.66s)]
*  Adidas says over. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2168.66s)]
*  So even as they're publicly attacking each other, Kanye West and Adidas continue to have [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2170.66s)]
*  a shared interest. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2176.0s)]
*  And that is in the $1.3 billion of EZ inventory that are in warehouses around the world. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2177.92s)]
*  And that had been basically just shelved after the agreement came to an end. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2186.7s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2191.3799999999997s)]
*  By May of last year, Adidas now has a new CEO. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2192.58s)]
*  And he comes out and announces that they're going to actually release all of that inventory [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2196.38s)]
*  for sale. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2201.58s)]
*  Huh. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2202.86s)]
*  Even as they're divorcing, they're still relying on each other. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2204.26s)]
*  Yeah, they're not missing an opportunity to make at least one more round of serious money. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2207.82s)]
*  And the cut of those sales would go to the Anti-Defamation League and a group founded [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2216.78s)]
*  by George Floyd's family. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2222.0s)]
*  But most of the money is going to Adidas. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2224.2s)]
*  And under the contract, Kanye West is still entitled to royalties of those sales. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2226.74s)]
*  And so the shoes ended up taking in about $437 million in sales through June, just these [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2232.08s)]
*  first waves. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2237.88s)]
*  And they're not done with those sales. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2238.88s)]
*  And so with this influx of EZ money, the company has been able to improve its financial forecast [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2241.04s)]
*  for the year. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2248.92s)]
*  And Kanye West has reappeared. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2250.5s)]
*  He performed on stage for the first time over the summer. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2253.76s)]
*  And music, from what is rumored to be a comeback album, has leaked online. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2257.86s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2263.54s)]
*  So in the end, despite everything he did, he's still profiting from this partnership. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2265.0s)]
*  And so as Adidas, even as it can go out in the world and say, we canceled this deal. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2270.74s)]
*  We're done with it. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2276.04s)]
*  We're not affiliated with him anymore. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2277.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2278.54s)]
*  What we were also able to see was that consumers, by and large, were not deterred by what happened [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2279.58s)]
*  last fall. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2285.22s)]
*  And the way that these shoes started to sell out again so quickly also showed that many [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2286.74s)]
*  people just didn't care about Kanye West's behavior. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2292.1s)]
*  And there even starts to be some speculation that Adidas and Kanye West may actually go [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2296.14s)]
*  into another deal again. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2301.94s)]
*  But when I reached out to Adidas to present what I had found through my reporting as we [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2304.5s)]
*  prepared to publish our story, they provided me with a statement saying that Adidas has [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2309.48s)]
*  no tolerance for hate speech and offensive behavior, which is why the company terminated [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2316.76s)]
*  the Adidas Yeezy partnership. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2321.76s)]
*  The company turned down interview requests and citing confidentiality rules, declined [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  to comment on financial aspects of the collaboration and its relationship with Kanye West. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2329.98s)]
*  And Kanye West declined interview requests and did not respond to written questions [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2335.5s)]
*  or provide comments. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2340.52s)]
*  Megan, zooming way out for a second, there seem to be two ways to think about the story [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2342.28s)]
*  you have just told us. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2346.8s)]
*  On one level, the story you found here about Adidas and Kanye is really the story, it seems, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2348.24s)]
*  of a company doing whatever it had to do to appease a troubled partner. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2353.96s)]
*  Instead of holding Kanye accountable for his behaviors, Adidas just kept throwing more [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2359.06s)]
*  and more money at him, even as the things he was saying were getting more and more offensive. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2363.8s)]
*  And the company did not seem all that interested in blunting the impact on the people that [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2370.26s)]
*  Kanye was offending, either inside or outside of the company. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2377.1400000000003s)]
*  But on another level, it seems to be the story of a company getting exactly what it bargained [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2381.1600000000003s)]
*  for. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2387.42s)]
*  Right? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2388.42s)]
*  A provocative celebrity, this mad genius who was going to garner a ton of attention. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2389.42s)]
*  Some good, some bad. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2393.7s)]
*  That was going to turn into profit. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2395.12s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2396.96s)]
*  Adidas got the attention, it got the profit. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2397.96s)]
*  So what are we supposed to make of all that? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2401.08s)]
*  Well, I think that you're right that this really is a classic tale of a company that [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2402.7599999999998s)]
*  made this fraught bargain in pursuit of celebrity and profit. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2408.48s)]
*  And Adidas tapped into that and capitalized on that. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2413.16s)]
*  This Yeezy collaboration made more money and became more culturally influential than, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2417.24s)]
*  I think, either party, certainly Adidas, imagined when they first started the relationship. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2423.3199999999997s)]
*  And I remember talking to a source who had worked at Adidas and had been closely involved [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2430.0s)]
*  in the collaboration who described it like a company becoming hooked on a bad drug. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2434.8399999999997s)]
*  And they just got deeper and deeper and more and more hooked and didn't know how to break [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2441.54s)]
*  away. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2445.74s)]
*  And so by the time this relationship came to an end, by the time Adidas was backed into [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2446.82s)]
*  a corner and had to end it, you were able to see how completely dependent they had become. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2450.98s)]
*  On that drug that was Kanye West. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2457.7000000000003s)]
*  On that drug that was Kanye West. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2459.4s)]
*  And by that point, it was too late. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2461.46s)]
*  They had become overly dependent on him. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2463.7000000000003s)]
*  So they're now scrambling to recover. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2466.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's not clear to what extent they'll be able to recover. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2470.86s)]
*  There's only one Kanye West. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2475.48s)]
*  And you can't really replicate what the collaboration with him brought to Adidas. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2478.4s)]
*  But you also can't really calculate the damage that the collaboration did to Adidas in the process. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2484.92s)]
*  Well, Megan, thank you very much. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2495.64s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2498.16s)]
*  On Wednesday, a few days after the publication of Megan's investigation, the CEO of Adidas, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2499.32s)]
*  Bjorn Goulden, raised the possibility that the company may never release the remaining [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2511.52s)]
*  stock of unsold Yeezy shoes, a decision that he said could cost Adidas about $320 million. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2517.7200000000003s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2528.44s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2546.6s)]
*  On Thursday, under intense pressure from the U.S., Israel agreed to establish daily four-hour [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2549.04s)]
*  pauses in its assault on Hamas in selected areas of northern Gaza in order to allow civilians [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2556.2799999999997s)]
*  there to flee the fighting. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2563.64s)]
*  But Israel emphasized that the pauses were not the same as a ceasefire and that they [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2566.12s)]
*  would have no influence on its broader operation to destroy Hamas in response to the group's [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2572.24s)]
*  October 7th attack on Israeli civilians. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2579.24s)]
*  And... [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2583.16s)]
*  I believe in my heart of hearts that I have accomplished what I set out to do for West [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2584.16s)]
*  Virginia. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2588.7599999999998s)]
*  I have made one of the toughest decisions of my life and decided that I will not be [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2589.7599999999998s)]
*  running for reelection to the United States Senate. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2593.56s)]

*  liberal wing, said he would not seek reelection in 2024 in a major blow to his party's hope [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2602.48s)]
*  of keeping control of the Senate next year. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2610.44s)]
*  Democrats currently control just 51 votes in the Senate, and without Manchin on the [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XvASeRuXQ&t=2614.7200000000003s)]
