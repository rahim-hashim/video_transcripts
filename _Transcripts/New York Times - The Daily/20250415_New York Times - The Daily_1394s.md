# Trapped Abroad: The Man at the Center of a Constitutional Standoff
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=0.0s)]
*  At the White House on Monday, President Trump met with El Salvador's President, Naïve [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=11.36s)]
*  Bukele, with the fate of one man hanging in the balance. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=15.72s)]
*  Today, my colleague Adam Liptaek, on the Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to a notoriously [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=19.88s)]
*  brutal prison in El Salvador, and what is case, which tests the limit of presidential [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=25.68s)]
*  power, means for the rule of law. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=30.56s)]
*  It's Tuesday, April 15th. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=37.0s)]
*  So Adam, we have talked a lot on this show about the Trump administration's efforts [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=44.44s)]
*  to crack down on immigration and deport people really quickly. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=48.84s)]
*  We've talked about the Venezuelan migrants, students at Columbia and other schools, but [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=53.24s)]
*  today we want to zero in on one case in particular, this man from Maryland. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=58.08s)]
*  Can you start by telling us who is he and how did he end up where he is? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=63.22s)]
*  So his name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=68.3s)]
*  He was born in El Salvador in 1995. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=71.92s)]
*  He moved to the United States when he was 16 years old after a gang in El Salvador threatened [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=76.58s)]
*  him in trying to extort money from his family's business. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=84.33999999999999s)]
*  He arrives here in 2011, enters without authorization, finds work, goes about his business, and is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=89.14s)]
*  arrested in 2019 on immigration offenses. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  He has then and now never had a criminal record in El Salvador or the United States. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=101.58s)]
*  And goes before an immigration judge, and the judge, and this is important, issues a [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=110.98s)]
*  ruling that says he faces dire consequences if he were to be sent back to El Salvador. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=116.92s)]
*  And the judge issues a ruling that says you may not deport him to El Salvador. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=126.72s)]
*  And he goes on living in the United States as a work permit, checks in with the immigration [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=133.88s)]
*  authorities every year, gets married, is raising three kids, and a few weeks ago he is detained [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=140.76s)]
*  again. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=149.72s)]
*  And this time he gets no process. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=151.28s)]
*  He is sent to Louisiana, a detention facility, and then is put on an airplane to El Salvador, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=153.9s)]
*  the one place he cannot be deported to under the immigration law. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=163.94s)]
*  And moreover, he's sent to El Salvador to a notoriously inhumane, squalid, and dangerous [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=170.02s)]
*  prison there called the Center for Terrorism Confinement. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=179.9s)]
*  And there he sits. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=184.82000000000002s)]
*  And his lawyers go to court in Maryland, and the lawyer says there's been a terrible injustice [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=189.62s)]
*  here, we've got to get him back. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=196.02s)]
*  And the government's initial response is, that's right, there's been an administrative [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=197.86s)]
*  error here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=203.34s)]
*  This shouldn't have happened. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=204.34s)]
*  He shouldn't be in El Salvador. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  The lawyers initially say, we're looking into it, we're trying to figure out how to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=209.1s)]
*  fix it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=212.38s)]
*  The lawyer says he's not getting cooperation from his superiors. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=214.1s)]
*  At the government. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=218.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=219.34s)]
*  But everybody agrees this shouldn't have happened. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=220.34s)]
*  And you might think the answer is to take steps to bring him back. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=224.98s)]
*  But then the administration, as this goes up the food chain in the Trump administration, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=229.92s)]
*  steps to dig in his heels. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=235.3s)]
*  And here's a bad sign for Mr. Abrego Garcia. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=237.5s)]
*  The government lawyer who made those concessions is put on administrative leave because, Pam [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  Bondi, the U.S. Attorney General says, the lawyer had not zealously represented the position [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=247.9s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=255.38000000000002s)]
*  Just because they admitted a mistake? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=257.12s)]
*  Because the lawyer did the ordinary thing expected of an American attorney in an American [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=260.74s)]
*  courtroom, which is to be candid with the court. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=266.38s)]
*  Zealous advocacy is one thing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=272.26s)]
*  But you also have an obligation as an officer of the court to tell the truth. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=274.44s)]
*  So what does the Maryland judge say about all of this? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=279.3s)]
*  She couldn't be more appalled. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=283.26s)]
*  She says this shocks the conscience that this kind of lawless behavior is un-American. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=285.74s)]
*  And she orders the government to facilitate and effectuate, and those words may become [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=294.98s)]
*  important as we talk about this, his return in very short order. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=302.02s)]
*  She tells the government to bring him home. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  And can we just pause here for a second before we get to the facilitate and effectuate language? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=309.76s)]
*  Why does the judge say that this shocks the conscience? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=314.6s)]
*  What exactly is she finding so egregious about all of this? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  A couple things. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=321.68s)]
*  One, that this was in plain violation of a court order. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=323.48s)]
*  Two, that he wasn't afforded the merest amount of due process. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=328.44s)]
*  And if he had been afforded that, he could have made two points. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=336.88s)]
*  that he's exempt from being deported to El Salvador. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=341.72s)]
*  And two, that if there are other things to be said about his life, he could dispute that, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=346.48s)]
*  put in evidence, call witnesses. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=352.54s)]
*  He was afforded neither of those things. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=355.98s)]
*  And so how does the government respond to all of this? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=359.42s)]
*  What is the case that they're making exactly about why they deported this man? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=362.0s)]
*  So as the case moves up through the legal system, the government never backs off its [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=367.28s)]
*  concession that this was an oversight a mistake. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=372.0s)]
*  But they now say that they're not capable of fixing the mistake because Mr. Obregol [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=376.73999999999995s)]
*  Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador and the United States is powerless to retrieve [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=383.64s)]
*  him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=392.26s)]
*  The government starts to lean on a theory that Obregol Garcia is a member of an El Salvador [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=393.6s)]
*  gang, MS-13. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=400.56s)]
*  They have very little evidence for this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=403.64s)]
*  A confidential informant, we don't know who this is, accused Obregol Garcia of being affiliated [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=406.84s)]
*  with an Upstate New York branch of the gang. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=414.32s)]
*  He says he's never been to Upstate New York. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=417.64s)]
*  And in any event, even if everything was true, even if he's a member of this gang, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=420.92s)]
*  even if that's criminal conduct, even if it's criminal conduct in the United States, that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=427.36s)]
*  still doesn't give the government the right to deport him. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=431.76s)]
*  Maybe it gives them the right to prosecute him in the United States. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=435.72s)]
*  Maybe it gives them the right to send him somewhere other than El Salvador. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  But the one thing we know is that it's unlawful to send him to El Salvador. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=444.04s)]
*  And their legal argument basically consists of, it's a pity it happened, shouldn't have [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  happened, but now that he's in El Salvador, we have no way of getting him back. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=457.36s)]
*  So then what happens next? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=462.1s)]
*  It goes to a federal appeals court. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=464.0s)]
*  All three judges on the federal appeals court say the government needs to take steps to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=466.6s)]
*  get him back. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  It then goes to the US Supreme Court. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=473.47999999999996s)]
*  And in what is basically a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court affirms most of what the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=476.64s)]
*  trial judge said. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=485.0s)]
*  Remember, the judge used two verbs, facilitate and effectuate. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  And the court, in an unsigned decision, bears down on those two words and endorses facilitate. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=494.12s)]
*  You gotta get to work, people. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=501.52s)]
*  You have to take steps. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=504.2s)]
*  Clearly, something has gone wrong here. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=505.96s)]
*  And the court says, take steps to fix it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=508.94s)]
*  But the court stops short of endorsing effectuate. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=511.84s)]
*  It says it's not quite clear what the judge meant by that, and that it's possible that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=515.8s)]
*  it goes too far. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=520.64s)]
*  The court doesn't like to, doesn't want to tell the president how to conduct foreign [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=522.88s)]
*  affairs, how to supervise the immigration system. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=527.72s)]
*  And in practical terms, what does this mean for the government's obligation, this distinction [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=531.32s)]
*  between effectuate and facilitate? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=535.6s)]
*  I think what it means is that the court is not ordering an outcome, it's ordering process. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=538.7600000000001s)]
*  But the thrust of the court's decision is, let's be serious. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=548.12s)]
*  You gotta get him back. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=552.74s)]
*  So basically, it's the difference between a should and a must. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=554.1600000000001s)]
*  The court is basically saying, do everything you can, but if you ultimately can't bring [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=556.6400000000001s)]
*  fulfilled your obligation. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=560.68s)]
*  That puts it very well, that's right. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=562.8599999999999s)]
*  It also feels like the ruling gives the administration some leeway, right? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=564.8399999999999s)]
*  Because the ruling is basically telling the government, please try. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=569.0799999999999s)]
*  So if the government, for example, says, well, look, we called up the president of El Salvador [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=572.04s)]
*  and we asked him nicely and he said no, we did our job. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=576.5999999999999s)]
*  That's the end of it, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=580.56s)]
*  So there are things the United States could do. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=582.1999999999999s)]
*  You could extradite Abrego Garcia. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=585.4799999999999s)]
*  If the U.S. contends he's a criminal, start extradition proceedings and have him returned [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=588.8s)]
*  here. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  Recall also that we are paying the government of El Salvador $6 million to house these people [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=595.0799999999999s)]
*  we've deported there. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=603.3s)]
*  You would think that alone would give us the power to say, you know what, we're not paying [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=605.06s)]
*  for this guy, send him back. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=609.68s)]
*  The United States is a very powerful country and if it wants to achieve something as simple [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=612.24s)]
*  as having an ally to accomplish something, it just beggars belief that it couldn't be [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=621.54s)]
*  achieved. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=627.92s)]
*  So if we are in a scenario where facilitate is the order of the day, that essentially [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=628.92s)]
*  still means that the government should be trying all avenues to get this guy home. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=634.72s)]
*  That's what the Supreme Court said and meant. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=641.16s)]
*  That's what lower courts have said and meant. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=645.9399999999999s)]
*  They probably on some level didn't think that it would take more than that. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=650.06s)]
*  You're right, Rachel, in suggesting this is kind of a judicial nudge. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=656.92s)]
*  It's not an order. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=662.8s)]
*  This is difficult. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=664.1999999999999s)]
*  The court acknowledges that it owes the president some deference in his conduct of foreign affairs. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=665.76s)]
*  But still, I think the courts, and uniformly so, hoped and believed that it wouldn't take [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=677.64s)]
*  very much to persuade the government of the United States to do something when it concedes [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=685.62s)]
*  that a terrible injustice has been done. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=692.64s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=703.72s)]
*  So Adam, this judicial nudge, as you put it, even if it's not a demand on the administration, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=714.4s)]
*  it seems like it would be a win for Abrego Garcia, because as you say, there's a lot [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=720.64s)]
*  of levers that the administration could pull here to try to get this man back, but he's [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=725.76s)]
*  obviously still not home. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=730.4399999999999s)]
*  So what happened after the Supreme Court issued its decision in this case? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=731.6999999999999s)]
*  Abrego Garcia's lawyer issued a statement after the Supreme Court ruled that said the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=736.28s)]
*  rule of law has prevailed. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=741.24s)]
*  Bring him home. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=742.92s)]
*  And there was a sense, at least initially, that the administration would say, okay, we hear the nudge. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=745.6s)]
*  We'll take steps and we'll bring him home. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=753.9200000000001s)]
*  But almost immediately, it became clear that the administration had no particular interest [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=757.08s)]
*  in doing that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=765.0600000000001s)]
*  So tell us about that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=766.84s)]
*  What does the administration do right after the ruling? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=767.84s)]
*  So the court rules on Thursday evening, and Friday morning, the trial judge says, I want [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=772.1999999999999s)]
*  answers, I want a status report, I want to know what you're doing, what steps you're [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=781.24s)]
*  taking to bring Abrego Garcia home. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=787.16s)]
*  That also echoes language in the Supreme Court's order. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=791.5799999999999s)]
*  And the administration on Friday morning says, you know what, we need more time. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=797.18s)]
*  We're not ready to come talk to you. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=804.18s)]
*  Why don't you set this down, not for Friday, not over the weekend, not for Monday, but [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=806.22s)]
*  for Tuesday? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=812.42s)]
*  And the judge is flabbergasted by that idea. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=814.46s)]
*  After all, Abrego Garcia has been wrongly confined in El Salvador for a month by then. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=820.46s)]
*  And she says, no, I want answers right now. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=826.82s)]
*  And I want daily reports on what's happening here, what you're doing to get him back. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=829.82s)]
*  And those daily reports start to come in. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=835.58s)]
*  And they are very thin. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=838.58s)]
*  They don't indicate that the administration is doing anything. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=841.24s)]
*  The administration, almost grudgingly, says, well, he's alive. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=845.0400000000001s)]
*  And he's being held at this terrorism prison and essentially says nothing more other than [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=851.74s)]
*  that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=860.02s)]
*  We are powerless to get him back. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=861.02s)]
*  He's in the hands of another nation's sovereign authorities. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=863.14s)]
*  And the judge's attempts to get this thing rolling are stymied. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=869.74s)]
*  It sounds like they're not really doing anything to heed any of the requests or demands that [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=876.18s)]
*  they do something to bring this man home. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  The government gets more and more hostile, more and more dug in, until on Sunday, they, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=884.78s)]
*  in essence, tell the judge that she's powerless to do anything. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=893.42s)]
*  So basically, we're back where we started, right? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=897.14s)]
*  The government is returning to this argument that you, the courts, can't tell us what to [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=902.42s)]
*  do when it comes to foreign policy. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=906.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=908.38s)]
*  And also, that we don't want to get him back. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=909.38s)]
*  Mr. President, it's an honor to have you. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=914.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=916.78s)]
*  You're doing incredibly for your country. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=917.78s)]
*  So this was brought into vivid relief on Monday, when El Salvador's president, President Naim [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=920.9799999999999s)]
*  Bukele, pays a visit to Donald Trump in the Oval Office and is asked... [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=927.14s)]
*  Can President Bukele weigh in on this? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=934.18s)]
*  Do you plan to return him? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=935.6999999999999s)]
*  Are you going to send Abengo Garcia back? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=937.3s)]
*  How can I return him to the United States? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=939.58s)]
*  It's like I smuggle him into the United States or whatever you do. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=941.38s)]
*  Of course, I'm not going to do it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=944.46s)]
*  And he treats that as a kind of laughable question. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=945.78s)]
*  The question is preposterous. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=948.34s)]
*  How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=949.34s)]
*  I don't have the power to return him to the United States. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=952.54s)]
*  He says, what am I going to do? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=956.2199999999999s)]
*  Send a terrorist into the United States? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=958.42s)]
*  So you could tell that the two presidents, Trump and Bukele, were on the same page and [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=961.3399999999999s)]
*  had no interest in returning Abengo Garcia to Maryland. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=969.0999999999999s)]
*  Would you answer that question also, please? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=974.8599999999999s)]
*  Yes, gladly. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=977.14s)]
*  So as Pam mentioned... [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=978.14s)]
*  The president's chief immigration advisor, Stephen Miller, pipes up... [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=979.74s)]
*  Yes, there's a 9-0... [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=985.7s)]
*  In our favor. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=987.82s)]
*  In our favor, against the district court ruling, saying that no district court has the power [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=988.82s)]
*  to compel the foreign policy function of the United States. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=993.0600000000001s)]
*  As Pam said... [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=995.86s)]
*  And proposes an interpretation of the Supreme Court decision in the Abengo Garcia case, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=997.0600000000001s)]
*  which is that it was a 9-0 win for the administration because of its reference to the president's [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1005.9000000000001s)]
*  power to conduct foreign affairs. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1013.34s)]
*  And so focusing on a phrase in the decision, Stephen Miller completely flips what is the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1015.82s)]
*  great bulk and thrust of the court's opinion. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1025.9s)]
*  So basically they're spinning this as a victory. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1029.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1031.94s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1032.94s)]
*  Thank you, Pat. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1033.94s)]
*  Thank you, Brad. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1035.54s)]
*  He said it on the floor. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1036.54s)]
*  Thank you, Grandma. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1037.54s)]
*  They say that the Supreme Court has essentially said not, we're nudging you, you should bring [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1038.54s)]
*  him home, but rather you decide. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1047.1000000000001s)]
*  You get to decide in the area of foreign affairs and immigration who gets deported, who doesn't, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1050.9s)]
*  whom you bring back, whom you don't. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1057.8600000000001s)]
*  So the two sides manage to read the same judicial decision quite differently. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1061.22s)]
*  So Adam, we have had you on the show before talking about whether the various showdowns [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1067.3400000000001s)]
*  between the administration and courts are leading toward a constitutional crisis. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1072.22s)]
*  And it feels like a distinction that has been made before is that there's a difference between [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1077.44s)]
*  the administration making a legal argument, no matter how bad legal scholars say it is, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1082.42s)]
*  and the administration openly flouting a court and saying, we're not going to listen [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1087.34s)]
*  to you. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1091.1999999999998s)]
*  And I just sort of wonder like where this case sits within that distinction. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1092.1999999999998s)]
*  So that's a very good question, Rachel. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1097.86s)]
*  And we used to think that there are two things that could go on. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1099.72s)]
*  There's the administration making weak, not very persuasive arguments, but still kind [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1104.4599999999998s)]
*  of doing law. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1113.1s)]
*  And then at the other end of the spectrum, the administration being told to do something [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1114.98s)]
*  and refusing to do it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1119.26s)]
*  And that's defiance. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1121.26s)]
*  And that's the classic constitutional crisis. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1122.6399999999999s)]
*  So here we have something I didn't anticipate, a third thing, where everybody acknowledges [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1125.62s)]
*  that the initial deportation in the Abril Garcia case was unlawful. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1133.62s)]
*  And yet the administration continues to make kind of legalistic arguments defending it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1140.7s)]
*  And this third thing may be the constitutional crisis everyone's been waiting for. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1147.72s)]
*  It doesn't take the classic form, but it gets you to pretty much the same place. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1154.2s)]
*  Adam, I think that probably there are a lot of people out there that might say something [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1158.98s)]
*  along the lines of this man was in the country illegally. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1164.28s)]
*  There's a reason to think that he's a gang member. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1167.6s)]
*  You know, trust the president. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddlb-kZLlJE&t=1170.52s)]
