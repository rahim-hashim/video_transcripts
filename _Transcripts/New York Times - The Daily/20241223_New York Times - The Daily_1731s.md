Video Description: How President Biden could transform women’s rights and rescue his legacy with just a ring.


Dozens of congressional Democrats have a simple pitch to President Biden: with a single phone call he can revolutionize women’s rights and salvage his damaged legacy. 


Annie Karni, a congressional correspondent at The New York Times, discusses whether that plan is possible and, if so, whether Mr. Biden would try. 


Guest: Annie Karni (https://www.nytimes.com/by/annie-karni) , a congressional correspondent at The New York Times.

# Could One Phone Call Lead to the 28th Amendment?
**New York Times - The Daily:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=4.38s)]
*  Today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=10.8s)]
*  The pitch to President Biden from dozens of congressional Democrats is simple. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  With a single phone call, they've told him, he can revolutionize women's rights and revive [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=18.38s)]
*  his damaged legacy in the process. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=24.88s)]
*  The question now is whether they're right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=28.34s)]
*  And even if they are, whether Biden is willing to do it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  It's Monday, December 23rd. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=41.82s)]
*  Hello Annie Carney. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  Hello Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  You are actually joining us from inside Congress where there has been lots of news over the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=55.18s)]
*  past few days and we are grateful for you making time for us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=59.78s)]
*  I'm happy to be here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=63.82s)]
*  I'm sitting on the House side in a small recording booth. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=64.94s)]
*  Yeah, it looks very cozy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=68.26s)]
*  This story begins with a quest to do something that from today's perspective, a lot of people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=70.74s)]
*  might think is already baked into American law, but it's not. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=77.5s)]
*  The whole story of why it's actually not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=82.78s)]
*  So this is a story that starts about a century ago and it's a pretty remarkable story about [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=85.62s)]
*  a very simple idea. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=91.9s)]
*  And that is that men and women should be equal under the law in the United States and that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=93.9s)]
*  discrimination based on sex should be prohibited. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=99.26s)]
*  That's the whole thing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=103.54s)]
*  But it's never actually been put into the Constitution in such plain language. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=105.06s)]
*  Right, that men and women must be treated equal under the eyes of law. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=109.86s)]
*  That's actually not language in the US Constitution. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=113.25999999999999s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=116.33999999999999s)]
*  You have the 14th Amendment, which has an equal protection clause, but that doesn't [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=117.33999999999999s)]
*  mention sex specifically. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  And this passed in the 1860s, decades before women were even guaranteed the right to vote. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=123.78s)]
*  This existed when married women in many states couldn't even own property under their own [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=130.1s)]
*  names. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  So this was not really about sex equality. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  Right, it will eventually apply to sex equality cases, the 14th Amendment, but it doesn't, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=138.06s)]
*  as you say, specifically mention sex. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=142.78s)]
*  Correct. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=145.1s)]
*  So in 1923, a suffragist named Alice Paul comes up with the idea that the United States [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=146.1s)]
*  needs a constitutional amendment specifically addressing women's equality. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=152.42s)]
*  And she actually gets something in front of lawmakers, but it doesn't really go anywhere [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=157.26s)]
*  or get any traction for years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=161.86s)]
*  Welcome to the kind of woman power that sustained our grandmothers for 72 years in their struggle [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=167.94s)]
*  to get the right to vote. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=173.74s)]
*  Until the late 1960s, when the women's rights movement is really blossoming. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=175.3s)]
*  Welcome to the new wave of feminism. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=179.9s)]
*  Welcome to each other. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=182.34s)]
*  Welcome home. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=183.98s)]
*  And suddenly, there is excitement around this idea. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=184.98s)]
*  And what happens once the women's rights movement is in blossom? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=191.3s)]
*  I would like to discuss with you briefly the Equal Rights Amendment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=194.58s)]
*  So in 1971, a Democratic lawmaker in the House introduces a bill called the Equal Rights Amendment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=198.78s)]
*  The Equal Rights Amendment gives women rights that they do not now have. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=205.46s)]
*  And it passes with overwhelming margins from both parties. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=212.86s)]
*  And then a year later, it passes the Senate where the final vote was 84 to 8 in favor [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=217.74s)]
*  of the Equal Rights Amendment. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=224.1s)]
*  Tonight, after a 49 year struggle, a constitutional amendment appears on the way proclaiming once [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=225.34s)]
*  and for all that women have all the same rights as that other sex. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=231.58s)]
*  But there's one more step that needs to happen for an amendment to become part of the Constitution. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=236.34s)]
*  And that is it needs three quarters of the states to adopt it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=243.02s)]
*  For today, Indiana became the 35th, leaving the women's rights declaration just three [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=247.86s)]
*  states away from becoming the 27th Amendment to the Constitution. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=252.62s)]
*  And 35 states pass it in just five years, leaving it just three states short of ratification. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=256.38s)]
*  So it looks like it's just sailing smoothly through the process of becoming a constitutional amendment. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=263.42s)]
*  I get fed up with the women's liberationists running down motherhood and saying that until [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=273.18s)]
*  it runs up against vocal opposition led by a conservative woman named Phyllis Schlafly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=278.38s)]
*  The Equal Rights Amendment will take away from women some of the most important rights that they now possess. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=284.86s)]
*  She's a self-described housewife, an anti-feminist Republican who wages war against the ERA. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=291.18s)]
*  First of all, it will have a powerful, dramatic adverse effect on the rights of the draft age girl. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=299.58s)]
*  Her basic argument is that it would actually take away rights from women. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=309.58s)]
*  That every 18 year old girl will be compelled to be given a draft number and to be available for call up. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  By eroding traditional gender roles. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  The second category of women who will be hurt by the Equal Rights Amendment are wives. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=322.62s)]
*  With a message that traditional women's roles are a privilege. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=327.42s)]
*  The laws of every one of our 50 states make it the legal obligation of the husband to support his wife. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=333.98s)]
*  And she organized a very effective grassroots campaign where women showed up in droves [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=341.66s)]
*  to push this message on state legislators who had to vote on this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=349.58000000000004s)]
*  And it works. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=353.82s)]
*  It lost in Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia, and now Florida. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=354.94s)]
*  No other states are willing to adopt it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=360.06s)]
*  And the reason that matters is because in the original piece of legislation that had passed [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=362.62s)]
*  Congress, there was a deadline for when the states had to ratify. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=367.74s)]
*  And in fact, a few states even go back and try and rescind their ratifications. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=372.14s)]
*  The latest skirmish in the pitched battle over ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment is now history. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  And one of the casualties may very well be final passage of the amendment itself. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=382.46s)]
*  So by 1982, which is the ultimate deadline that Congress came up with, they're short. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  This amendment has not met the legal requirements to become the 28th Amendment. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=394.06s)]
*  So basically, you're saying by the early 1980s, this seems to be quite dead. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=403.41999999999996s)]
*  You might think so, but the debate begins about whether or not the time limit is something that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=408.54s)]
*  should be taken seriously or whether that deadline was always meaningless. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=415.42s)]
*  Hmm. Just explain that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=419.58s)]
*  So constitutional amendments, first of all, each one has taken its own circuitous path to passing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=421.26s)]
*  And they don't normally have ratification deadlines. An example is the 27th Amendment. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=428.3s)]
*  It was ratified in 1992. That's two centuries after Congress first passed it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=433.02s)]
*  So supporters of the ERA argue that the Constitution itself never mentions deadlines [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=439.41999999999996s)]
*  for an amendment. So they just are meaningless and do not exist. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=446.06s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=450.85999999999996s)]
*  And on top of that, there's a real debate about this business of states trying to rescind their [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=451.74s)]
*  ratification. States have tried that in the past on other amendments, on the 14th and 15th [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=458.7s)]
*  Amendments. And their original ratifications were still counted in the final count that had those [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  become part of the Constitution. So there is some real legitimate gray area here. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=471.26s)]
*  There's a lot of legal gray area here, yes. So this thing just kind of sits on the shelf for decades [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=477.26s)]
*  until Donald Trump is elected president. And three more Democratic Party controlled state legislators, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=484.62s)]
*  Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia, who are motivated by women who are outraged that Trump has won [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=492.46s)]
*  and what this will mean for women's rights. Not to mention the Me Too movement, which was at its peak, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=498.7s)]
*  adopt the ERA. So it suddenly hits the magic number of 38, three quarters of the states. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=504.54s)]
*  It has still been passed by Congress. So on paper, according to supporters, it has cleared all the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=512.38s)]
*  bars. The ERA has been ratified and should be part of the Constitution. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=518.5400000000001s)]
*  If you believe that that congressional deadline is not real. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=523.6600000000001s)]
*  Correct. So if you think it has met all the legal requirements and that the deadline is not in the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=527.58s)]
*  Constitution, all that is left to do at this point is basically paperwork. The National Archivist, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  who's responsible for the certification and publication of constitutional amendments, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=540.86s)]
*  just needs to publish the ERA as the 28th Amendment. And then it is part of the Constitution. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=545.74s)]
*  A really interesting argument. But, and this is a big but, the Trump White [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=551.74s)]
*  House at the time issues a legal opinion saying that the archivist cannot do that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=557.98s)]
*  And that's because of the deadline. They say that Congress set that 1982 deadline. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=563.58s)]
*  And that because of that, this is all null and void. Anything that happened after that is dead. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=568.86s)]
*  And in 2022, when Biden is president, the Biden White House defends that position. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=574.54s)]
*  The Trump position that the deadline matters and that this is not suddenly a constitutional [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=583.5s)]
*  amendment. Correct. So again, we are in a legal gray area. In 2023, supporters of the ERA go to [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=589.9s)]
*  federal court to get a ruling about the deadline issue. And they lose. A federal court says that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=598.06s)]
*  the deadline is real. So it's looking less gray and the chances of the Equal Rights Amendment [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=605.18s)]
*  becoming part of the Constitution are looking less likely. But over the past few months, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=611.5s)]
*  Democrats have decided to give it a final try. And what does that even mean, really? After [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=617.8199999999999s)]
*  Roe was overturned, Democrats saw this as more urgent than ever. That the ERA could be a tool [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=625.26s)]
*  to protect abortion rights at the federal level. That it could anchor a right to an abortion in [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=633.5s)]
*  the Constitution. And they have a Democratic president with the power to make this happen. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=638.38s)]
*  And they want to just treat this like it's already the law of the land. It's passed Congress. It's [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=643.58s)]
*  got the three quarters of states ratified. Just order the archivist to publish it. And sure, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=649.1800000000001s)]
*  it'll invite a legal challenge, but that's the next step. So they literally say, all Joe Biden [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=655.74s)]
*  has to do is pick up the phone, have a two minute phone conversation with the archivist, order her [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  to publish it. And then they'll deal with whatever comes next after that. 45 senators, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=668.14s)]
*  including Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, have written a letter to Biden saying, pick up [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=674.06s)]
*  the phone and call. House Democrats, over 100, all saying, pick up the phone. Yes, it will invite a [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=679.18s)]
*  court challenge. But the point is that this would dare Republicans to have a legal battle to take [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=686.46s)]
*  away equal rights for women. To say, no, we're fighting against this very simple amendment that [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=693.58s)]
*  says women deserve equal rights. Dare them to start that legal battle. And the lawmaker who has [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=699.0200000000001s)]
*  really taken up this mantle is the junior senator from New York, Kirsten Gillibrand, who has made [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=709.0200000000001s)]
*  it a priority to persuade Biden that he can and he must do something on this, that he is the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=715.74s)]
*  president who can make the Equal Rights Amendment part of the Constitution. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=723.74s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=737.1800000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=737.9s)]
*  Good morning, Senator Gillibrand. How are you? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=743.98s)]
*  I'm well. How are you? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=745.8199999999999s)]
*  Good. It's nice to see you. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=747.5s)]
*  I reached Senator Kirsten Gillibrand inside her office on Capitol Hill last week. Sorry. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=748.6999999999999s)]
*  And thank you for putting on headphones. I know it is not the most glamorous way to start your day, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=753.98s)]
*  but- [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=759.74s)]
*  I don't mind. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=760.4599999999999s)]
*  I wonder if you can, just to start, remember when you first learned that equal rights for women [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=762.14s)]
*  were not mentioned in the Constitution. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=768.54s)]
*  Right. Well, I've known for a long time that the Equal Rights Amendment is not part of the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=771.9799999999999s)]
*  Constitution. Recently, I started looking into the law and looking into actually what it takes to [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=777.3399999999999s)]
*  make a constitutional amendment. And I realized pretty quickly it was about Article 5 of the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=784.4599999999999s)]
*  Constitution that sets out two things that need to be accomplished to become a constitutional [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=790.9399999999999s)]
*  amendment. You need two-thirds of the House and Senate to vote in favor of it. That happened in [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=796.14s)]
*  the 1970s. It needs three-quarters of the states to ratify. The last state to ratify was Virginia [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=801.1s)]
*  in 2020. And so I realized really quickly that the two things that are required by the Constitution [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=808.78s)]
*  have been met. So what's supposed to happen is when the two standards are met by Article 5, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=815.1s)]
*  two-thirds House and Senate, pass it, ratified by three-quarters of the state, the archivist, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=822.22s)]
*  who has a ministerial job only, he or she is not supposed to analyze the law. They're not supposed [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=827.82s)]
*  to have a deep think about it. They're just supposed to sign and publish when the two things [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=833.98s)]
*  are done. And because Trump was president in 2020, his office of legal counsel issued a memo [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=840.06s)]
*  telling the archivist he couldn't sign and publish. And that memo said, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=846.9399999999999s)]
*  timelines matter and you took too long to get this added to the Constitution. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=851.0999999999999s)]
*  And they cited a decision saying that all constitutional amendments have to be done in [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=856.54s)]
*  a timely way. Well, the 27th Amendment took 203 years to become a constitutional amendment. So [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=860.78s)]
*  clearly timeliness is not a standard. And so I looked further into what the law says about [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=867.74s)]
*  timelines and whether this timeline that Congress had put in as a seven years deadline in the preamble [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=873.9s)]
*  was actually constitutionally operative. And there was actually precedent that talked about cases that [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=880.4599999999999s)]
*  had timelines and deadlines and saying they were not valid. And I realized that the strength of the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  arguments were actually on our side. So I've been asking the White House to either issue a new OLC [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=893.26s)]
*  memo. And if they don't want to do that, then direct the archivist to sign and publish on the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=900.22s)]
*  basis that the two things that Article 5 requires have been completed. Got it. And we're going to [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=906.46s)]
*  get to all the ways in which you have brought and tried to bring that request to the Biden White House. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=912.46s)]
*  But I think listeners will appreciate you explaining in a kind of bigger step back way, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=919.42s)]
*  why you and why so many other Democrats want the ERA now. Putting aside the legal arguments [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=925.3399999999999s)]
*  for just a moment, what in your mind does the Equal Rights Amendment achieve at this point [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=932.86s)]
*  that the country's current laws and jurisprudence, especially around the 14th Amendment's [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=938.78s)]
*  Equal Rights Clause, does not provide? What gaps does it fill if it becomes the 28th Amendment of [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=943.82s)]
*  the Constitution? Well, if you noticed in the Dobbs decision, Justice Alito alluded that there is no [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=951.34s)]
*  right to privacy in the Constitution and there's nothing protecting women for these issues in the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=960.94s)]
*  Constitution. Well, that really highlighted the need for the Equal Rights Amendment to be part of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=966.0600000000001s)]
*  the Constitution because Equal Rights Amendments across the board in states, states like Connecticut, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=971.98s)]
*  states like New Mexico, there's current litigations in places like Pennsylvania. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=978.54s)]
*  When a state has an Equal Rights Amendment, in the case of reproductive rights, they have found [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=984.38s)]
*  that if a woman is denied access to healthcare for reproductive rights, including abortion, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=989.82s)]
*  that it's fundamentally unequal. And so in the cases of Connecticut and New Mexico, women on [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=996.78s)]
*  Medicaid were given access to abortion services because they were denied it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1003.9s)]
*  And they said that was unequal under the law. So for you, the Equal Rights Amendment, perhaps not [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1008.46s)]
*  exclusively, but foremostly, is about creating in the Constitution a federal protection for abortion [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1015.02s)]
*  rights, which you think has already happened in states whose constitutions have [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1021.82s)]
*  something similar to the Equal Rights Amendment in it. Correct. Because if you have equality, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1026.6200000000001s)]
*  let's just look at Dobbs. Dobbs ruled that women of reproductive years do not have a right to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1031.74s)]
*  privacy. Red states have then implemented that to say women of reproductive years don't have the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1038.78s)]
*  right to travel across state lines to get access to healthcare. They have decided women of reproductive [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1044.38s)]
*  years don't have a right to have private conversations on their Facebook pages with [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1051.18s)]
*  their mother about seeking abortion services, that women don't have the right to privacy to receive [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1055.02s)]
*  medicine in the mail. Imagine how men in America would feel if they were told today that they too [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1060.7s)]
*  do not have the right to privacy to cross state lines or to receive medicine in the mail or to [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1067.5800000000002s)]
*  have private conversations on social media with their families. They would start a revolution. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1072.3s)]
*  I believe if we had an Equal Rights Amendment, Dobbs would be vitiated. Dobbs would no longer [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1078.8600000000001s)]
*  count because it is applying a standard to women only based on their gender that they don't have [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1084.46s)]
*  a right to privacy and therefore have no access to the healthcare that they need. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1091.66s)]
*  That's a pretty big and important claim. I wonder if it's at all disputed. You'd know better than [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1096.5400000000002s)]
*  I would that explicitly prohibiting gender-based discrimination in the Constitution, which is what [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1101.18s)]
*  the Equal Rights Amendment would do, would in your words vitiate, obviate, tear us under [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1107.34s)]
*  the Dobbs decision entirely? I think it could. It would be a strong legal argument that you are [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1113.02s)]
*  discriminating against women based on our gender and in this instance denying us access to life-saving [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1119.6599999999999s)]
*  care. Okay, once Senator Gillibrand, you decide for all these reasons, both kind of legal and [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1125.1799999999998s)]
*  practical, that this is important to you, that you make this case to President Biden. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1133.4199999999998s)]
*  What do you do? What have you done so far to try to make this case to the President, to his aides? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1141.1s)]
*  I wonder if you can kind of walk us through all of that. So I started to ask for meetings with [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1148.1399999999999s)]
*  President Biden. Over a year ago, I used every opportunity that I had with the President [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1155.26s)]
*  or with the First Lady or with Vice President Harris or with Vice President Harris's husband [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1162.14s)]
*  or with their chiefs of staff or with senior advisors in the administration to make the case [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1167.66s)]
*  that the ERA is valid. And I have argued with his lawyer ad nauseam and he disagrees with me. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1173.18s)]
*  But I think my legal arguments are supported by far more people than support his. My argument [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1182.46s)]
*  supported by the ABA. The American Bar Association. And my argument supported by [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1187.74s)]
*  numbers of attorneys general from dozens of states and the weight of the law is on our side. Wait, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1192.06s)]
*  should I intuit that you have not gotten this meeting? No, I have not gotten the meeting yet. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1198.14s)]
*  I'm still asking for the meeting. Mr. President, I would like to meet with you for five minutes. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1201.98s)]
*  I would like to make my best case to you. Forgive me for asking this. Is it strange for you to have [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1207.82s)]
*  to essentially plead through intermediaries, whether perhaps in this moment we are one of them, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1213.5s)]
*  to get a couple of moments one on one with the President? You know, I don't know what the issue [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1220.38s)]
*  is. I think perhaps the campaign got in the way because it became a question is, do we want to do [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1226.62s)]
*  this in the middle of a campaign? Shouldn't we wait till after the campaign? Maybe those were [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1232.06s)]
*  concerns. We did polling. We have polling showing that the American people support this. We've [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1236.14s)]
*  really just tried to make the case to all of the senior advisors that not only is this actually [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1241.74s)]
*  accurate legally, but that it is the right thing to do. So how do you understand Senator Biden's [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1247.58s)]
*  seeming reluctance to engage this? He's not taking the meeting with you. He's not speaking out about [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1255.98s)]
*  this. Well, I don't know that it's the President. I think it's the team. I don't know. I got to tell [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1261.26s)]
*  you, when I pitched it to him, I pitched it to him with my 30 seconds that I had in a photo line, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1265.9s)]
*  Yes, when President Biden came to New York for the celebration of the Stonewall Inn as a national [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1271.74s)]
*  monument, I made sure I got to that photo line. I said, Mr. President, I think you have an [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1279.34s)]
*  opportunity to direct the archivist to sign and publish the ERA. You got it out. I said, and if [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1285.5s)]
*  you do, it will be everything. It will guarantee women reproductive rights. It will guarantee them [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1290.38s)]
*  equality under the law. It will be the cornerstone of your administration. And I said, I said, you [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1295.5s)]
*  don't have a formal role, but the archivist does, and she needs courage. And I believe if you tell [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1300.7s)]
*  her or direct her or do a new OLC memo, she will do it. And he said, so do you want me to make a [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1306.94s)]
*  big deal about it? I said, yes, I do. And that was our conversation. So it was very positive. So I've [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1313.3400000000001s)]
*  not had a negative reaction. Do you think Senator that perhaps the thing that may be holding him, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1319.98s)]
*  the thing that may be holding him, and if not him, those around him up here, is their fear that this [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1327.5s)]
*  won't survive the inevitable legal challenge that will come based on the 1982 deadline, that they [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1332.94s)]
*  just think that this is futile and symbolic. Look, no matter what approach you take on this [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1340.38s)]
*  Equal Rights Amendment, it will go up to the Supreme Court. This is the only route that is [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1349.1000000000001s)]
*  possible, I think, in the near future. And why wouldn't you do it now as an opportunity to stand [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1354.46s)]
*  up for what you believe in? You just mentioned the Supreme Court. You no doubt know that one of the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1362.7s)]
*  great liberal lions of the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said in 2020 that she believed [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1369.66s)]
*  that as much as the world, as the country needed the ERA, that the best way to do it, the right way [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1377.98s)]
*  to do it, was to start over. She said, and this is her quote, I would like to see a new beginning [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1384.38s)]
*  rather than an effort to just take the current legislation, having missed the 1982 deadline [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1391.98s)]
*  in her mind, and make it law now. And so what do you say to a towering legal figure and theoretical [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1398.7s)]
*  ally like that saying, no, I don't think you can do this. I think you have to go back to the beginning. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1406.22s)]
*  You have to do this whole thing all over again. So I disagree with her analysis. And you have to [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1412.06s)]
*  understand Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a great legal mind. She was a unbelievable scholar and justice [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1418.78s)]
*  that did great things for our country. She knows nothing about politics. It's not her job to [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1429.66s)]
*  understand politics. If you start over, you will never see reproductive freedom or equality for [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1436.14s)]
*  women in our lifetimes because it's become a political wedge issue. So there are many people [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1441.98s)]
*  in the Senate today, in the House today, that if you ask them privately, do you believe women [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1449.5s)]
*  deserve equality? They're going to say yes, but their vote on equality will be about their position [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1455.34s)]
*  on reproductive rights. So that's the truth. And so I respect Justice Ginsburg for her legal acumen. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1461.26s)]
*  I do not respect her view on this issue because I think she's wrong. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1468.22s)]
*  Even Senator, if you were to get President Biden to do this, a big if, you know that you face one [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1472.38s)]
*  last meaningful obstacle because just a couple of days ago, the archivist came out, probably in [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1478.94s)]
*  response to your outspoken efforts here, and said, I will not do this. I will not make the Equal Rights [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1484.62s)]
*  Amendment, the 28th Amendment to the Constitution because in her legal analysis, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1495.18s)]
*  Good point, Michael. Her legal analysis, she's not a lawyer. She knows nothing about the law. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1501.74s)]
*  And for her to insert herself as a legal analyst in this whole process is unconstitutional. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1509.02s)]
*  She is supposed to publish the ERA because the two standards of Article 5 have been met. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1516.46s)]
*  I mean, your frustration is so palpable to me. I've watched you, I've covered you for many years, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1522.94s)]
*  and I now have this vision of you tiptoeing across the White House lawn at some godly hour [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1530.22s)]
*  and knocking on the front door. Well, I mentioned it in the Christmas party photo line, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1537.8999999999999s)]
*  and this is why I know Jill Biden knows about it. I said, Mr. President, I'm still asking for five [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1543.6599999999999s)]
*  minutes to tell you about the Equal Rights Amendment. And Jill said, we know all about it. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1548.46s)]
*  I said, great, I just need five minutes because I really believe someone is advising him differently, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1553.98s)]
*  and I don't think they know all the things I know. And I would like to have him, at least as the [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1561.66s)]
*  president of the United States, make this decision fairly with all the information in front of him, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1567.42s)]
*  and let him, as the president, make history. Lawyers write briefs, presidents make history. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1572.78s)]
*  Well, Senator, thank you very much for your time. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1586.3s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1589.5s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1590.06s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. Even as Republicans averted a government shutdown over [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1603.34s)]
*  the weekend, they exposed a deep rift between President-elect Trump and hardline House Republicans [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1622.6999999999998s)]
*  over spending and debt. Trump had triggered the crisis by ordering House Republicans to raise the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1629.5s)]
*  federal debt ceiling, hoping that doing so before he was in office would avoid a messy showdown [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1636.78s)]
*  over the issue next year. Instead, nearly 40 House Republicans defied Trump, saying that his plan [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1643.34s)]
*  would generate too much debt. The spending package that ultimately avoided a shutdown, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1650.54s)]
*  which passed both chambers of Congress on Saturday morning, extends current spending [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1656.62s)]
*  levels until mid-March and pushes the debate over the debt ceiling into next year, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1661.5s)]
*  when Republicans will control the White House and both chambers of Congress. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtHqsaWz4Ww&t=1667.58s)]
