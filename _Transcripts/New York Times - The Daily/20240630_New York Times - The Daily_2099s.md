# 'Animal,' Episode 5 Wolves
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCnSQ0Hu4nc)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Today we have something really special for you.
*  A blissful break from the news.
*  It's a new series from NYT Audio called Animal.
*  My colleague Sam Anderson from the Times Magazine traveled the world to have encounters with
*  animals not to claim them or to tame them, but just to appreciate them.
*  Each episode is a journey to get closer to a creature that Sam loves.
*  For the next six weeks, we'll be running this limited series every Sunday here on the
*  Daily Feed.
*  But if you want to hear all the episodes right now, you can search for it wherever you get
*  your podcasts.
*  Today, episode five.
*  Take a listen.
*  From the New York Times, this is Animal.
*  I'm Sam Anderson.
*  Episode five.
*  Wolves.
*  Well, we should...
*  The shop closes at six.
*  Do you think we'll be back by then?
*  Yes, 5 15.
*  Uh, maybe.
*  I can't imagine that.
*  There'll be like a ton to do.
*  No, I agree.
*  I don't think we need to do that much.
*  I mean, we just want to make the pilgrimage to the statue.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  You know about the statue?
*  No.
*  Okay, we're going to tell you in the car.
*  And you can tell the driver.
*  The first thing I remember about our trip to the wolf statue is that we almost didn't
*  go.
*  People told us not to bother.
*  The memorial is out in the middle of absolute nowhere on the edge of this tiny village
*  in Japan.
*  It would take all day to get there and probably be a giant anticlimax.
*  But I was already in Japan because I was working on a story for the magazine about Hayao Miyazaki,
*  the animator.
*  And since I had come this far, I just felt like I really needed to do this.
*  That's really boring.
*  That train from Tokyo to Kyoto.
*  Regular train from Kyoto to a smaller city called Nara, just famous for its deer.
*  We come out of the train station and it's pouring rain.
*  That's another reason not to go on the pilgrimage because it's just soaking rain constantly
*  all day long.
*  I'm with Crystal Duhaime, who's carrying a gigantic microphone around everywhere.
*  And then Samson Yee, our incredible interpreter.
*  And so we step out of the train station into the rain and there's this black car waiting
*  for us.
*  And out steps our driver, who's this 30 something man, nicely dressed.
*  He's wearing like a gray suit with a red tie.
*  Samson talks to him and says his name is Daisuke.
*  Daisuke-san to be polite.
*  And Samson climbed into the front of the taxi to sit next to Daisuke so that he can interpret
*  our conversation.
*  Yes, it's okay for you to record his talk.
*  He might not be able to meet your expectations.
*  We start heading out of the city on this kind of wild, windy back road and immediately we're
*  sort of in the middle of nowhere and it's still pouring, it's foggy, we're passing through
*  woods and bamboo and it is really beautiful.
*  It feels like we're driving into an old landscape painting.
*  So Samson, let me tell you about the statues since you have no idea what we're doing.
*  Yeah, I remember asking.
*  Well maybe ask Daisuke-san if he knows anything about the Japanese wolf.
*  Can you ask Daisuke-san, our driver, if he knows anything about the Japanese wolf?
*  So Samson did and no, he'd never heard about it.
*  But...
*  I don't know anything about the wolf but I love animals and I have a Chihuahua at home.
*  I have a Chihuahua.
*  What's the name of the Chihuahua?
*  It's Gotaro.
*  Gotaro.
*  Gotaro.
*  Gotaro.
*  Gotaro.
*  Boy's name.
*  It's a boy's name but he's a girl.
*  He has a boy's name but he's a girl.
*  Poor Gotaro.
*  And Samson laughed because Gotaro is a very male Japanese name.
*  It's like apparently like some kind of warrior name.
*  He said the Chinese character for it means like hard metal.
*  And Daisuke named this Chihuahua the most masculine tough name he could think of because
*  Chihuahuas are so fierce and have such strong personalities.
*  So he did that deliberately.
*  And the fact that he would connect that to wolves, that was the funny thing about him.
*  It's like instantly we said wolves and he was like, oh I love animals and I have a dog,
*  a Chihuahua.
*  Which is on one hand a hilarious answer but on the other hand makes perfect sense because
*  wolves and dogs, I came to learn on this trip, are essentially the same thing.
*  I mean we went to talk to one of the great dog scientists on planet Earth and he was
*  telling me that dogs are really just wolves that have developed over thousands of years
*  a very intimate relationship with human beings.
*  He's done all this incredible research including discovering that dogs cry when their owners
*  come home after a long period away.
*  They have moisture in their eyes and wolves don't.
*  So that's one of the ways they're different.
*  But otherwise they're just, it's more a continuum than it is a bright line that divides them.
*  So Daisuke got that right away.
*  He was like, you're asking me about wolves?
*  I'm going to talk about my dog.
*  I'm just explaining what we've been doing in the last few days.
*  So I'd been spending the last few days of my trip in Japan learning about wolves.
*  And so I started telling Daisuke-san the epic saga of the Japanese wolf.
*  The basic story is there used to be wolves in these mountains everywhere all over Japan.
*  I think of a wolf as an American.
*  I think of like a big timber wolf or a gray wolf, like a big snarling mean dog.
*  Japanese wolves were different.
*  They were smaller and sort of a reddish, khaki color and cute, weirdly cute for a wolf.
*  Before I went on this trip, I read this book called The Lost Wolves of Japan
*  by a historian named Brett Walker.
*  And basically for many thousands of years, wolves roamed all over Japan and people revered them.
*  They saw them as sacred guardians.
*  They protected crops.
*  People worshiped at wolf shrines and they left offerings of rice and beans outside of wolf dens.
*  But then in the 1700s, there was this big rabies outbreak that made wolves actually quite dangerous.
*  Wolves were killing people.
*  And then in the 1800s, there was a huge cultural shift in Japan where the country started to, quote unquote, modernize.
*  People started doing western-style agriculture, huge cattle herds.
*  And so wolves began to seem like pests.
*  They were killing livestock.
*  They were encroaching on these cities that were growing deeper into the wilderness.
*  And so Japan decided it was done with its wolves.
*  And the government sends out these hunting parties to systematically exterminate the Japanese wolf.
*  And they did.
*  They used guns.
*  They used poison.
*  They used traps.
*  As far as we know, the last Japanese wolf was killed in 1905.
*  And it's historically documented and they know where it was exactly and they know which wolf it was.
*  It was a male wolf and it was brought dead and sold to a western man in 1905.
*  They say the last known Japanese wolf.
*  It was seen kind of skulking around this lumber yard in a little remote village.
*  And somebody shot it and sold it to a western man who was passing through town collecting zoological specimens.
*  And so this statue that we're going to is the memorial to that last wolf.
*  It's a black metal statue based on the body of that wolf near where that wolf died.
*  And so we were driving out to see.
*  Daisuke was the chattiest, probably the chattiest cab driver I've ever had.
*  And whatever he talked about, it always came back to Gotoro.
*  For instance, he was telling us like, oh, I'm a YouTuber and I have a YouTube channel about cars.
*  And I said, oh, what's the name of the YouTube channel?
*  Because I immediately wanted to look it up.
*  And he said something, something.
*  I don't speak Japanese, so I can understand her.
*  But I distinctly heard the word Gotoro.
*  I said, wait a second. Did he say Gotoro again?
*  Is his YouTube channel named after the Chihuahua?
*  And Samson said, yes, it's basically driving with Gotoro.
*  Driving channel.
*  So where are we? We really are out in the middle of nowhere on this tiny road.
*  So we are in this car for a very long time, driving on these windy roads into the mountains
*  through forests. There's just occasional houses, fog, still pouring rain.
*  And then Daisuke-san starts telling us his life story,
*  which turned out to be much more than we were prepared for.
*  So we are still in this car.
*  Maybe we're halfway into the trip at this point.
*  And Daisuke started ruminating and then told us the entire story of his life, basically.
*  I remember Samson being like, OK, he's telling me his life story now.
*  So he's talking about his life story now and how he used to live in Osaka.
*  Osaka? Osaka?
*  So he got married with his wife in Osaka and lived there for two years.
*  He used to drive a garbage truck.
*  And his wife's dad, after they got married two years, asked him to come live with them.
*  So his parents-in-law asked him to come live with them.
*  And her dad, the wife's dad, worked in the same taxi company as this company.
*  And hence he and his wife, and Otaro, moved from Osaka to Kyoto, to Nara,
*  and lived with his father for four to five years.
*  But then his father-in-law left the taxi company.
*  So, yeah, he's a garbage truck driver in Osaka.
*  And he got married and they agreed to move in with his father-in-law, his wife's father.
*  In Japan, traditionally, it's a very hierarchical society.
*  So your wife's father would be someone you pay a lot of respect to.
*  So they moved in with him.
*  So actually, his father-in-law didn't like animals at the time.
*  But then he knew that if Daisuke's family would come and live with him, the dog would come along.
*  The chihuahua would come along.
*  And because Otaro is a dog you have in the house, so his father-in-law knew that.
*  And then they brought the dog over.
*  And then, when his father quit his job, he stayed at home all the time.
*  So the band started.
*  So the father-in-law started being really rough to the chihuahua.
*  So like violent.
*  So Daisuke says a couple times he came home from work and it seemed like Gotoro was hurt.
*  And there'd been no one home all day except Gotoro and the father-in-law.
*  So at the time, for the first and second time, when he saw the scars,
*  he knew immediately that the scars from the dog was caused by a person.
*  So unless there is some thief who broke into the house, it could only have been his father-in-law.
*  So he approached his father-in-law and told him to stop, stop hitting the dog.
*  And he was telling his father-in-law that you wouldn't like it if someone hit your grandson or grandchild, his son or child.
*  So please stop.
*  I warned him twice.
*  We talked about it.
*  And the third time, when he came home from work, his left eye was really red and bulging.
*  So when I took him to the hospital, his left eye was really red and bulging.
*  So when I took him to the hospital, his left eye was really red and bulging.
*  So when I took him to the hospital, his left eye was really red and bulging.
*  He is a dog, but he is family.
*  So I couldn't forgive him.
*  So we can't live together anymore.
*  Solar panel.
*  So we decided to leave the house.
*  It doesn't matter if it's your wife or children.
*  If they come with me, they can come with me.
*  If they stay here, they can stay here.
*  But if they stay here, they can't live together anymore.
*  So he can stay with his parents, his dad if she wants, but I'm leaving.
*  I'm leaving with Kodaro.
*  In the end, there are five of us.
*  Me, my wife, and my two children and Chihuahua left that house.
*  Now we're living away from the dad.
*  We don't see our dad much.
*  We've never seen her dad ever again after that incident.
*  When we fact-checked the story, we talked to Daisuke's wife and the vet who treated Gotoro for her injuries.
*  And they both corroborated what Daisuke told us.
*  And we tried to reach the father-in-law directly, but we weren't able to talk to him.
*  Daisuke told us his father-in-law denied hurting Gotoro.
*  We also found out a couple of other things.
*  First, Gotoro actually lost the vision in her right eye, not her left.
*  It was a detached retina.
*  And also that Gotoro was not always named Gotoro.
*  Originally, she was named Love.
*  That's actually the name the vet knew her by.
*  And Daisuke says when his father-in-law got angry, he would shout the word love over and over.
*  And Daisuke decided he didn't want to relive that trauma anymore.
*  And that's when he thought of this name Gotoro.
*  He wanted to give the dog this tough warrior name.
*  Sorry the story's gotten all serious, as I said.
*  That's very intense. So Gotoro has no left eye.
*  The dog's eyes are the main thing.
*  Most of the time, the dog's nose is the main thing.
*  The more humans think about it, the more it's a part of their lives.
*  I mean, their lives.
*  So he's saying, you know how when humans...
*  Like Yakisawa actually.
*  You know how when humans, when you lose sight, use your sight of one eye,
*  it can really affect your everyday life.
*  But then it's not so much for a dog because for a dog, of course, the dog can see.
*  But he also relies on his smell a lot more.
*  So perhaps it doesn't affect the dog's life.
*  It's interesting when he said life, when he referred to dog,
*  he says jinsei, which means human life.
*  So he really thinks that the dog is just like human.
*  And the fact that he has lost his left eye might not have as much of an effect to the dog
*  as it would if it was a person.
*  As a human, it's a sad event for a dog.
*  It's a new event.
*  But for a dog, it's a problem that's gotten worse.
*  So he's letting it land in his body.
*  I mean, despite the fact that the incident made me really angry,
*  and really sad, and it was like a huge thing to me, perhaps,
*  and I tried to think it this way, I tried to put it this way,
*  perhaps for the dog, it's almost like a blocked nose, you know,
*  and maybe it's not that big a deal for him.
*  I tried to think it like that so that I can keep saying, I guess.
*  And it's really, you know, the dog itself is really healthy,
*  and Goutaro is just fine, doing just fine.
*  If we have a chance later, I can show you a video of Goutaro.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's saying how Chihuahua like wolves how to.
*  So I just saw a sign that said the name of where we're going.
*  Yes.
*  What is the name of the place?
*  It's called Chihuahua.
*  I just saw a sign that said the name of where we're going.
*  Yes.
*  What is it called again?
*  Higashi-Yoshino.
*  Yeah, and it had a wolf on it. It had like a little wolf silhouette.
*  Did you see that?
*  I think we are closer, maybe four or five minutes away.
*  OK.
*  Well, this life of story of his has become so much more intense than I imagined.
*  I thought we were just going to sell our taxi and go and see a statue.
*  Goutaro.
*  Yeah, I mean, as we approach the wolf statue here, I think that's actually the perfect conversation for us to have approaching the statue.
*  Because part of why I think I felt drawn to see this is because I think it's a very interesting place.
*  Part of why I think I felt drawn to see this statue was that it does represent one individual animal.
*  It's not just a symbolic wolf.
*  It is an animal that was as much an individual as Goutaro or as Walnut, my dog, or as any of us in this car.
*  This was a specific creature.
*  And as the last wolf, it had lost everyone.
*  It had lost its family, its friends, its whole community in pack.
*  And that's just really deep to think about.
*  So, yeah, suddenly we're there.
*  It's just like the GPS was like, this is it.
*  We're here.
*  And it was really a nothing.
*  Like it was.
*  It's really quiet, maybe because it's Sunday.
*  There was like a little roadside sign and then you just had to kind of pull off the road onto the shoulder.
*  Traffic, you know, cars driving by were just right there driving by right next to you.
*  And so it was really a nothing of a sight.
*  That said, I think we're going to have to go back to the car.
*  That said, we get out.
*  It's pouring rain.
*  Daisuke gives us umbrellas and it's so beautiful.
*  We truly are out in the country.
*  I mean, there's a road that runs by, but right on the other side of the road is this beautiful river rushing with all this rain.
*  And then just these cascading mountains with fog all over them that really look like a beautiful classic Japanese painting.
*  Be careful. I don't think cars stop.
*  I don't think anyone ever comes here.
*  It was completely quiet except for when occasionally a car would go racing past.
*  There's a big sort of stone tablet with a lot of Japanese on it that Samson read to us.
*  What does it say?
*  So it says wolf died and its spirits exist, lives on.
*  So wolf dies, but its spirits live on.
*  I feel like shy to approach the wolf.
*  We've come all this way and I feel like hesitant to, but I guess let's go see him.
*  There's something really powerful about the scale of it being the actual scale of the body of the animal itself.
*  It's so much smaller than I thought.
*  I've seen a photo of it before, but standing in front of it, it looks like a pet dog.
*  It looks like a million dogs that I've played with.
*  Just kind of like a small medium dog.
*  It's just like cute, but it's also fierce. It's this black metal.
*  It's got its mouth wide open. You can see its teeth.
*  I think it's howling, which reminds me they call it, hold on, looking up my Japanese term.
*  I had learned this word earlier on the trip, this incredible Japanese word, which is power spoto,
*  which is just adoption from English, power spot.
*  So just a place that's really full of power.
*  And this to me standing by the statue was powerful.
*  Just this humble, modest little thing, kind of an afterthought of a memorial.
*  One Japanese term from the book we were reading, it says the Japanese once revered the wolf as
*  Oguchi no Magami, or large mouthed pure god.
*  And you can see the large mouth. I mean, the jaws are wide open.
*  It's howling. I really would love to hear what that howl sounds like.
*  So yeah, we stood and Samson, who, one of the great things about Samson is he is just completely
*  unflappable, unimpressed by anything.
*  So how do you feel having been on this journey with us?
*  Knowing all that you know now about the wolf story, coming all this ridiculous way to make this pilgrimage
*  to stand at this statue that no one ever comes to, I think, pretty much.
*  How do you feel standing in front of it? Was it worth it? Do you feel anything?
*  When I first heard about the story that we were going to go after an animal that was supposed to be extinct
*  like over a hundred years ago, I wasn't sure what I was going to expect.
*  And then we're here now. And I do feel listening to you talk about how this guy here we have in front of me,
*  this story in particular, lost everything. And he is the last one.
*  Like, what would the last statue of a person be like? What would the last statue of a dog or cat be like?
*  How would a human think of that? Especially in Japan when he is literally a god, big god.
*  And now he is just a stone in the middle of the street.
*  It's even difficult to park your car because there's no road to this thing.
*  Whilst we pray on other things that we call god that has replaced this thing.
*  That's pretty deep, no?
*  Yeah, so you're having some feelings and thoughts. The unimpressible Samson.
*  It's kind of sad when you think about it.
*  It is really profound. This was the last thing of its kind.
*  And the rain is coming down. It's just like dripping off the fangs of the statue.
*  And then Daisuke pulls out his phone and says, oh, I want to show you a picture of Gotoro.
*  Sure, let's see Gotoro.
*  And as we're standing next to the statue of the last Japanese wolf, he shows us on his phone screen this picture of this little white Chihuahua.
*  It's so cute. Our hearts melted.
*  She's laying on her side in a nest of blankets and having her belly rubbed and her eyes are closed.
*  And it just looks like the sweetest little thing and she's so happy in heaven.
*  One last question for Daisuke-san.
*  So the wolf is howling. I really wonder what its howl sounds like.
*  And I wonder if maybe while he's waiting, could he find that video he told us about?
*  So he went back to wait for us in the car and we stood for a while longer in the rain.
*  And then eventually everyone was starving and we had to go get something to eat.
*  And we got back in the car and Daisuke said, I found it.
*  I found the video. And he played us this video.
*  Of Gotoro the Chihuahua howling her little brains out at an ambulance.
*  And it's like the most tender.
*  She's howling so hard and it's such a soft little tender Chihuahua howl.
*  It's so primal. Imagine it coming out past the fangs of this Japanese wolf.
*  Echoing across the wilderness.
*  Gotoro.
