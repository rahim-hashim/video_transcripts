# How the Election Is Sinking a $15 Billion Business Deal
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIX8o8Volxk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  In a highly unusual move last week, the Biden administration signaled that it would block
*  a Japanese company from buying an iconic American company in a critical swing state.
*  Today.
*  My colleague Alan Rapoport on the politics that could do a multi-billion dollar deal
*  and what it says about the new power of American labor.
*  It's Thursday, September 12th.
*  So Alan, there's been this really interesting standoff over the potential acquisition of
*  U.S. steel.
*  And now the sale is in jeopardy.
*  So help us understand why this is important.
*  Well there's a really fascinating dynamic going on here.
*  We have a historic American company that was once the largest company in the whole United
*  States.
*  And now it's on the brink of being bought by a Japanese company called Nippon Steel.
*  And so a lot of people, including workers, the union, lawmakers, are not happy about
*  this at all.
*  And last week we got word that President Biden was actually preparing to go ahead and block
*  this deal, which in a lot of ways was pretty surprising.
*  And why is that surprising?
*  Normally presidents don't go ahead and interfere in foreign acquisitions like this, especially
*  ones that are between a U.S. company and countries that are allies.
*  But as we all know, we're in an election year and this is not a normal year.
*  So the potential to block this deal is really about a lot more than just the company U.S.
*  Steel.
*  The company is located in Pennsylvania, which is going to be a really important swing state
*  in the upcoming November election.
*  They can actually end up determining who wins the whole thing.
*  Second of all, culturally, it's important because of the way the company's story is
*  interwoven with the history of America and the history of American labor itself.
*  Okay, so let's talk about that.
*  Explain a bit of that history.
*  Well, it all started around the turn of the 20th century.
*  1901, these industrialists like Andrew Carnegie and J.P. Morgan come together to form U.S.
*  Steel.
*  The company actually was the first billion dollar company in the United States.
*  It was known for building some of the most famous bridges and skyscrapers.
*  Some of its steel was even used in the United Nations building.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And its employment actually peaked around World War II when it had 340,000 or so workers.
*  So really a company that just in some ways embodied American power and American greatness
*  in an era where that was really on the ascent.
*  Exactly.
*  After World War II, however, a lot of that started to change.
*  The company had gotten so big, but it had also become kind of complacent.
*  By then, Germany and Japan were sort of starting their steel industries from scratch with a
*  lot of new technology that was more advanced than what U.S. Steel was making.
*  U.S. Steel was actually kind of slow to adopt a lot of these innovations.
*  And by the 1960s and the 1970s, there had been some labor strife within U.S. Steel.
*  There had been shutdowns of mills.
*  And the U.S. was finally starting to see a flood of imports from other countries around
*  the world.
*  And it had been pushing hard on the United States government to impose some trade restrictions
*  and tariffs to prevent this flood of foreign steel from totally upending its business.
*  And that was really what started an era of protectionism in the United States.
*  And over the next decade or so, when China eventually started to ramp up its own steel
*  production, that really posed a major threat to the industry and to the company.
*  We saw the U.S. Steel workforce really start to shrink at that point.
*  From 1979, when it had about 170,000 workers, to 1995, it was down to about 20,000 workers,
*  where it is right now.
*  And in Pennsylvania, where it's headquartered, there's only about 4,000 workers left.
*  So how does this company that's really just a shell of its former self, wind up where
*  it is now as this key talking point smack dab in the middle of the American presidential
*  race?
*  Well, a lot of it has to do with Donald Trump.
*  Thank you, everybody.
*  Thank you so much.
*  I greatly appreciate it.
*  Who in his first election campaign back in 2016,
*  With 30 miles from Steel City, Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation.
*  Really put a big focus on the American worker.
*  But our workers' loyalty was repaid, you know it better than anybody, with total betrayal.
*  Steel workers, mining workers, who he said had been left behind by Republicans and Democrats
*  for decades.
*  The politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization, moving our jobs,
*  our wealth, and our factories to Mexico and overseas.
*  He blamed a lot of this on trade deals that had been written by both Republicans and Democratic
*  administrations.
*  And he said he was going to tear those up, make better deals, and he was going to make,
*  you know, American steelworkers great again.
*  The politicians have proven, folks, have proven they do nothing.
*  For years they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were
*  plunged into depression level unemployment.
*  Many of these areas have still never recovered and never will unless I become president.
*  And when he took office, he started imposing big tariffs on steel and aluminum imports
*  from around the world.
*  He said if you don't have steel, you don't have a country.
*  And Democrats were really forced to start embracing these kinds of populist policies
*  as well.
*  Right.
*  Trump really put his finger on something important politically.
*  Does U.S. steel ever recover?
*  I mean, you said that Trump put tariffs on imports.
*  So did that help?
*  It helped for a while and gave the company some breathing room.
*  The company got a bump just after the pandemic when there was a surge in demand for steel,
*  but that didn't last very long.
*  Profits started declining over the last couple of years.
*  The company's stock price had been flat and shareholders have been starting to get frustrated.
*  And last year, some of its rivals started to see U.S. steel as a target.
*  In August, a company called Cleveland Cliffs, which is based in Ohio, put in a bid for the
*  company that was unsolicited, but U.S. steel didn't like it.
*  And that started this whole situation where other companies also started making bids for
*  U.S. steel.
*  And then in December, Nippon Steel, which is the fourth largest steel company in the
*  world and is based in Japan, put in a $15 billion offer for U.S. steel, which they accepted.
*  So the deal was announced and the company thought it was a big premium for U.S. steel.
*  They promised to keep the headquarters in Pittsburgh, invest in plants and bring a lot
*  of new technology that U.S. steel didn't have.
*  But the union felt blindsided and they quickly came out against it and said, we don't support
*  this deal.
*  So what does the union say about it?
*  Why did it not like the deal?
*  Well, when you hear the union leaders talk about their issues with it.
*  ...Zachs and joining us now, David McCall, United Steelworkers Union International President.
*  They list several problems.
*  Some of them are more nuanced than just the fact that it's a Japanese company.
*  U.S. steel has been shutting down the steelmaking capacity in this country over the last several years.
*  They don't trust the fact that Nippon is actually going to not lay off workers.
*  It makes it so insincere as they make a statement there'll be no layoffs, there'll be no plant closures.
*  But in our discussions with them, they say there'll be no plant closures, there'll be
*  no layoffs unless there's a business plan change.
*  And they're concerned about what might happen once their existing contract ends.
*  And for our members, it's making sure that it is a domestic owner that continues to be
*  able to backstop not only our labor agreements, but our pension plans, our retiree health
*  care plans.
*  And to make sure they don't trust the fact that, you know, a lot of the benefits that
*  they currently have are actually going to continue into the future.
*  And Alan, are there grounds for the union to think that?
*  Is that true?
*  It's hard to say.
*  I think a lot of this comes from the fact that they felt blindsided and not looped into
*  the fact that this deal was happening or that management was going to accept it.
*  There was definitely a lot of mistrust between the union and management that's been festering
*  over the last few years.
*  Management leaders have been saying that this is really just a ploy by the chief executive
*  of U.S. Steel to get a big payout or golden parachute, as they say it, when a company
*  changes control to another company.
*  And so while a lot of these issues have been sort of bubbling up under the surface for
*  a while, the unions lobbying against the deal has really been ramping up and intensifying
*  as the election has been drawing closer.
*  And the big question is whether or not all this political pressure is going to work.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So after the deal is announced, the union starts applying political pressure to prevent
*  Nippon Steel from buying U.S. Steel.
*  What happens?
*  How do we see that play out?
*  So almost immediately after the deal was announced in December, there was political pushback,
*  outrage was bubbling up.
*  You were hearing from all kinds of politicians across the political spectrum that this deal
*  should not go through.
*  Democratic Senator John Fetterman from Pennsylvania came out against it.
*  Pennsylvania State Governor Josh Shapiro expressed concerns.
*  J.D. Vance came out saying that the deal, you know, needed to be blocked.
*  But at the presidential level,
*  We saved the steel industry.
*  Now U.S. Steel is being bought by Japan.
*  Donald Trump was the first to make a move coming out against the deal.
*  I would block it.
*  I think it's a horrible thing.
*  When Japan buys U.S. Steel, I would block it instantaneously, absolutely.
*  And his comments put direct pressure on Biden, who was still a candidate at the time.
*  And he had to say something about U.S. Steel.
*  U.S. Steel has been an iconic American company for more than a century.
*  And it should remain a totally American company.
*  He's billed himself as the most pro-union president ever.
*  And by the spring, Biden finally comes out in support of the steelworkers.
*  American owned, American operated by American union steelworkers, the best in the world.
*  And that's going to happen, I promise you.
*  But of course, Biden drops out of the race.
*  And Vice President Harris becomes the Democratic nominee.
*  When unions are strong, America is strong.
*  And we will continue to strengthen America's manufacturing sector.
*  And then she goes ahead and adopts Biden's position on the merger.
*  To drive that point home, she says it at a rally in Pittsburgh on Labor Day.
*  U.S. Steel should remain American owned and American operated.
*  And I will always have the back of America's steelworkers.
*  So it's kind of this funny situation where all the candidates,
*  Trump, Biden and Harris, all agree on a policy.
*  Right. There's this kind of arms race for who can actually show American workers in this state
*  that they have their interests at heart the most.
*  Exactly. I mean, it really shows how labor and steel have become the sort of political
*  poster child in this election.
*  And so that's what set off this protracted standoff.
*  And it's really put U.S. Steel in a difficult situation,
*  trying to figure out what they're going to do with this Nippon bid
*  and figure out whether or not it's going to go forward.
*  So on the national stage, we're seeing the presidential candidates really compete
*  for the steelworkers vote, which makes sense because they need Pennsylvania to win.
*  Biden has actually gone a step further signaling that he will block the deal.
*  But at this point, he's no longer in the race.
*  So why is he doing this and how is he justifying this intervention?
*  So even though Biden's out of the race, he still wants Harris to win.
*  And he's clearly hoping to give Democrats a leg up with this move.
*  And so the means by which he's going to potentially block the deal has to do with this
*  shadowy interagency panel known as CFIUS,
*  which is the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
*  Kind of a mouthful.
*  Yeah, indeed.
*  It's kind of an obscure panel made up of cabinet officials across the government
*  and it's led by the Treasury Department.
*  It reviews foreign acquisitions of sensitive companies, infrastructure,
*  all kinds of things that might potentially pose a threat to the United States.
*  And it has the power to make recommendations to block these transactions.
*  And Alan, what's the implication here?
*  Because of course, Japan is an important ally to the United States,
*  specifically regarding China, which of course is an adversary.
*  So it's very interesting and kind of odd that a Japanese company would be seen as a security threat.
*  Have they actually said anything about what the concerns actually are?
*  Not publicly.
*  The potential national security concerns that they might raise
*  are the idea that Japan or a Japanese company getting a hold of U.S. steel
*  could potentially jeopardize the security of the U.S. steel sector more broadly.
*  And that that's an issue if there was sort of a national emergency crisis
*  and the United States needed steel for various reasons.
*  I think there's also been a more broadly considered view of national security
*  and economic security and how they're defined.
*  And the idea that this could erode the U.S. industrial base if something happens to this company
*  is also something that they might say is a reason to block the deal.
*  So what does U.S. Steel say about all of this?
*  So they've continued to defend the logic of the deal saying that they don't see any national
*  security threats. This is going to be good for workers, good for workers in Pennsylvania,
*  and that Nippon Steel really is the only option for allowing them to continue to invest in
*  Pennsylvania. But they've also been giving some other indications that if it doesn't go through,
*  there could be some repercussions for Pennsylvania steel workers.
*  They've suggested that there could be plant closures, layoffs, and that they might even
*  consider relocating out of the state so they can focus on some of their plants in the south where
*  they don't have to rely on union labor. And so a lot of people in Pennsylvania see this as a threat
*  and they're not happy about the fact that U.S. Steel is raising the specter of leaving if this
*  deal gets blocked. Interesting. A U.S. Steel leaving
*  Pennsylvania would be a really bad thing for the state and for those workers. But how likely is
*  this to happen if Nippon Steel doesn't buy this company? It's hard to know if they're bluffing or
*  not, but I think it is definitely a possibility. I think the company definitely does not like the
*  idea of the federal government interfering with some sort of free market transaction.
*  If it does happen, it most likely would happen after the election. Obviously, the union is not
*  particularly happy, but there's also the possibility that Nippon will live up to their word,
*  make these big investments in Pennsylvania, potentially reopen some of these idle plants
*  in the Midwest, and potentially revive U.S. Steel. And what if it doesn't go through?
*  Well, that'll be the most interesting situation. I think you'll probably see other companies,
*  potentially Cleveland Cliffs or others that made the initial bids for U.S. Steel, try to get back
*  in the game. I think there will be a lot of backlash from different quarters, particularly
*  Japan. We've already heard from some lawmakers in Japan saying it really makes no sense for the
*  United States to move forward and block this deal, and that it's not justified. Other U.S. allies
*  will definitely be raising their eyebrows as well, particularly ones where the United States is often
*  preaching open markets and the necessity of that. I think it'll make it harder for the United States
*  to be able to make that case. But I think it definitely will raise some questions for potential
*  foreign investors who want to invest in Pennsylvania or in other potentially politically sensitive
*  states or sectors, whether or not they should actually move forward with those deals, because
*  they might get blocked. So, Allen, is it possible that this whole move by Biden could just backfire?
*  In his scramble to show that he's all for American ownership and Team USA, he ends up
*  hurting the very workers he's trying to protect and the very swing state he's trying to win?
*  There's definitely that possibility. There's a lot of potential tradeoffs that have to be weighed
*  here and a lot of potential reverberations that could happen depending on what he does and if the
*  deal is blocked. And I think that really puts the Biden administration in a difficult position
*  where they have to weigh the possibility that in trying to help these workers and keep this company
*  American-owned and in Pennsylvania, in the longer term, they may end up costing jobs in the state
*  that they're trying to help. On the other hand, I think the short-term politics are really difficult
*  to resist and those forces are really strong. The idea of giving U.S. Steel away to a Japanese
*  company and letting that happen is something that's really uncomfortable for a lot of people.
*  And I think the potential ramifications of that and the fact that the union and labor,
*  which is so powerful and so important, particularly in election year,
*  is against it, is something that's really hard to avoid.
*  Alan, thank you.
*  Thanks very much.
*  On Wednesday, CEOs of Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel met with representatives from over half a dozen
*  U.S. government agencies in a last-ditch effort to save the $15 billion deal.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. The latest numbers on the economy show inflation
*  is continuing to slow. The consumer price index for the month of August was 2.5 percent,
*  down from 2.9 percent in July, and its lowest level in three and a half years.
*  However, one detail that could give economic officials pause is the fact that the U.S.
*  is still in the middle of a recession. The number of people who are in the middle of a recession
*  is still high. The number of people who are in the middle of a recession is still high.
*  But mainly, the report confirmed that inflation, a key issue for voters,
*  is continuing to cool after surging in 2021 and 2022.
*  It's seen as the final big economic measure before the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates
*  for the first time since early 2020, a move it's expected to make at its meeting next week.
