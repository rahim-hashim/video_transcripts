# Trump 2.0: A Criminal Sentencing, Presidential Legacies, and Greenland
**New York Times - The Daily:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=4.22s)]
*  Today Donald Trump sentencing in the New York hush money case is just two days away and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=11.32s)]
*  he is throwing a Hail Mary in the direction of the US Supreme Court. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=15.96s)]
*  During a busy week, President-elect Trump asked the Supreme Court to prevent him from [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=20.22s)]
*  being sentenced in a New York criminal case. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=25.46s)]
*  There has been international pushback over Trump's recent comments about taking control [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=28.24s)]
*  of Greenland. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=32.72s)]
*  He implied that as president, he could use military force to seize control of Greenland [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=34.0s)]
*  and the Panama Canal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  Less than two weeks before his inauguration, the president-elect is mapping out headline [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  making plans for his administration. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=46.36s)]
*  And he overshadowed a sitting president who is using his final days in office to try to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=49.0s)]
*  Trump-proof his legacy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=55.12s)]
*  To make sense of all of this, I gathered three of my colleagues, senior political reporter [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Maggie Haverman and White House reporters David Sanger and Zolan Kano-Youngs. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=63.54s)]
*  It's Friday, January 10th. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=77.56s)]
*  Friends, welcome to the first Daily Roundtable of 2025. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=88.56s)]
*  And thank you for being here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=94.28s)]
*  Maggie, you are joining us from Washington. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=98.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=99.72s)]
*  David, you are coming to us from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=100.72s)]
*  Nice to have you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=103.8s)]
*  Well, I'm down the street in Palm Beach. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=104.8s)]
*  But yes, we've been in and out of Mar-a-Lago a few times. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=107.28s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=110.8s)]
*  And Zolan, we are talking to you from Italy, where President Biden was supposed to be but [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=111.8s)]
*  had to cancel because of the Los Angeles wildfires. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=116.36s)]
*  Thank you for being on. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=119.32s)]
*  Ciao, ciao, colleagues. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=120.32s)]
*  So we have all the geography covered here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=122.68s)]
*  And as always, we begin with the caveat that we are recording this at a very specific time, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=125.28s)]
*  around 1.15 on Thursday, because the news could change before we run this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=130.0s)]
*  And in fact, we know it will change because the Supreme Court is about to make a major [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=134.76s)]
*  ruling at the request of President-elect Trump. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=139.72s)]
*  Can you walk us through that request from President-elect Trump? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=147.68s)]
*  So President-elect Trump's lawyers filed a request for the Supreme Court to stop Trump's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=148.68s)]
*  scheduled sentencing on felony falsifying business records that related to a payment to a porn [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=154.28s)]
*  star who said she'd had an affair with Trump. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=161.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  We think of this as the hush money case. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  The hush money case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  And the sentencing was scheduled by New York Justice Juan Marchand for January 10th. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=166.56s)]
*  When this runs, Friday morning. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=172.44000000000003s)]
*  Now it's worth bearing in mind, Michael, that part of why this sentencing has not happened [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=173.44000000000003s)]
*  yet is because Trump's legal team has repeatedly requested delays over and over and over again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  And Marchand's feeling is it needs to happen at a certain point for closure and respect [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=181.84s)]
*  for the jury verdict and so forth and so on. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  He has refused their request to dismiss the case outright. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=189.28000000000003s)]
*  The Trump team is not surprisingly using every avenue they can to try to delay it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  What's their strongest argument, Maggie, legally for why the Supreme Court should weigh in [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=198.04s)]
*  and stop this local court case from running its course? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=204.64s)]
*  Legally it's the presidential immunity argument. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=208.64s)]
*  And it's going to be up to the justices to decide whether in their previous ruling about [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=210.64s)]
*  how presidents have pretty broad immunity for acts committed while in office, whether [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=216.52s)]
*  this would technically apply. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=222.16s)]
*  There is the question, and I do think that some of the justices may feel this pull, of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=224.48s)]
*  whether an incoming president should be facing a hearing where even though the judge in the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=229.04s)]
*  case has signaled that he's going to give Trump an unconditional discharge, meaning [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=234.2s)]
*  no penalties, no jail time, no anything, no home confinement, it is onerous to go into [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  office that way. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=243.16s)]
*  And that's not really a legal argument. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  It's more a respect for the presidency argument. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=245.88s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  David, what would it mean for the ruling to go either way, not just for Trump necessarily, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=249.56s)]
*  but for the idea of the rule of law? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=254.96s)]
*  Well, for Trump to begin with, just the concept, as Maggie said, of being inaugurated in roughly [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=257.56s)]
*  10 days as a felon is something that I think he would probably not want to see on his Wikipedia [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=266.44s)]
*  page. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=274.04s)]
*  And it will fit into the entire grievance argument that President-elect Trump has made [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=275.68s)]
*  that these prosecutions have been entirely political. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  And you've heard him make those arguments as recently as earlier this week at his press [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=287.04s)]
*  conference. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  But more importantly, for the institution, it then would raise the fundamental question [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  how somebody could be convicted as a felon, and then quite constitutionally, quite legally [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=302.88s)]
*  elected as president. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=309.2s)]
*  David, you mentioned there was a press conference from President-elect Trump earlier this week [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=311.2s)]
*  made a lot of news. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=316.2s)]
*  And Zolan, you were covering that news conference. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=318.52s)]
*  It was at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=321.2s)]
*  Zolan, just to begin with, what was this news conference supposed to be about? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=322.2s)]
*  On paper, it was almost advertised as something that I think many would characterize as somewhat [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=328.56s)]
*  presidential about economic investment. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=333.44s)]
*  The President-elect came out with a business leader from the UAE that actually has close [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  ties to the Trump family and started out by talking about a $20 billion investment to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=342.82000000000005s)]
*  data centers, a sort of normal press conference as one goes into office. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  It really only took minutes for this thing to move off topic and to devolve into something [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=354.88s)]
*  that was a news conference that I think we all saw when Trump was first in office. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, inevitably, it turned to Greenland. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=366.32s)]
*  And David, you were there, and you ended up asking him a question about his now repeated [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=369.84s)]
*  interest in the idea of the United States basically subsuming Canada, Greenland, and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=379.44s)]
*  the Panama Canal. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=387.76s)]
*  And I want to play, David, for our listeners the question that you asked the President-elect [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=389.24s)]
*  that basically became the exchange heard around the world. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=395.74s)]
*  Here is what it sounded like. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=398.44s)]
*  But let's start, if we could, with your references to Greenland and the Panama Canal. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=400.64s)]
*  Can you assure the world that as you try to get control of these areas, you are not [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=409.16s)]
*  going to use military or economic coercion? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=416.48s)]
*  No. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about what your plan is? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=420.32000000000005s)]
*  Are you going to negotiate a new treaty? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=423.8s)]
*  Are you going to ask the Canadians to hold the vote? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=426.12s)]
*  What is the strategy? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  I can assure you, you're talking about Panama and Greenland. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, I can't assure you on either of those two, but I can say this. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=434.08s)]
*  We need them for economic security. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=439.24s)]
*  The Panama Canal was built... [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=441.84s)]
*  David, just explain what it is Trump is saying. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  He's not saying all that much, but it ends up making a ton of news. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=446.64s)]
*  So when this all began in the first term, Michael, you may recall that one of his close [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=451.68s)]
*  friends had suggested to him that the United States should buy Greenland, an idea that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=458.12s)]
*  actually Harry Truman had had in the 1940s, the opening of the Cold War. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  And in the first term, it was pretty much described as a real estate offer. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=470.0s)]
*  He was making an offer. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=475.32s)]
*  The sellers said they weren't interested in selling and we kind of moved on. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=477.0s)]
*  Denmark has got the foreign and defense responsibilities for Greenland. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=481.68s)]
*  As the president-elect has come back at this in December in a series of tweets and increasingly [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=488.32s)]
*  martial sounding statements, he has made it sound less like a deal and more like you have [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=494.92s)]
*  to go do this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=501.21999999999997s)]
*  And I had been told by people who had had conversations with him or with his advisors [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=503.24s)]
*  that he was increasingly discussing using the other powers of the United States to force [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=509.52s)]
*  Denmark and now Panama to basically make this deal happen. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=516.6s)]
*  In other words, that he would come to it not just as a real estate developer, but a real [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=522.96s)]
*  estate developer who's commander in chief, most powerful, yes, military behind him. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=526.96s)]
*  And so that's why I phrased the question as I did, which was to ask him, are you planning [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=532.0400000000001s)]
*  to use military or economic coercion? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=538.36s)]
*  And as you might expect with Donald Trump, who frequently tells you, as Maggie knows [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=542.36s)]
*  better than I do, sort of what's right on his mind, he immediately said, I'm not going [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=546.5s)]
*  to rule out using any of those tools. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=551.6s)]
*  And that's what made such news. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  Maggie and Zolan, let's take the president-elect at his word here. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=557.96s)]
*  What might it look like to use, let's just use the example of military power, perhaps [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  not to invade, but to begin a campaign of intimidation to try to convince Denmark this [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=567.08s)]
*  is inevitable. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=573.32s)]
*  I can't speak to what a military effort would look like that isn't an invasion. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=575.84s)]
*  In terms of economic pressure, tariffs are Trump's tool of choice and have been over [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=580.6s)]
*  and over again. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=585.2s)]
*  And I was talking to a former Biden administration official about this today who was saying that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=586.88s)]
*  folks in Greenland are alarmed about the tariff threats. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=592.36s)]
*  And there's a sense in Greenland that, as David said, this is different than the discussion [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=595.8s)]
*  in 2019, which was this would be great for us strategically. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=600.4799999999999s)]
*  That's a little different than I want this and I'm going to take it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=604.4s)]
*  And I've been reminding some people in the last couple of days that Trump in the early [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  1980s, when he was making his name as a developer, did things like threaten to move homeless [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=613.52s)]
*  people into a building he had bought to try to get certain tenants out. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=621.7199999999999s)]
*  He did things like paint the homes of people who lived near one of his casinos in Atlantic [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=626.04s)]
*  City because he just didn't like the way they looked without asking their permission. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=631.48s)]
*  Just went and painted their houses. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=635.0s)]
*  And so like this is his mindset and everything is sort of flat and the same and he's treating [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=636.52s)]
*  it that way. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump never rules anything out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=642.64s)]
*  It's straight out of his playbook. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  Economic coercion is straight out of his playbook. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=646.24s)]
*  And it's not just Denmark and Panama, which he focused on in the press conference, leaders [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=648.72s)]
*  there that are rattled by this. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=653.48s)]
*  He also talked about Canada and potentially using economic coercion there. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=655.1600000000001s)]
*  Also the tricky thing with these press conferences is we focus on in one example, Trump said, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=659.44s)]
*  I want to rename the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America, right? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=665.2s)]
*  The focus is there. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=669.0600000000001s)]
*  But also he did have comments about Mexico and the Mexican government not doing enough [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=670.5s)]
*  to stop migrants, to stop drug trafficking. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  We know that he has also threatened tariffs against Mexico before. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=677.74s)]
*  So while there might be sort of a flashy statement at the top of this, I do think there's a real [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=681.34s)]
*  through line behind it. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=686.94s)]
*  And it does, you know, rattle leaders, including some of our biggest trade partners. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=688.44s)]
*  I have a theory I wanted to run by all of you or perhaps just one of you who's willing [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=692.78s)]
*  to take it on about how Trump talks about Greenland, Panama Canal, Canada and what may [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=697.1s)]
*  simply underlie it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=703.86s)]
*  And let's just put aside the argument that there's a strategic economic reason for doing [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=705.82s)]
*  it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=709.6600000000001s)]
*  Perhaps there very much is. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=710.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's controversial to say that at this moment, American sense of themselves [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=711.82s)]
*  is that we're a little bit on our heels. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=715.7s)]
*  We aren't the only superpower in the world anymore. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=717.6600000000001s)]
*  David, you've written books about this. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=719.94s)]
*  Many see us as a nation somewhat in decline from our heights of power. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=722.0600000000001s)]
*  And in that context, my logic has been the idea of expansion, even if it's just an idea, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=725.94s)]
*  is enormously appealing in this moment. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=732.44s)]
*  It's like a return to manifest destiny. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=734.62s)]
*  Westward Ho. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=736.58s)]
*  You know, we have bought states and land in the past. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=737.58s)]
*  We bought Alaska from Russia. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=740.22s)]
*  I looked it up right before this conversation started. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=741.22s)]
*  And so should we just view it in that context? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=743.76s)]
*  It's nationalism on steroids. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=746.3s)]
*  Yes, America went through a phase where from the Louisiana Purchase to Alaska, which was [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=748.14s)]
*  dismissed as, you know, Seward's Folly at the time, right, to the Spanish American War, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=754.78s)]
*  which we got Guam and Puerto Rico and had control of the Philippines for a long time. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=760.6999999999999s)]
*  This was the way the U.S. operated. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=765.98s)]
*  In the post World War II era, we have talked instead about living in a rule of international [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=768.42s)]
*  law where power took a backseat to what our legal rights were. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=776.3399999999999s)]
*  And our fundamental argument as a nation about why the United States is supporting Ukraine [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=782.78s)]
*  is that Vladimir Putin used the fact that he had a more powerful army to go in on a [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=789.14s)]
*  national security argument. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=794.8199999999999s)]
*  You could call it a pretense to invade Ukraine and that, you know, we have moved beyond that. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=796.86s)]
*  That was the core of the Biden argument for why this was an illegal move. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=803.22s)]
*  So any suggestion that the United States was moving back to sort of the law of the jungle [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=809.38s)]
*  is what's got people so, I think, disturbed at this moment. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=814.94s)]
*  I mean, Maggie, let me give you the last word on this before we go to break. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=819.62s)]
*  Is this symbolic or based on your reporting, is this a serious, earnest undertaking that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=822.62s)]
*  we should be watching with the carefulness that goes with the adage that when Trump says [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=828.0200000000001s)]
*  something, take it seriously? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=833.26s)]
*  I think in general, he's the incoming president. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=835.98s)]
*  So I think that after everything we have seen over the last eight years, the whole literally [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=837.94s)]
*  seriously fight seems kind of beside the point to me. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=842.66s)]
*  And settled. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=845.9s)]
*  Yeah, and settled. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=846.9s)]
*  And so he's saying it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=847.9s)]
*  I mean, part of the problem too, Michael, is that Trump sort of everything is a troll [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=848.9s)]
*  until, as Jonathan Swan says, until it suddenly becomes serious. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=853.38s)]
*  We are going to take a break. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=860.86s)]
*  And when we come back, we're going to talk about what the president, the actual sitting [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=861.86s)]
*  president is up to right now. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=864.66s)]
*  It's quite overshadowed by the president-elect and understand how Biden is thinking about [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=866.5s)]
*  his final days in office. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=871.86s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=873.22s)]
*  OK, Zolan, talk about what President Biden is doing in this final stretch of time he [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=880.0200000000001s)]
*  has in office. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=886.4200000000001s)]
*  So I'll start with policy and sort of the actions that he's been taking. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=888.62s)]
*  He recently signed an executive order in the vein of environmental justice and climate. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=894.3000000000001s)]
*  It would basically ban drilling in about six hundred and twenty five million acres [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=899.14s)]
*  of U.S. coastal waters. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=904.14s)]
*  Biden has also used his final days to issue clemency action as well for those on death [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=906.3s)]
*  row. Right. That being said, I do think that there's a focus right now on how the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=911.66s)]
*  sitting president is sort of putting up hurdles in the way for the incoming administration. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=918.54s)]
*  When I talk to administration officials privately, they're honest that they're limited in [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=924.26s)]
*  what they can do with the president-elect coming in. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=929.02s)]
*  You know, Trump has said that he's going to gut Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and his [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=931.86s)]
*  environmental investments. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=936.5s)]
*  He has said he's going to peel back some of that money. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=938.22s)]
*  And there are laws in place that basically say that appropriated funds have to go out. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=940.26s)]
*  But there is not much you can do for, say, Biden's executive actions on immigration. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=945.6999999999999s)]
*  Trump's going to be able to peel much of that back. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=950.62s)]
*  So, yes, Biden is taking action to try to protect some of these policies. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=954.06s)]
*  But privately, administration officials are a little bit more candid about how little [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=959.26s)]
*  they can do here to protect this agenda, particularly that which wasn't signed into [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=964.1s)]
*  legislation. Right. What you're pointing to is that Biden might sign an executive order [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=969.5s)]
*  saying that the grounds under the ocean can't be drilled. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=972.66s)]
*  But the thing about an executive order is that it depends on whose executive Trump could [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=976.74s)]
*  come in and essentially roll that back, which is the case for pretty much all executive [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=981.26s)]
*  action. That's right. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=984.8199999999999s)]
*  David, what stands out to you about these last, I guess, two weeks and days of Biden's [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=986.06s)]
*  presidency? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=993.1s)]
*  Two things. First, on the executive orders, we've still got a couple that are coming and [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=995.3s)]
*  some that will put, I think, President-elect Trump in something of an interesting bind or [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=999.9399999999999s)]
*  at least some interesting choices. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1006.3s)]
*  There is an order coming on artificial intelligence that would basically restrict to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1008.02s)]
*  manufacturing in the United States and keeping in the United States the data centers, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1013.1s)]
*  many of the chips that are used for AI purposes so that China can't use them for military [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1018.34s)]
*  purposes. It's a very nationalistic kind of order. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1024.02s)]
*  It follows what Biden has been doing with the semiconductor industry since the start. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1026.66s)]
*  And it would make President Trump, once he's in office, have to choose between his tech [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1031.58s)]
*  supporters, including the Elon Musk crowd, who want the greatest ability to conduct AI [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1037.94s)]
*  work all around the world and the MAGA group that would say, let's do this here in the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1045.38s)]
*  United States. I think he might stick with that one. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1050.6200000000001s)]
*  So you're saying if Biden can't protect everything he's done, what he can do is drive a [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1053.02s)]
*  wedge between Trump and his supporters and leave him in a pretty tough spot. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1057.26s)]
*  That's right. And between these emerging groups, the tech supporters versus the older line [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1061.54s)]
*  sort of nationalistic MAGA supporters. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1067.26s)]
*  Your broader question. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1070.58s)]
*  You know, what's been remarkable, I think, to all of us has been the degree to which [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1072.14s)]
*  President Biden has seeded the spotlight. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1076.58s)]
*  We've now seen Trump do two major press conferences. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1080.7s)]
*  I don't believe there's been a full press conference with President Biden since the NATO [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1084.46s)]
*  summit last summer, just before he dropped out of the race. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1089.66s)]
*  David, I traveled with him to Latin America and Angola, and he answered two shouted [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1094.3s)]
*  questions during both of those trips and two shouted questions. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1100.66s)]
*  And this is the old trope. Journalists really like it when their presidents hold news [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1106.26s)]
*  conferences. But I'm hearing you all say this is not just journalistic bellyaching about [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1109.38s)]
*  access to the president. This is about what seems like either a conscious or unconscious [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1112.94s)]
*  decision by the president to not hold the office in the fullest way possible publicly [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1116.42s)]
*  as he could at the end of his presidency. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1122.5s)]
*  That's right. And he did one interview with USA Today. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1124.5s)]
*  You know where I'm going, David. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1127.86s)]
*  In that, I'll be interested to see what Zola and Maggie thought. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1130.18s)]
*  I didn't think that he used the moment to sort of put his presidency in the scale of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1134.1s)]
*  history. Well, let's talk about what he did do in that interview. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1140.9s)]
*  I mean, the elements of the interview with USA Today that ultimately seemed to [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1143.34s)]
*  break through were the fact that Biden, among other things, is considering issuing [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1149.34s)]
*  preemptive pardons that would protect potential targets of a criminal investigation by [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1154.8999999999999s)]
*  the incoming Trump administration. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1160.18s)]
*  We've talked so much on the show about a Trump DOJ's pretty much open commitment to [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1161.54s)]
*  going after certain of his rivals and enemies. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1166.74s)]
*  It was interesting that Biden came out and said, I am thinking about doing this. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1170.26s)]
*  Do we know who might be at the top of that list for preemptive pardons? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1172.98s)]
*  And do they want them? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1178.34s)]
*  Because getting a preemptive pardon from the president suggests that you might have [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1179.74s)]
*  done something wrong. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1183.5s)]
*  Yeah. This has been a huge subject within the White House and on Capitol Hill. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1185.02s)]
*  And it really did, as I understand it, originate from Capitol Hill. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1189.26s)]
*  There are a lot of members of Congress who are concerned that the way he often frames [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1193.54s)]
*  it is this person should be investigated. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1198.86s)]
*  Now, I just want to point out, because Trump's people often do, he told me at the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1201.82s)]
*  press that he wasn't going to direct the DOJ on what to do. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1205.5s)]
*  And maybe that will be true. Maybe it won't be true. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1209.06s)]
*  But it almost doesn't need to be true because they know what he wants and they know [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1210.7s)]
*  what he'd like to see done. So these folks are worried about being targeted for [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1213.42s)]
*  trying to hold Trump accountable for things like trying to stay in office after losing [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1218.86s)]
*  an election or... [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1222.98s)]
*  You're talking about Liz Cheney. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1224.14s)]
*  Liz Cheney, for instance, or Benny Thompson, who co-chaired the J-6 committee with her, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1225.38s)]
*  or Anthony Fauci, who is a top infectious diseases official in government for [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1229.78s)]
*  decades who... [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1234.66s)]
*  Including during the Trump administration. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1235.8200000000002s)]
*  And incurred a lot of anger for his coronavirus era recommendations. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1237.42s)]
*  People can take issue with some of the recommendations without suggesting he somehow [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1241.66s)]
*  committed a crime. And that's where that leap goes. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1245.42s)]
*  But if you accept a pardon, you are acknowledging some level of wrongdoing. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1248.5800000000002s)]
*  And these folks generally don't believe they did anything wrong. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1252.3000000000002s)]
*  Number one. Number two, the challenge for the Biden White House is where is the line? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1255.3000000000002s)]
*  Where do you stop? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1259.8600000000001s)]
*  Biden also made a fascinating admission in this conversation with USA Today. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1261.3000000000002s)]
*  And it was this. Although he believes he could have beaten Trump had he stayed in the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1265.8600000000001s)]
*  race, which we'll never really know the answer to, he said he's unsure. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1269.9s)]
*  He acknowledged an uncertainty that he would have made it through a second term. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1273.42s)]
*  That's a big thing to acknowledge, Zolan. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1278.5s)]
*  I thought that was his most clear acknowledgement of what many Democrats had been [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1281.6200000000001s)]
*  fearing. You know, one thing I would often hear is it's not necessarily that he's 82 [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1287.94s)]
*  years old. It's what happens when he's 86. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1293.5s)]
*  What happens at the end of a second term? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1296.5s)]
*  And does he have the ability to fully carry out that service? [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1298.3400000000001s)]
*  And here you saw him acknowledging that concern as well. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1301.6200000000001s)]
*  I also think he was speaking to... [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1305.02s)]
*  We've been reporting a lot on just Biden's sort of mood and his mindset in these final [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1306.5s)]
*  months. And there's been frustration. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1311.3000000000002s)]
*  He does believe that he had the ability to beat Trump if he had stayed at the top of [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1314.1399999999999s)]
*  the ticket. He's also very reflective right now. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1318.6999999999998s)]
*  And I think the USA Today interview showed that. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1321.5s)]
*  He's in this period where he's reflecting on his long career, but also thinking about [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1324.6599999999999s)]
*  what could have been if he hadn't dropped out. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1329.06s)]
*  But to be clear, I mean, most polling does throw doubt on the fact that he had the [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1331.82s)]
*  ability to beat Trump. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1336.3s)]
*  Can I just make one point real quick, Michael, in terms of what Zolan is saying? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1338.1s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1340.74s)]
*  He is reflecting, but he's reflecting on what he believes he was denied. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1341.78s)]
*  He's not reflecting on mistakes that he made or how the White House handled questions [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1345.26s)]
*  about his age or the fact that large numbers of reporters were attacked on social [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1349.74s)]
*  media and elsewhere for raising questions that were taking place in front of their [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1355.82s)]
*  eyes. Right. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1360.26s)]
*  About his age and ability. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1361.26s)]
*  Right. And to deliver the statement of, yes, I could have won, but who knows if I [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1362.26s)]
*  can't say for sure if I could have served the whole four years. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1367.22s)]
*  That's a pretty astonishing statement. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1370.78s)]
*  David, is that an admission of irresponsibility on Biden's part? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1373.02s)]
*  You've covered this presidency for its entirety to suggest that you might not be [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1375.98s)]
*  able to fulfill the obligations of President of the United States Commander in [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1380.5s)]
*  Chief for a full term, but that you were determined to do it anyway. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1383.34s)]
*  It borders on raising serious questions about judgment. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1387.6200000000001s)]
*  It sure does, Michael, because it raises the question, when, Mr. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1391.74s)]
*  President, did you come to that conclusion? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1395.98s)]
*  Right. Before or after you decided not to run. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1398.54s)]
*  Right. At that last press conference that I mentioned, the NATO press conference, I [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1401.42s)]
*  asked him whether or not he thought that he could take on a sit down meeting with [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1406.1s)]
*  Putin or Xi in two or three years. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1411.5s)]
*  And he basically said, absolutely. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1415.78s)]
*  That was July. Right. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1417.46s)]
*  OK. That he definitely could go do that. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1418.66s)]
*  And what are we hearing from him now? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1421.98s)]
*  Well, no one can predict what I'm going to be like when I'm approaching 86. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1423.98s)]
*  Well, that's true of everybody, you know, in that age group. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1429.58s)]
*  Right. And I hope that all of us in this conversation get to the point where we have [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1432.82s)]
*  to go make that decision ourselves. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1437.34s)]
*  But I'd love to know when he came to this conclusion. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1439.98s)]
*  David, this does remind me that you are basically the Forrest Gump of presidential [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1444.42s)]
*  news conferences. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1447.98s)]
*  Totally true. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1449.98s)]
*  Which news conference did you not ask the question? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1450.98s)]
*  It's totally true. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1453.42s)]
*  I want to end my friends on a scene that has just played out a somber one in Washington [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1454.46s)]
*  at the National Cathedral. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1461.22s)]
*  Biden was there. So was Donald Trump and all of our living former presidents. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1462.78s)]
*  This was the funeral, of course, of former President Jimmy Carter. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1467.42s)]
*  I'm curious what stood out to all of you about the ceremony. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1470.66s)]
*  I know you're busy. You might have been able to watch the funeral in its entirety, but [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1474.46s)]
*  there were several moments that I think a number of our colleagues are seizing on for [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1478.5s)]
*  their symbolism and their significance. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1483.38s)]
*  I didn't get to hear most of the eulogies, Michael, but from what I saw visually, what [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1486.02s)]
*  was striking was Mike Pence sitting almost directly behind Donald Trump and they shook [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1491.26s)]
*  hands at one point. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1495.78s)]
*  I don't think they have seen each other in person since they left office. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1497.26s)]
*  January 6th might have spelled Mike Pence's death at the hands of people rioting in the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1501.94s)]
*  name of Donald Trump. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1506.78s)]
*  He rose to shake Trump's hand and Trump has since said, well, those people were angry, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1507.82s)]
*  you know, the mob at the Capitol of his supporters in explaining somewhat justifying why [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1511.94s)]
*  they would be saying such things. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1516.74s)]
*  The other thing that really struck me was just this what looked like moments of levity. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1518.54s)]
*  I don't know if it was pretend or not between President Obama and President Trump, who [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1523.1s)]
*  were sitting next to each other. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1527.26s)]
*  I noticed those as well. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1528.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, these are two men who, the one who was about to be president for a second time, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1528.94s)]
*  rose to prominence in the Republican Party by questioning the legitimacy of the former [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1534.7s)]
*  president. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1540.38s)]
*  Was he American? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1541.14s)]
*  Was he born in the United States? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1541.9s)]
*  Was it right? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1542.7s)]
*  Was he truly born in the U.S.? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1543.22s)]
*  It was really striking, especially because Obama was quite pointed about Donald Trump [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1545.5s)]
*  during this last campaign in a way that he generally hadn't been. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1551.02s)]
*  We're going to slide in and out of sort of Washington routine and normalcy at certain [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1554.7s)]
*  points. And then there's going to be how Trump does things that is not how things have [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1561.26s)]
*  usually been done. And today was just a stark reminder of that. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1565.78s)]
*  That was the most striking thing for me. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1568.34s)]
*  Maggie is just seeing not just Obama, but also Biden and really all of these leaders [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1570.3s)]
*  sitting together, you know, in a way you have a collision of institutionalists and [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1576.02s)]
*  traditionalists facing somebody that for years they have called a threat to democracy [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1582.06s)]
*  and who many of their also supporters believe is a threat to democracy. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1588.02s)]
*  But now you're in this period where your commitment to the institution rises above it [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1592.66s)]
*  seems. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1597.8999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1598.46s)]
*  David, I want to end with a clip of President Biden's eulogy to Jimmy Carter. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1599.62s)]
*  I think by the time we're done playing it, you'll understand why I chose it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1605.86s)]
*  Let me just play it for you. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1609.42s)]
*  You know, we have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor and to stand up to what my [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1610.9s)]
*  dad just says the greatest sin of all, the abuse of power. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1621.26s)]
*  Was that what I think it was? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1626.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that was exactly what you thought it was. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1629.02s)]
*  Just translate that. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1630.98s)]
*  You know, so the eulogy was about Jimmy Carter, but it was about Jimmy Carter as the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1632.3400000000001s)]
*  anti-Trump. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1639.7s)]
*  And I think that is what Biden truly believes. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1641.1000000000001s)]
*  And so you had this odd duality as I was watching it and it struck me, Michael, not [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1644.7s)]
*  to follow your Forrest Gump comparisons for too long because I'm not sure I really like [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1650.94s)]
*  that one very much. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1655.94s)]
*  But these are the five presidents I've covered. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1657.26s)]
*  And these are five remarkably different people. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1659.8200000000002s)]
*  But four of them worked within the institutions, even though we had our doubts at various [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1663.66s)]
*  moments during the Iraq War about George W. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1670.3400000000001s)]
*  Bush. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1673.0600000000002s)]
*  And one of them has celebrated living outside the institution. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1674.26s)]
*  And one way you could look at the five people who were standing there was to say this [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1678.3400000000001s)]
*  moment too shall pass. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1682.5s)]
*  We've had good presidents, bad presidents, presidents who broke laws, presidents who [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1684.06s)]
*  didn't break laws. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1690.22s)]
*  Sure, a lot of people looked at this and looked at Bill Clinton and said, here is an [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1691.42s)]
*  impeached president standing here. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1695.34s)]
*  And there was one at the other end of the bench as well. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1697.82s)]
*  But the other way to go look at it is that that eulogy basically was a warning that [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1700.34s)]
*  while we have made it through each one of these five presidencies represented on those [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1708.78s)]
*  benches and Jimmy Carter's, that there remains a threat to the institution. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1713.82s)]
*  And I think that's what Biden was saying without ever, of course, uttering Donald [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1720.62s)]
*  Trump's name. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1727.02s)]
*  Well, Maggie and Zolan and David, thank you very much for your time. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1737.22s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1742.3799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1743.1799999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1743.42s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1744.0600000000002s)]
*  On Thursday night, the Supreme Court denied Trump's request to stop his criminal [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1752.26s)]
*  sentencing in the New York City hush money case. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1757.7s)]
*  The decision all but ensures that Trump's sentencing will proceed as planned later [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1761.3400000000001s)]
*  today. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1766.74s)]
*  The justices noted that Trump faces no jail time and can still appeal his conviction [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1768.06s)]
*  through traditional legal means. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1774.74s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1783.58s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1798.22s)]
*  It is safe to say that the Palisades fire is one of the most destructive natural [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1801.22s)]
*  disasters in the history of Los Angeles. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1807.74s)]
*  On Thursday, officials in Los Angeles said that the largest of the city's five [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1811.02s)]
*  wildfires, the Palisades fire, has now damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings and [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1815.8600000000001s)]
*  continues to burn out of control. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1822.5s)]
*  In a worrying sign for firefighters, forecasters expected winds to pick up on [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1825.1399999999999s)]
*  Thursday night with wind speeds of 20 to 30 miles per hour and gusts of up to 60 [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1830.78s)]
*  miles per hour and warned that heavy winds could arrive again over the weekend. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1836.86s)]
*  So far, the fires have killed at least five people, but that number is expected to [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1842.5s)]
*  rise. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1848.62s)]
*  And during his state funeral on Thursday, former president Jimmy Carter was [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1850.1s)]
*  remembered as a humble peanut farm who rose to the heights of power. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1856.3799999999999s)]
*  Despite earlier Communist claims, hisdriver retires just Claude Kl chopping [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1862.3s)]
*  wood over farmers, toward the end of his life-long highways- such sons of [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1868.8999999999999s)]
*  women who have been charred by displacement and cargo purchase. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1875.6799999999998s)]
*  and used that power to seek out justice and peace. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1879.1s)]
*  It was something of a miracle. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1884.1s)]
*  And I don't mean this with any disrespect, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1888.1s)]
*  but it's hard for me to understand [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1892.1s)]
*  how you could get to be president from Plains, Georgia. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1896.1s)]
*  In eulogy after eulogy, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1904.1s)]
*  friends, advisors, and Carter's grandson, Jason Carter, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1906.1s)]
*  recalled just how much the former president and his late wife Rosalynn [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1911.1s)]
*  had embraced a life of modesty. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1917.1s)]
*  Yes, they spent four years in the governor's mansion [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1921.1s)]
*  and four years at the White House, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1925.1s)]
*  but the other 92 years they spent at home in Plains, Georgia. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1927.1s)]
*  And one of the best ways to demonstrate that they were regular folks [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1933.1s)]
*  is to take them by that home. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1937.1s)]
*  First of all, it looks like they might have built it themselves. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1939.1s)]
*  Second of all, my grandfather was likely to show up at the door [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1945.1s)]
*  in some 70s short shorts and Crocs. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1949.1s)]
*  After the funeral, Carter's body was flown by military jet [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1954.1s)]
*  to his hometown in Georgia for a private service at his local church [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1959.1s)]
*  and a burial at a family plot next to his home. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaXKEALXgis&t=1964.1s)]
