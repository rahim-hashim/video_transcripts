# 'The Interview' Joel Embiid Believes He Could Have Been the GOAT
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjEmF7Qi5cM)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview.
*  I'm David Marchese.
*  When the Olympics kick off in Paris next week, the Americans will be the overwhelming favorite
*  for the men's basketball gold, like always.
*  And this year, central to that team is Philadelphia 76ers star JoÃ«l Embiid.
*  Embiid is one of basketball's best players, but he also seems weirdly cursed.
*  I think of him almost as a kind of NBA Sisyphus, because for all his individual success, and
*  that includes an MVP award and back-to-back scoring titles, he's never won a championship.
*  The Sixers have repeatedly fallen short in the playoffs, at times in almost comically
*  heartbreaking fashion.
*  I'm talking literally due to a couple unlucky bounces here and there.
*  And then there's the turnover.
*  The team has seen coaches, star players, and general managers come and then go.
*  And Embiid himself keeps getting hurt.
*  That combination of iffy management and bad luck have cast the shadow of unfulfilled potential
*  over Embiid's decade-long career.
*  So in some ways, the Olympics are a chance for a bit of redemption.
*  But the path to Paris hasn't been smooth either, starting with the question of which country
*  to play for.
*  Embiid is a citizen of the U.S., France, and Cameroon.
*  And as he told me, for him, the decision of which jersey to put on wound up being both
*  personal and political.
*  Here's my conversation with Joel Embiid.
*  Can you talk to me a little bit about what it means for you to be playing for the United States?
*  It means a lot.
*  I mean, I spent half of my life here already.
*  You know, if you look at it, I'm going to spend more time here than I have in my home
*  country.
*  I've got a great family, great wife, great people around, you know, my son.
*  So it just made a lot of sense.
*  And I just felt like having built a lot over here and having that opportunity to achieve
*  the dream that I've had since growing up, I really appreciated that.
*  Not to draw too many comparisons between you and me, because I don't think there are that
*  many comparisons between you and me, but I'm from Canada originally, and I have dual citizenship,
*  Canadian and US, you know, and I have now been in the United States for 19 years.
*  So soon I'll have lived in America for longer than I was in Canada, you know.
*  And it's clear to me that for whatever reason, I will never self identify as American, even
*  though I have built my family here.
*  My wife is American.
*  My kids are American.
*  Do you have similar feelings?
*  Like when you think of Joel Embiid, do you think of yourself as American?
*  No, I think I was myself as from Cameroon, you know, I was always going to be home.
*  I was born there.
*  And what I've seen growing up, the struggle, I always identify, you know, with it because
*  I think that's also one of the reasons why I ended up the way I am.
*  And I ended up succeeding because of the environment I was raised in.
*  Nothing was ever comfortable.
*  I always felt like I got to work for everything.
*  And that's probably one of the reasons that kind of helped me.
*  You know, I started playing basketball at 16.
*  So like it's hard to make it, you know, when you start that old and especially because
*  guys have been playing their whole life in America.
*  So if I didn't kind of live through it growing up, I don't think I would have made it.
*  A lot of people thought you were going to play for the French men's basketball team
*  at this year's Olympics.
*  You ultimately decided to play for the American men's team.
*  Can you tell me how you wound up making that decision?
*  It was tough.
*  Obviously, I got my home country, Cameroon, which I love, and the U.S. where I've been
*  for I think it's 14 years now.
*  And then obviously France, where I have a lot of family and I've been to France, you
*  know, a lot of times.
*  So it was tough.
*  But my goal growing up, I watched the Olympics.
*  It was always about, you know, I want to play, I want to be part of it.
*  So that's been my dream.
*  So to me, that was what matters the most, you know, achieving my dreams.
*  And you know, one thing I said, I kind of felt rushed in that decision because I wanted
*  to take as much time as possible.
*  And it didn't help that, you know, France put an ultimatum on when the decision had
*  to be made.
*  They set a timeline.
*  So what was the timeline?
*  I didn't know.
*  You know, I saw it on Twitter and I was like, whoa, you know, where did this come from?
*  Because I mean, from the conversation that I had with the U.S. was, you know, just take
*  as much time as you need.
*  You know, there's no rush.
*  You know, we'd love to have you, but it's okay.
*  You know, if you make another decision, then when you got someone else putting the pressure
*  on you, making it seem like, oh, you got to make the decision.
*  But then again, one thing that was always known was that Cameroon is the first choice.
*  And if there's the qualified, I'm playing for my home country because that's my dream
*  to play in the Olympics.
*  And you know, I had the opportunity to talk to the French president about what was going
*  on.
*  I told him, I mean, one thing that was kind of bothering me a lot was the relationship
*  between France and Cameroon and African countries in general.
*  Yeah, historically.
*  And even right now, like, you know, like there's a lot of things going on over there where
*  there's a lot of pushback as far as, you know, basically kicking out the French because it's
*  been so many years of oppression.
*  And so that was my mindset because I just knew it would be hard.
*  Like I still got my family living in Cameroon and I don't want to put them through any of
*  that stuff.
*  You know, I want them to be safe.
*  And you know, the relationship between France and Cameroon or Africa in general is just not good.
*  You said you spoke to the president about this?
*  You mean Macron?
*  Yeah, Macron.
*  You know, no disrespect.
*  I would hope he has more important things to do than try to convince basketball players
*  to come play for the French team.
*  But what did you say to him and what did he say back to you?
*  Nah, man, it was a nice conversation.
*  You know, I got a call and at first I usually don't answer random numbers and then I got
*  a text and I figure out what was happening.
*  It was a nice conversation.
*  It was great.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, sort of a tangential question, but when you just mentioned that you started playing
*  basketball at 16, I don't know how much you're aware of how crazy American parents are about
*  sports and their kids.
*  There really is a lot of pressure, I think, on kids to pick a sport very early.
*  You know, and there's the idea that if your kid hasn't identified his or her sport by
*  the time they're 12 years old, they're never going to be a professional at that sport or
*  make it to the next level.
*  So do you think the emphasis on starting kids super early in sports is misguided or is it
*  more likely that you're just, you know, sort of an athletic super talent and you were able
*  to make it work?
*  I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to it.
*  Obviously it's a little different for me because it worked.
*  So yeah, to answer your question, I mean, I got a son now.
*  To me, first of all, I don't want to push him to play sports.
*  He's going to do whatever he wants.
*  If he start liking it, sure, but if he doesn't and he's not interested in it, there's no
*  point.
*  He's going to do it.
*  Your son is what, two?
*  Three.
*  So you have some time to worry about that.
*  I'm going to school like, you know, he's all about letting them make their own choices
*  and you know, so he's going to figure that.
*  But the thing that I know is that if you want to play sports, it doesn't necessarily have
*  to start playing basketball at that age or that young because growing up, that's what
*  I did.
*  I played every sport.
*  So that probably prepared me for when I did start playing basketball at 16.
*  I wasn't ready, but I had the footwork and I had some of the fundamentals.
*  Are there ways in which having a son has changed how you think about your job?
*  Yeah, it changed everything.
*  We had him in 2020 and before that I was not a serious human being.
*  I was always joking around.
*  I was always saying whatever.
*  I was always acting crazy.
*  That was the golden days of my Twitter era.
*  Yeah, you famously were a very good Twitter troll among other things.
*  Yeah, basically.
*  And then once I found out that I was having a kid and then I was like, yeah, I got to
*  set a better example.
*  I can't just be on Twitter just trolling and that can't be my life.
*  And yeah, that basically changed everything.
*  The way I started thinking, you know, my focus on basketball changed.
*  Not that I wasn't taken seriously before, but I even took it to another level.
*  Explain to me why having a child made you take it to a next level.
*  Because I think, you know, for some people, the thought process might be like, hey, I
*  have a kid now.
*  I realized like maybe basketball is not the most important thing.
*  It was all about setting a good example.
*  I think he came from my dad growing up.
*  He was a handball player and really good too.
*  And he was also in the army.
*  So I was always going through all these games and just watching him competing and succeeding.
*  That was kind of like the bar for me.
*  And I always told myself that I want to be better than him.
*  So if that was the bar, I was like, I got to achieve more.
*  And I don't want to put that pressure on my son.
*  If that's the way he wants to look at life, then if the bar is winning all these things,
*  then he has to be the greatest player ever.
*  Which at least, I think to me, it's all about help.
*  If I was healthy and all this season, that would be a different conversation.
*  But
*  Is the implication that you think you would be in the greatest player of all time conversation
*  without the injury problems?
*  I think so.
*  I think I'm that talented.
*  I didn't stop believing it probably until I was in my fourth or fifth year in the league
*  where I had the opportunity to accomplish something special.
*  And for that, obviously you need to win championships.
*  And to win championships, you need other guys.
*  You need help.
*  You can't do it by yourself.
*  It's just impossible.
*  So that's why I want to win so bad.
*  But then again, if you don't, you just got to understand as long as you worry about the
*  right stuff.
*  And if it doesn't happen, then I guess maybe it wasn't meant to happen.
*  So yeah, I kind of forgot the question.
*  So I got lost.
*  It was a question.
*  But you answered it.
*  The question was about whether or not you feel like you were on a greatest of all time
*  trajectory.
*  Yeah.
*  The thing that has stopped me all these years is just freak injuries.
*  Every single playoffs, regular season, people falling on my knee.
*  Someone breaking my face twice.
*  It was always about freak injuries at the wrong time.
*  I really believe that because I would have been, if I was more healthy, I think it would
*  have been a different story.
*  Yeah.
*  What is the psychology of having to come back from injuries over and over again?
*  Because I think most of us can relate to wanting to achieve something and working hard toward
*  achieving something and then through circumstances beyond our control, in your case injuries,
*  not being able to achieve that thing.
*  So how have you learned to not get discouraged?
*  Going back to I was raised and where I came from.
*  It's always about pushing, wanting to be better for yourself.
*  There's only one injury that I've had that kind of put me, it was this pasture where
*  mentally and physically I just, that's the first one that it was tough.
*  But every other one was always about, okay, it happens.
*  What am I supposed to do about it?
*  It's life.
*  And then this pasture was-
*  Yeah, why was that different?
*  I don't know, just mentally, physically, because I was, you're playing your best basketball
*  of your career and it's just becoming so easy every single night.
*  You're winning games and dropping 40, 50, 60.
*  Like you just-
*  70, didn't you have a 70 point game?
*  Yeah, you finally got to figure it out.
*  You just become, you know what to do.
*  You have an answer for everything that's presented to you on the floor.
*  Double, triple teams, you just know where to go.
*  The system is in place and the guys, everybody's doing their job and then you're on your way
*  to accomplish a lot of good things and then just like that, something happens.
*  Someone falls on your knee again.
*  For this one, I don't know.
*  I don't have any explanation to why it was so tough, but it just was mentally depressing
*  physically, your body not responding the way it should.
*  So how did you deal with that when you were depressed and your body wasn't responding?
*  Same mindset, get back to it, walk as hard as possible, not let anybody see any weaknesses
*  and act like everything is great and hopefully you snap out of it.
*  You've been there in Philly about 10 years.
*  I might get the numbers a little wrong, but I think you had three coaches in that time.
*  There's been front office turnover, other superstar players have come and gone,
*  James Harden, Jimmy Butler.
*  Do you find yourself ever having questions about in the long term whether Philly is the
*  place where you can win a championship?
*  Because there has been that sort of tumultuousness with the franchise since you've been there.
*  Yeah, I'm sure I ask myself questions if you care about the right things and you care about
*  winning and it hasn't happened, which I'm probably at fault too.
*  Why would you be at fault?
*  Because I'm in injuries.
*  I don't perform at the level that I should.
*  But then again, if you want to win, the thing that I always talked about is stability, continuity.
*  I actually have three coaches based on what I've seen.
*  It's not too bad, but still three coaches, three different systems.
*  And even within those coaches, every single year is something different.
*  And then the players, every single year is like new co-star, new players.
*  And when you start looking at teams like that one, whether it's Golden State, Boston this
*  year, Denver last year, those guys have been together for a long time.
*  And then they just added a few other pieces that were able to take them over the top.
*  So you start thinking about, I mean, you go through the years, the Jimmy year, we had
*  pretty good team.
*  And then we end up losing on a game, winning buzzer beta against the eventual champions.
*  Famously Kawhi Leonard, game seven, the ball bounced around the rim and went through.
*  Yep, Toronto.
*  And the way I look at it is like, you got so close.
*  Like, and instead of like, what can we do to make the team better, but also having the
*  same core change the whole team.
*  No continuity.
*  No continuity.
*  You mentioned that game seven against Toronto, I think it was 2019.
*  After that game on the court, you were crying.
*  And I think for some people who were watching, that was an endearing moment.
*  It showed how much you cared.
*  And probably for some other people, maybe they thought, we don't want to see athletes
*  crying on the court.
*  For the whole Twitter war, that was a fun moment for them.
*  They enjoyed that.
*  Why?
*  What were they saying on Twitter?
*  No, I don't know.
*  I'm just, yeah, because I said-
*  You know what they are saying.
*  Don't say you don't know.
*  To this day, I still see the video in the mirror.
*  You know, they make fun of it.
*  I just look at it.
*  For some people, they just saw it as a way to kind of make fun of you.
*  But I just care.
*  Like, you just see, you know, it hurts losing.
*  My question was whether or not that moment or that game was sort of a turning point for
*  your demeanor on the court.
*  Because I think leading up to that, you sort of had a more playful attitude on the court,
*  you know, it sort of embraced the showmanship aspect a little bit more.
*  And then after, it seemed like you were sort of more, just more serious on the court.
*  2020 was probably my worst year in the NBA.
*  I just wasn't having fun because going back to continuity, like, we got rid of Jimmy,
*  JJ, and basically started over.
*  I'm just like, why?
*  Like, that just doesn't make sense.
*  And then the following year, we're just struggling.
*  We're not as good as we should be.
*  And the whole year, I'm just like, I don't want to play basketball.
*  I played that whole year.
*  I'm like, I didn't care.
*  It was just depressing.
*  Like, I just wasn't there.
*  But it did change, you know, because before that, I used to interact with the fans and,
*  you know, always be, you know, laughing.
*  And from then, I just became more serious.
*  And I think a lot of people in Philadelphia, they think I don't care.
*  And I don't, you know, care about basketball or because I'm not doing what they used to.
*  Or, you know, I'm not having fun.
*  No, I'm still having fun.
*  But I'm just so focused.
*  I don't have the energy to just be interacting with it.
*  I'm just trying to do the job.
*  I'm just different.
*  I'm more serious.
*  I'm more mature.
*  And I don't need to be doing that all the time.
*  So yeah, there's a lot to think about.
*  But, you know, I love Philly.
*  I've been here, you know, for 10 years.
*  And he's looking like he's going to be here for a long time.
*  And I actually have an opportunity to finish my career here if they let me, if they want to.
*  What's the best cheesesteak in the city?
*  I don't eat cheesesteaks.
*  You don't eat cheesesteaks?
*  You want to know the answer?
*  This is the news item from this interview.
*  The best cheesesteak is Subway cheesesteak.
*  Subway cheesesteak?
*  Everybody in Philadelphia who is dead is rolling over in their grave.
*  Tony Lutz, Pat's, Gino's.
*  I don't eat cheesesteaks.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I'm not even from Philadelphia.
*  I'm shocked that you think the best cheesesteak is from Subway.
*  It's an abomination.
*  And so your dad was a colonel in the military.
*  And I assume pretty strict.
*  And my understanding too is that you have a fairly disciplined personal life.
*  You don't drink and do other stuff.
*  Is it ever hard to fit into the culture of the league, you know,
*  when you're playing with a guy like James Harden who's a famous partier,
*  you know, and you have the lifestyle that you have?
*  Is there ever temptation?
*  No, there's never any temptation.
*  You know, I don't drink, I don't smoke, never in my life.
*  So you might be around it, but I've never been like,
*  I want to try it.
*  To me, that's actually disgusting.
*  Like I hate the smell.
*  Like I just can't stand it.
*  And it's probably because of the way I was raised.
*  But then again, like to me, the way I look at life,
*  it always goes both ways because it was a strict environment where I was raised.
*  But then again, some people also tend to go the other way.
*  And because it was so strict and they decide to be wild,
*  because they weren't given that opportunity growing up.
*  And just sort of in terms of how you grew up and how you developed as a person,
*  this is sort of a more serious approach at this topic than what we were just talking about.
*  But you lost your younger brother when he was 13, maybe you were 20 or so.
*  How did that experience affect your thinking about life and what you want from life moving forward?
*  It changed a lot.
*  Losing someone that young and someone that's so close to you that young,
*  especially because I wasn't around.
*  I hadn't gone back to Cameroon since I got to the States.
*  So I hadn't really seen him in a long time.
*  So yeah, I mean, it was tough just going through it from my family, my parents,
*  my mom to this day.
*  All of us to this day, but especially for my mom,
*  it still seemed pretty recent and pretty tough.
*  But did it change your priorities?
*  Yeah. Yeah, I mean, family is really important.
*  So yeah, it made me not want to have three kids, maybe want to have four,
*  because there was three of us and I don't like that number three.
*  I was actually drafted number three, but I don't like number three
*  because there was only two of us left.
*  So I told my wife, I'm like, you better have four kids at least,
*  because with that two is too little and three is not.
*  I don't like that.
*  And then just in life, just cherishing and just including family more
*  in everything that's being done.
*  It's also one of those things where it exposes the great lie of sports,
*  where I think we all operate under this idea that it's life and death,
*  and it's not.
*  It's not.
*  That's why I always tell people, even when it comes to winning,
*  everybody always asks me, like, how would you feel if you won a championship?
*  I'm like, if it happens, it'd be great.
*  I feel great.
*  I'm going to enjoy it to the fullest and you never going to hear the end of it.
*  But then again, if it just doesn't happen,
*  what do you want me to do after I retire?
*  Cry about it?
*  No, just move on.
*  Live life because life is bigger than basketball.
*  After the break, more from Embiid on the Olympics,
*  and why he thinks the gold medal for Team USA is far from guaranteed.
*  The talent that's on the US team, you also got to understand,
*  most of those guys are also older.
*  Like LeBron now is not.
*  LeBron now was a couple of years ago.
*  Hi, Joel.
*  How are you?
*  Good, how are you doing?
*  Good. Where are you right now?
*  It's sort of a little echoey.
*  Are you in like your home office or something or where you speak from?
*  Yeah, I'm in the office.
*  Just in talking to you, you're so obviously a thoughtful guy and unassuming,
*  and you have a gentle demeanor about you.
*  But then on the court sometimes, there's sort of a rough quality to you,
*  drawing fouls.
*  I know you're not going to want to hear me say this,
*  but there's some flopping that happens or maybe taking some highly questionable fouls.
*  It makes me wonder about whether or not you feel like you have to become a different person
*  when you're on the court from who you are normally.
*  No, I think it's still the same because everything that I do in life, I can't be.
*  I'm just a competitor, so I want to win in everything that I do.
*  Do you let your kid beat you at stuff?
*  No. We do play basketball sometimes and it hits when I block him.
*  You block a three-year-old?
*  Got to learn while they're so young, so yeah, got to learn.
*  You had talked about feeling more depressed this past season about being injured and how
*  it was more of a mental challenge than it had been previously.
*  Given your background, growing up in a military family, a strict family,
*  as well as the pressures that I think that athletes in particular
*  have to not show vulnerability or to admit weakness,
*  did that make it hard for you to come to the realization that you were depressed?
*  I still don't know what depression is, but to this day, yeah, I imagine, yeah,
*  felt like I was depressed, but I'll never tell you that I was actually going through
*  depression. I don't know what that feels like, but maybe based on some of the symptoms and
*  the way I was feeling, that might make a little sense. I always saw, I believe in,
*  how can I say this? I believe in mental health, but I've never been one to admit that
*  I might be going through something like that. Like you said, the background, where I'm from,
*  so it's kind of hard to admit that something is going on and that you need to be open about it.
*  Do you feel like you can admit it now?
*  No.
*  Right. And you played with JJ Reddick, of course. What do you think about him taking the Lakers
*  coaching job with no prior coaching experience?
*  With those types of jobs, it's tough. Especially as a first-time bank coach, if I was in,
*  I don't know if that's the perfect situation. Maybe he thinks that's the perfect situation,
*  but I always feel like as a first-time bank coach, it's kind of like a make-or-break situation for
*  you because if you succeed, great, you're going to be coached for years and years. But if you
*  mishandle it and you don't succeed, those coaches are usually bound to be fired within a year or two
*  if you don't accomplish anything. You could find yourself in a situation where it's like,
*  you didn't do a good job in that situation, why should we hire him? So I mean, I love him,
*  I'm happy for him. He's always wanted to be a coach, but that's a tough job.
*  Just to go back to the Olympics, other countries are better than ever at basketball. They have more
*  NBA players on their teams than they did in the past. Do you have any doubt about who's going to
*  win the gold medal? You look at the talent that the U.S. has, but there's also equal talent on
*  other teams. And the talent that's on the U.S. team, you also got to understand most of those guys are
*  most of those guys are also older. Like LeBron now is not the LeBron that was a couple years ago.
*  So it's a big difference. So the name might be there, but everybody was a buddha, and you can see
*  for yourself, like the athletic LeBron and the dominant that he was a couple years ago is not the
*  same that he is now. So yeah, I mean, I think people get fooled by the names that are on paper.
*  But yeah, those names have been built throughout their career and now they're older. So they're not
*  what they used to be. You know, I just teed you up to say the U.S. is going to kick everyone's ass.
*  Instead you gave an even-handed nuanced answer. I mean, that's the goal. And you also got to
*  understand like a lot of us haven't played with each other. So that's going to be a brand new start.
*  And you got to learn each other and, you know, find the best way to play together.
*  Before we go, I just want to say that you know that the like the sports media hot take machine
*  is going to go into overdrive because you said that, you know, if it hadn't been for injuries,
*  you'd be in the greatest of all time conversation. That's okay. Because that's the truth.
*  You think about what I've been able to accomplish and what has been taken away
*  because of injuries. Like, you know, there's a lot of what ifs, but then again,
*  you can make the case of being up there. You know, you also in the context of your younger
*  brother talked about your understanding that life is bigger than basketball. At the end of the day,
*  the wins and losses are like they're actually not the most important thing.
*  Do you think there's any way in which understanding that inhibits your own fire or will to win? Like,
*  if you actually know that winning is not the most important thing, does that in any way hold you
*  back? No, because if you hold me back, I would have never been through injuries. No, I live in
*  the present and the present means any chance that I get go after it as far as winning. But then also
*  understanding that when I'm done, I should not have any regrets.
*  Joelle, thank you for taking all the time to talk with me and good luck at the Olympics.
*  Thank you. Appreciate you.
