# Ready or Not, Driverless Cars Are Here
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L-NSPfU1RY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, after a closely watched vote, driverless cars, once a Silicon Valley fantasy, have
*  become a 24-hour-a-day reality in San Francisco.
*  My colleague, Cade Metz, describes the unique challenges of coexisting with cars that drive
*  themselves.
*  It's Wednesday, August 23rd.
*  Cade, we have invited you into our studio here in New York to tell us about what's
*  Which doesn't sound very efficient, but be that as it may, San Francisco has become the
*  capital of this grand experiment of driverless cars.
*  And I want you to just describe what it's like to live in San Francisco in that new
*  reality.
*  As you walk through the streets, there are hundreds of these cars driving around almost
*  constantly in most of the city.
*  Once you get out of the downtown area, the financial district, you cannot walk a block
*  without seeing one of these cars.
*  And if you're a first-timer in San Francisco or you've arrived for the first time in years,
*  you cannot believe what you're seeing.
*  Hundreds of cars driving around with no one in the driver's seat.
*  These cars are not hard to spot.
*  They're outfitted with all sorts of sensors designed to detect everything that's going
*  on in the world around them.
*  These are big, sometimes trash can sized sensors that spin.
*  And you can't...
*  I'm getting an image of like some hybrid between a police car and a kid with braces.
*  An analogy I like to make is the Ghostbusters car, the car from the original Ghostbusters
*  1984, which has all this stuff all over it.
*  Okay, so you've been in these cars.
*  I want you to just describe the whole experience of getting in the car and how you even get
*  one of these driverless cars, because obviously it's not just a regular old like hail system.
*  Let's go to my most recent drive, which was last Wednesday.
*  I pulled open my Waymo app where I can hail a car much as you would an Uber.
*  The difference was it wouldn't pick me up exactly where I wanted it to pick me up.
*  It gave me a spot in an alleyway about a block and a half away where there's less traffic.
*  And eventually my car pulls up.
*  I pull the app out again and there's a little button on the app that says unlock.
*  Good to see you, Cade.
*  As I step into a car, a disembodied voice comes over the speaker that welcomes me by
*  name.
*  Hello, Cade.
*  As we get going, just give us one minute to cover a few riding tips.
*  It also gives me a short safety briefing.
*  We'll do all the driving, so please don't touch the steering wheel or pedals during
*  your ride.
*  Then the wheel starts to turn on its own.
*  The car starts to move.
*  It's like being in the car with my daughter just after she had turned 16 and was learning
*  to drive.
*  On edge.
*  Yes and no.
*  I'm on edge because my daughter is a new driver, but also I have a daughter who is wonderfully
*  conscientious.
*  She is so careful when she drives.
*  She would stop several feet before she got to the intersection.
*  But that's what these driverless cars are like.
*  They drive at the pace and with a care of a particularly conscientious 16-year-old driver.
*  As the drive continues up and down the hills of San Francisco, it is taking much longer
*  than it would have taken in an Uber because of that overly cautious nature of the car.
*  You're here.
*  Please make sure it's clear before exiting.
*  So overall, how do you rate this ride?
*  This ghostly, driverless, cautious version of a taxi ride?
*  It got me to where I wanted to go, but it took an awful long time, relatively speaking,
*  to get me there.
*  Now, the flip side, it's also like a ride at Disney World where it's a real novelty.
*  It's something that you don't necessarily experience every day.
*  You take this ride with your senses heightened, aware of this strange thing that you're doing.
*  Like a lot of novelties injected into the real world like this, it is the subject of
*  extreme debate, particularly in San Francisco where these cars have been causing accidents.
*  In some cases, those accidents cause injuries.
*  They run into emergency vehicles.
*  They do things that they are not supposed to do.
*  And increasingly, that is a concern for many of the residents of San Francisco who don't
*  want their city to be a petri dish for these types of cars that may cause serious problems
*  with daily life.
*  Right.
*  I'm thinking back to what you just said.
*  It's like a ride at Disney World, but San Francisco is not Disney World.
*  It's a city with public streets and pedestrians.
*  And so that makes me want to understand how we have gotten to this moment where an experiment
*  on the scale that you are describing is even possible.
*  So tell us the story of how we arrive at this moment where San Francisco is filled
*  with these ghostly driverless vehicles.
*  Scientists and researchers have been trying to build autonomous vehicles since the 60s.
*  The aim, and it is largely driven by labs funded by the Defense Department, is to build
*  autonomous vehicles for the military.
*  It's better to have a vehicle, a tank that does not have a driver behind the wheel, so
*  to speak.
*  In case it gets shot at, destroyed.
*  Exactly.
*  That's the rough goal.
*  But as time goes on, people start to realize that you can do this for civilians as well,
*  that you can use the same technology and use it to drive an ordinary car and potentially
*  change our lives as well.
*  Potentially build a car that is safer than a human being.
*  Technology does not get tired.
*  Technology does not drink whiskey and get behind the wheel.
*  There are all sorts of advantages to having technology drive as opposed to humans if you
*  can get technology to the level where it can drive as well as we require.
*  And when does that start to happen?
*  It starts to happen around 2005.
*  DARPA, which is the research arm of the Defense Department, organizes a contest.
*  And the idea is to get all sorts of research teams to build a driverless vehicle and then
*  compete with each other to see whose is most proficient.
*  And two guys notice that this is happening.
*  They happen to be the founders of Google.
*  Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
*  One of the leaders of one of the research teams, a guy named Sebastian Thrun, tells
*  the story of Larry Page showing up at one of these competitions in disguise.
*  A hat, sunglasses so he won't be recognized.
*  What ends up happening is that Page hires Thrun to run a new lab at Google called Google
*  X.
*  And the idea is to go after what Page and his colleagues call moonshots.
*  Extremely ambitious technical projects.
*  The first thing they decide to go after is a driverless car.
*  The ultimate moonshot.
*  The ultimate moonshot.
*  Larry Page wants to put one of these in your driveway to put you in a car on a daily basis
*  that can drive by itself, get you to where you want to go while you're doing something else.
*  Taking a nap, reading to your kid.
*  Absolutely.
*  And that's something that excites a lot of people.
*  But there's an interesting difference of opinion between Thrun and Page that explains the next
*  10 years of development with this technology.
*  Larry Page, running a company like Google, wants to see this happen.
*  Sebastian Thrun, the man he's hired to run this lab and to run this project, he realizes
*  how difficult this will be.
*  He realizes how far they will have to go.
*  And he doesn't necessarily know how to get there.
*  And why is it such a challenge?
*  Why in Thrun's mind is it going to be so hard to realize Larry Page's vision of a driverless
*  car in every driveway?
*  Getting a car to make a left turn at an intersection is not difficult.
*  A right turn is not difficult.
*  Accelerating, braking, those things are not difficult.
*  What's difficult is dealing with all the chaos that we encounter every time we get into a
*  car.
*  The unexpected is likely to happen at any given second.
*  You have to have a machine that completely, first of all, recognize what is going on around
*  it.
*  You need to know that that is a pedestrian and not a bicycle.
*  Then once you are clear on everything that is around you, you need to predict what's
*  going to happen with each of those things.
*  And then once you predict what's going to happen, you need to develop a way of responding
*  to all that.
*  And that requires reason.
*  It requires a quality that machines still don't have and certainly didn't have in the
*  early 2000s.
*  Right.
*  Driving a car isn't just about steering the wheel as you go down the road.
*  It's about responding to all the possible things that could go wrong.
*  Dog runs out into the road, bike swerves into your path.
*  We as humans learn to respond instinctively to those.
*  It's harder to teach a robot to do that.
*  That's right.
*  But despite how challenging teaching a robot all that is, we know that this driverless
*  car technology does move forward.
*  So tell us how that happened.
*  Larry Page, the founder of Google, says go after this and Thrun goes after it.
*  Right.
*  Jump high.
*  So in 2009, Thrun and his colleagues at the new Google X Lab start building a driverless
*  car.
*  And by 2010, they quietly start testing this technology on the public roads of California.
*  A secret driverless car project that puts those driverless cars on the road.
*  The New York Times and my predecessor here, John Markoff, got wind of the project.
*  And in the fall of 2010, let the world know that it was happening.
*  And what is the response?
*  Well, it sets off a tech arms race.
*  Not only among dedicated technology companies like Google, but among a new type of company
*  which is doing ride hailing, Uber and Lyft, and the traditional car companies who now
*  see a threat to their way of doing things, they jump in and start competing as well.
*  And as companies like Google and Uber started to talk about this technology publicly,
*  Sebastian Thrun helped start Google's self-driving car program.
*  They talked about it as if it was around the corner.
*  Will they be functional in two to three years or available in two to three years?
*  They are functional today and they'd be available in two to three years.
*  They'd be in the marketplace.
*  If you were reading the tech press, if you were reading the mainstream press around that
*  time, ready or not, they're coming.
*  You assumed that by the following year, those driverless cars we've been hearing so much
*  about could soon be hitting the road, cruising right alongside us in the next few years.
*  You would have a driverless car in your driveway if you wanted.
*  Nissan plans to sell a driverless car in just five years and hopes to bring the self-driving
*  cars to the market by 2020.
*  Ford hopes to have a fully autonomous vehicle available by 2021.
*  Your driveway could disappear and so could parking lots and garages.
*  Freight and packages could all move at night.
*  And that was never the case.
*  There was some hype.
*  There's always hype in Silicon Valley.
*  In this case, the hype was particularly strong.
*  Okay.
*  So now that all these big players are pumping this extraordinary amount of money into this
*  unproven technology, what becomes of it?
*  On the surface, the types of cars being built were perfect.
*  If the drivers would get into a car in Mountain View, California, it would take them around
*  the block with nary a mistake.
*  But the reality below the surface was that building this technology was extremely difficult.
*  And that continued for years where the hype did not reflect the reality.
*  But then that changed in 2018.
*  Which is when?
*  There was a crash in Arizona involving an Uber test car.
*  A 49-year-old woman at night was crossing a multi-lane road with her bicycle.
*  She was struck and killed.
*  There was a safety driver behind the wheel who was supposed to take over if something
*  went wrong, but they did not.
*  The bottom line is someone was killed by a self-driving car and that almost immediately
*  set the industry back.
*  Yes, people behind the wheel are involved in accidents every day.
*  People die because of those accidents.
*  But if a new technology kills someone, that is far more concerning to the general public,
*  to regulators.
*  They start to wonder if this is going to work.
*  After the crash, Uber immediately pauses its efforts to test these vehicles not only in
*  Arizona but in California and in Pittsburgh.
*  Toyota follows suit.
*  And slowly all these companies start to admit that this is harder than they had let on.
*  Even Google starts to change the way it's doing things.
*  And self-driving car operation is spun out into a new company called Waymo.
*  And its ambitions start to morph away from that idea of a car in your driveway towards
*  the type of robo-taxi service that Uber and Lyft were building.
*  Rather than having a car in your driveway that could potentially drive anywhere, what
*  decide to do is let's limit a self-driving car service to a particular geographic area.
*  Narrow the variables.
*  That's the way it works.
*  If you put a ring around San Francisco, you limit your cars to that one city.
*  You can build a digital map, a literal 3D visual map of the city, and you can give that
*  map to the car, and then you test over and over and over again in that constrained environment.
*  You limit the chaos.
*  You limit the unexpected moments.
*  That's going to be easier.
*  And that's what the industry starts to go after.
*  And that's how we get to the point where San Francisco, the second most dense city in
*  America, becomes a testing ground for these driverless vehicles with hundreds of cars
*  driving around the city.
*  This goes on for years where multiple companies are testing these vehicles to ensure that
*  they are safe.
*  But as they test, it's the latest problem for autonomous vehicles.
*  A group of cruises driverless cars cause a major traffic congestion.
*  It becomes more and more clear to the people riding the cars and to other citizens in
*  the city that they are flawed.
*  A 21st century problem for San Francisco police now going viral.
*  What happens when you pull over a driverless car in a traffic stop?
*  That they do make mistakes.
*  Four driverless cars came to an abrupt and extended stop all within the same hour last
*  night.
*  Yeah, kind of crazy.
*  They backed up traffic.
*  They can gum up traffic.
*  It's a driverless cruise car inexplicably straddling two lanes, mid-merge stopping just
*  inches away from the site.
*  They can cause accidents.
*  The company's a cruise car stopped unexpectedly near the site of a mass shooting in San Francisco's
*  Mission District.
*  This happened earlier this month.
*  That they can cause injuries.
*  In May, one driverless car even hit and killed a dog.
*  All of this comes to a head with a public hearing earlier this month in California where
*  the future of these companies in this city will be decided.
*  The question on the table is can they operate in the city like an Uber or a Lyft only without
*  drivers behind the wheel?
*  But this decision is even bigger than that.
*  If these companies don't get approval in San Francisco, the flagship of their operations,
*  what happens in other cities across the country?
*  In a sense, this is a meeting where the future of the driverless car is at stake.
*  Absolutely.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Cade, set the scene for us at this meeting in San Francisco at which nothing short of
*  the future of the driverless car may be on the line.
*  This is a meeting where four state regulators are going to decide the future of two different
*  companies.
*  Cruise, which is owned by General Motors, and Waymo, which is owned by Google.
*  And San Francisco is a particularly interesting place for this type of vote.
*  San Francisco is very much a part of this city and has been for decades.
*  You're going to get people who do not hesitate to voice their opinions, their concerns over
*  this technology.
*  But at the same time, this is the center of technological innovation in the country and
*  maybe the world.
*  And you're going to get people who are equally adamant that this should happen and should
*  happen now.
*  Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the California Public Utilities Commission.
*  I'm calling this meeting...
*  Those two sides of San Francisco come together on August the 10th at this public hearing...
*  At today's meeting, the public will have the opportunity to make public comments either
*  in person or by telephone.
*  Where regulators are going to decide the future of this.
*  My name is Sage Kettemorn and I live in the Sunset District.
*  I'm here today to encourage the commission to approve Waymo's application.
*  My top concern is safety.
*  You get a group who are all for Waymo and Cruz starting paid rides immediately.
*  I'm keenly aware that my biggest risk when biking is that I may be taken out by a distracted
*  human driver.
*  This ranges from bicyclers...
*  This is Pumpkin.
*  She is a guide dog.
*  She guides me.
*  I am totally blind.
*  To people with disabilities, medical professionals...
*  I lost a family member to a traffic accident that was caught by a person who just fell
*  asleep in the car.
*  And all sorts of other reasons for why these cars should be allowed on the roads immediately.
*  Every single day without self-driving cars, 10 Californians are killed, about 100 Americans.
*  Another 200 Californians, 2,000 Americans are injured.
*  And there are literally millions who cannot drive and are unnecessarily prevented from
*  going where they need to go to live their best life.
*  Every day matters.
*  Please approve the expansion of self-driving cars without delay.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  It sounds like above all, they're making an argument around safety.
*  Safety is the prime argument.
*  But there are other arguments.
*  My name is Sean Durkin.
*  I am a rider in driverless vehicles.
*  As a gender nonconforming person, I experienced ride share drivers who have left me on the
*  side of the street who refuse to open their vehicle.
*  This technology does not discriminate against people in the way that a human driver would.
*  A taxi driver might pass someone up on the street.
*  An electric autonomous vehicle ride ensures that I don't have to worry about comments,
*  harassment or worse, physical assault regarding my ethnicity, gender presentation or sexuality
*  from human drivers.
*  And then there are people who stood up and just gave the classic Silicon Valley justification.
*  One can build the future by prioritizing safety above everything else.
*  Technological progress has to happen.
*  We can always add regulation later, but we can't make up for the lost time.
*  If we hold these companies back now, this technology will be built somewhere else.
*  Please vote yes.
*  Thank you.
*  Your poodle be damned.
*  Exactly.
*  Thank you, commissioners.
*  My name is Michael Smith and I'm the technical co-founder of a successful startup here in
*  San Francisco.
*  And I strongly support tech when it's useful, safe and actually works.
*  And of course, there are just as many arguments on the other side.
*  The robo taxis, I want to point out though, they currently do not meet that criteria and
*  should not be expanded at this time.
*  People who argue that this is not as safe as human drivers.
*  They have caused over 600 incidences and interfered with emergency services.
*  That it's going to prevent fire trucks and police cars from getting to where they need
*  to go.
*  Hello.
*  Good afternoon, commissioners.
*  My name is Rosin Boussini.
*  I am an Uber and a Lyft driver for over seven years.
*  People also argued as they often argue as new technology is rising up.
*  This self-driving taxi is going to take away jobs away from families.
*  This will take away existing jobs.
*  It's going to take a job away from people like me.
*  I'm a single mom.
*  Yet Uber drivers who now earn their living driving around the city will be replaced by
*  driverless cars.
*  Sometimes I wonder, do you all just hate people?
*  But we were people.
*  We're supposed to be taking care of other people.
*  And these are jobs.
*  And you know what?
*  It's going to be your jobs next.
*  So take that into consideration.
*  And you get all sorts of people showing up.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Here we are again.
*  San Francisco about to have four people make a decision on whether or not the city is going
*  to be pimped out by yet another couple of large tech companies.
*  Who are just angry at the technology industry.
*  This process reminds me of an old Twilight Zone episode where you have this normal happy
*  little town, everybody going about their business and wholesome and all.
*  And then the camera pulls back and you see it's like a giant ant farm.
*  That anger has been building for many years in San Francisco.
*  And there's some big hulking spider like being behind it sort of chuckling and saying, I
*  think they're almost ready to eat now.
*  As tech workers take over the city, really change the fabric of the city.
*  And the cost of the city.
*  And the cost of the city.
*  And some people are just fed up and this is an outlet for them to voice their anger.
*  A car has to have a driver in it.
*  It's insane not to have a driver in a car.
*  I don't know why anybody can say that that's okay.
*  Right, because what could better embody the kind of disembodied power of tech and its
*  money and all that perhaps people don't like about that than literally a driverless car.
*  Sometimes it's hard to pin down technology and the changes it is making.
*  This is a physical technology in a physical place that is causing real chaos in the city.
*  Okay, so all these people testify, but ultimately, as you said, just four people are actually
*  going to vote.
*  So how does that vote actually go?
*  In a vote of three to one, the commission votes in favor of Waymo and Cruz to allow
*  paid driverless rides across San Francisco immediately.
*  And this is a sign that these companies can also move ahead across the country with their ambitions.
*  And in that sense, they're opening the driverless Pandora's box.
*  So what happens after this vote?
*  We see inside this Pandora's box almost immediately.
*  Within a week, there are two accidents involving Cruz that really open people's eyes.
*  One of these Cruz cars does not properly recognize a construction zone and drives into wet cement.
*  Talk about a moment that can be easily shared over and over again on social media.
*  And I assume it was.
*  It was indeed.
*  Now there have been incidents like this for years in the city involving these cars, but
*  amidst this vote, there's added scrutiny to the technology and people start to notice
*  what is going on.
*  Right, or what's going wrong.
*  Right.
*  A few days after the cement incident, there's an accident involving a fire truck in San
*  Francisco where a passenger in a cruise vehicle is injured.
*  The very next day, the California DMV asked Cruz to cut its driverless car fleet in half.
*  So they drop it from about 400 cars down to 200.
*  Well, that's interesting.
*  The state commission votes to allow this technology to expand and then the DMV turns around, what,
*  a couple days, week or so later and says, pay it back.
*  What do you make of that?
*  Well, it shows what has been obvious for a long time is that these cars are flawed and
*  it's all about how much tolerance we as a society have for those flaws.
*  In this path towards this utopia where technology can do everything on its own and make the
*  world safer, how much chaos, how many accidents, how many injuries are okay as we reach for
*  that goal?
*  Well, I guess that's a good question.
*  How much tolerance should there be when it comes to driverless cars?
*  Because the incidents you just mentioned, the car going into the wet cement, surely
*  that's embarrassing, but does it fundamentally change our understanding of the safety of
*  these cars?
*  And isn't this kind of glitchiness the natural course of technological advancement?
*  There's a period of transition, it's rough, until eventually there's widespread adoption.
*  Or is the case of the driverless car special?
*  Is there something about taking a human being out of a two ton moving piece of metal that
*  means our tolerance is just going to be lower?
*  How do you think about that?
*  How should we think about it?
*  Our tolerance is absolutely going to be lower.
*  That's the way our minds are wired.
*  We as human beings trust human skill and ingenuity and we trust our own judgment to make the
*  right decision when lives are at stake.
*  Do we trust this technology, which in so many ways is not as adept as we are, that cannot
*  reason like we can, does not have the common sense that you and I really depend on and
*  depend on others to have?
*  It does not have that.
*  It has many other things that we do not.
*  It has more sensors.
*  It can process data faster in some ways, but it doesn't have that thing that makes us human.
*  Do we trust that thing that is so different from us to replace us?
*  That is a hard question for anyone to answer.
*  And that's what we're trying to answer here.
*  Right.
*  And I think that raises the question that goes all the way back to the beginning of
*  our conversation into that moonshot that Google's co-founder Larry Page introduced.
*  The question being, is this a moonshot, the driverless car that any of us really need?
*  That is still an open question.
*  We don't know whether we really need this.
*  And even if we are sure of that, it's unclear whether the technology can satisfy that need.
*  We don't know yet if it's safer than a human driver.
*  We don't yet know if it's cheaper than a human driver, which it also needs to be.
*  What's going on in San Francisco is an opportunity to answer that question and to see whether
*  or not the need is there and whether or not the technology can satisfy that need.
*  And when are we going to know the answer?
*  I won't hold you to it.
*  It took 13 years to get to this point.
*  It's going to take years to get to that point where we can really answer that question.
*  Okay.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Times reports that Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia may be faltering because it
*  has positioned too many of its troops in the wrong places.
*  The central goal of the counteroffensive is to cut off Russian supply lines in Ukraine's
*  south, but U.S. military leaders say that Ukrainian commanders have divided troops and
*  firepower between Ukraine's south and east, effectively spreading them too thin.
*  And eight candidates have qualified for tonight's first Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee,
*  which will not feature the race's frontrunner, Donald Trump, who has refused to participate.
*  The candidates include Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, Trump's former Vice President
*  Mike Pence, former governors Chris Christie and Nikki Haley, Senator Tim Scott of South
*  Carolina, and the conservative businessman Vivek Ramaswamy.
*  The debate will begin at 9 p.m. Eastern.
*  Today's episode was produced by Ricky Navetsky, Olivia Gnat, and Luke Vanderplooke with help
*  from Shannon Lin and Jessica Chung.
*  It was edited by Devin Taylor with help from Michael Benoit, Paige Cowitt, and Lisa Chow.
*  Contains original music by Marian Lozano, Rowan Inisto, and Dan Powell, and was engineered

*  See you tomorrow.
