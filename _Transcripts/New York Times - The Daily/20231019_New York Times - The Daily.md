# A Texas Town Wanted Tougher Border Security. Now Itâ€™s Having Regrets.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JATtPwKas_c)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Boborow.
*  This is The Daily.
*  When the governor of Texas announced an unprecedented plan to use local law enforcement to stop
*  the flow of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border, few communities were more receptive
*  than the city of Eagle Pass, where residents had become fed up with the federal government's
*  approach.
*  Today, two years later, my colleagues, national correspondent Edgar Sandoval and Daily producer
*  Nina Feldman, traveled to Eagle Pass to find out why the people who once welcomed the plan
*  are now turning against it.
*  It's Thursday, October 19th.
*  Edgar, tell us about this trip that you just took to the U.S.-Mexico border.
*  So a few weeks ago, I traveled to the town of Eagle Pass, Texas, with a producer from
*  The Daily, Nina Feldman.
*  We're going to turn right towards the International Bridge.
*  And the thing to know about Eagle Pass is it's right on the Rio Grande, directly across
*  from the town of Yeras Negras, Mexico.
*  Not unlike the town where I went to high school and college in McAllen, Texas.
*  So you can just cross on that bridge and you're in Mexico in a few minutes.
*  And it's really one town divided by the river, the Rio Grande, right?
*  So there are about 30,000 residents, and a lot of them live on one side and work on the
*  other side.
*  And as a border town in Eagle Pass, they have always been used to illegal crossings.
*  But it's also become one of the front lines of something else, you know, this grand experiment
*  by the Texas government to tackle the issue of illegal crossings.
*  So we have arrived.
*  And to understand that experiment, I needed to talk to people who had personal experiences
*  with it.
*  Hi!
*  Hello, Ms. Urvina, how are you?
*  People like Magali Urvina.
*  Hi, Magali.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  So Magali's family has been in Eagle Pass for three generations.
*  She and her husband are middle-aged and own this big, beautiful pecan farm right by the
*  Rio Grande.
*  My husband was looking for a place to build our retirement home.
*  And we had lots of free time to drive around town and we found this orchard and fell in
*  love with it.
*  And mind you, the Urvinas are not farmers by training.
*  She was a teacher and a hero in the oil industry.
*  What drew you guys to the farm?
*  The land, the greenery, the trees, the river.
*  The river.
*  Yeah.
*  And once they bought it, they really fell in love with the place.
*  And on this farm, Edgar, what is this couple's relationship to the U.S.-Mexico border and
*  to migrants?
*  You know, like a lot of people who live on the border, they're used to it.
*  I've seen it my entire life.
*  You would see maybe five, six single men, young men coming across.
*  You used to see clusters of migrants being apprehended by the border patrol every time
*  they drive to the grocery store or to the pharmacy.
*  So periodic crossings are a fact of life.
*  In fact, Magali was so used to it that she used to put water in her property for migrants
*  that were crossing because she saw them just like thirsty and looking for help.
*  It just made more sense.
*  You're going to let them in.
*  Give them water.
*  But the Urebinas were totally unprepared for what happened in 2021.
*  Turning back to the border crisis now, the number of unaccompanied migrant children at
*  the southern border is also on the rise.
*  Over 15,000 unaccompanied minors now in U.S. custody, 5,000 of them with border patrol.
*  Immigration authorities still struggling to find them.
*  Shortly after Biden took office, migrants started to rush the border.
*  The U.S. is on track to see the highest number of illegal border crossers in 20 years.
*  And it didn't take long for people living in towns like Eagle Pass to feel the effects
*  of this.
*  It was late in the summer of 2021 where I started noticing women, a lot more women.
*  And I saw children, a lot of unaccompanied children.
*  Magali and her husband started seeing this huge number of migrants.
*  It was just shocking to see so many people and then you would see them completely naked
*  getting out of the river.
*  They would film across the Rio Grande.
*  They would step in her backyard and they would cut across her pecan farm.
*  Hundreds of people that we would see in town that were not from here.
*  We all, everybody sees it.
*  Eagle Pass was being overwhelmed.
*  Police were getting a lot more service costs from residents, complaining of more people
*  crossing in their backyard.
*  There were just a lot more migrants than the city could handle.
*  It was like normal.
*  That's when I told myself and my husband, this is not right.
*  There's something wrong with this picture and we should not become immune to it.
*  In the first Democratic primary debate, Biden says when he's president, illegal immigrants
*  should immediately, this is quote, immediately surge to the border.
*  And it's always displaying on the southern border.
*  This entire crisis is created simply by Joe Biden's actions and words.
*  Republicans were pointing the blame squarely at the White House.
*  Well, look, I guess I should be flattered.
*  People are coming because I'm the nice guy.
*  That's the reason why it's happening.
*  Truth of the matter is nothing has changed.
*  Biden defended himself, you know, saying that this problem started before he even became
*  president.
*  It had nothing to do with him.
*  There was a 31% increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things
*  at the border.
*  That's not the reason they're coming.
*  And the truth is that between the pandemic, you know, the situation on the ground in central
*  South America and the change of administrations, it's hard to point out just one reason that
*  crossings were going up.
*  But crossings were up.
*  My phone has been ringing off the hook from ranchers in this region and regions west of
*  here.
*  Meanwhile, about the dramatic increase in the number of people who are crossing their
*  ranches and causing mayhem on their ranches.
*  Texas Governor Greg Avid.
*  So he was going to go around the federal government.
*  Texas is not going to shy away from stepping up and filling the gap that the federal government
*  has left open.
*  And just deal with the border himself.
*  We've launched Operation Lone Star.
*  He came up with this plan called Operation Lone Star.
*  Right.
*  And we've covered Operation Lone Star on the show in the past.
*  It was unusual because here was a governor of a state saying that state government was
*  going to do this rule that has traditionally been carried out by the federal government,
*  which is secure the border.
*  Right.
*  It was sort of like, you know, move over.
*  I'm taking charge.
*  We're ready.
*  We're waiting for you.
*  If you dare step into the state of Texas, Texas will use every tool and strategy we
*  can to arrest anybody who's violating the law, to put behind the bars anybody's violating
*  the law, to make sure that the laws in the state of Texas are going to be enforced.
*  You know, Avid's plan is to send a huge number of Texas National Guard troops and state troopers
*  to fortify the border and more aggressively seek out migrants who are crossing illegally.
*  And one of the places where Avid implemented Operation Lone Star was Eagle Pass.
*  And Edgar, how welcome or unwelcome is Abbott's plan to have the state fill in for the federal
*  government in Eagle Pass with people like Magali?
*  Very welcome.
*  People like Magali were really grateful that the governor had this plan, you know, in Magali
*  to be clear border for Abbott.
*  So it makes sense that she would trust the promise that he's making, you know, to deal
*  with this problem.
*  Caribbean people who didn't board for Abbott realized there was a problem.
*  Come on in, guys.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  We're going to go to the left now.
*  And one of those people is Jesse Fuentes.
*  I just turned on the air.
*  We can sit out here if you want or we can sit in the little library in there if however
*  you're comfortable.
*  Jesse grew up in Eagle Pass.
*  He's a Democrat.
*  Like I said, we grew up a couple of blocks from the river.
*  So we were at the river every day.
*  We were in the water.
*  We were fishing.
*  We were playing mudball flies.
*  He actually runs a business giving kayak tours on the river.
*  And that's giving him an up close view to see in this search.
*  I mean, you could see that that federal forces were a little overwhelmed.
*  And even he was seeing that there was a need for some sort of intervention.
*  Because people were everywhere.
*  And I understood that we needed help.
*  And so when he hears about this idea of Operation Longstar, he thinks it could really help.
*  Were people initially like you also hopeful and welcoming of that help?
*  Was there anticipation?
*  I think there was optimism that they were going to come in, they were going to help
*  us control it within the norms, that they were going to work with a custom border protection
*  and there was going to be an amazing control or security without cruelty.
*  Like a lot of people in Eagle Pass, I think he was really hopeful.
*  He wanted to believe that Operation Longstar was going to fix everything.
*  You know, I think of the traveling angel genre of film where, you know, the good guy comes
*  to town, he rescues the town and he rides off on the horse and he leaves.
*  I said, that's what's going to happen.
*  They're going to come in, they're going to help us get it under control, establish operating
*  procedures, and move on.
*  And I was tolerant of it, like everybody else.
*  What elements attracted you that you heard from the governor?
*  That you know, we're going to help you.
*  We're here to help you.
*  Did he say how?
*  No, he didn't.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, amid all this optimism from the residents of Eagle Pass, what does Operation Longstar
*  actually look like there in practice?
*  So, Operation Longstar really hinges on this idea.
*  The National Guard members and state troopers will come to towns like Eagle Pass and help
*  Border Patrol deal with the search.
*  But the problem is, you know, these troops don't actually have jurisdiction to operate
*  on the border.
*  That's really a function of the federal government.
*  So the governor came out with a workaround.
*  The officers have to work with private landowners and make arrangements to station themselves
*  on the property.
*  And oftentimes, they arrest migrants who have just crossed over.
*  They charge them with trespassing.
*  And other times, they just bring them over to the Border Patrol.
*  So because state police can't arrest people for immigration offenses, you're saying they
*  have to arrest them specifically for trespassing and they have to do that on the property of
*  willing private landowners who give them permission to do that.
*  Exactly.
*  You know, and my colleague and her husband were among the first landowners to cooperate
*  in Eagle Pass.
*  When he was talking about Longstar, they came to us and they invited us to meetings and
*  they said that they wanted to put up a fence because there were so many people crossing
*  and we were okay with it.
*  My husband and I...
*  You know, first they signed a contract where they basically gave up control to some of
*  their property, especially the areas facing the river.
*  And the agreement was initially just to allow the state police to build a fence.
*  That way, they would deter migrants from crossing to their property or funnel the migrants into
*  a smaller area.
*  And how did that work out at the beginning?
*  What was that like?
*  It was fine.
*  Everybody was in that corner, which is why we said, keep it to the corner, stay away
*  from the orchard because it's a business.
*  Just makes sense.
*  And at the beginning is going well, you know, there's more control of migrants in their
*  property than the state police and the National Guardsmen give them a sense of safety.
*  But then one day she goes down to the river in her property.
*  That day, they just showed up and they just started putting seawater and I told them we
*  didn't want it.
*  We had already talked to the state.
*  She says the state troopers, the National Guardsmen, installing a long row of Costantina
*  wire along the river with her property.
*  She's kind of taken aback by this.
*  I didn't like it one bit.
*  I just knew that there's nothing I could do and I'm not the type that's going to just
*  throw myself and just stop, stop.
*  I just said, OK, I'm not.
*  It has to happen.
*  There's nothing I could do.
*  I'm by myself.
*  They're not listening to me.
*  It lifts her feeling a sense of uneasiness because when she looks at her property now
*  is just this wall of Costantina wire, two or three tiers on top of each other with this
*  sharp razors, you know.
*  Right.
*  Which is the kind of site you normally see outside a prison, these loops of Constraintina
*  wire not normally associated with someone's yard.
*  Exactly.
*  And that wasn't the only barrier they installed.
*  Yeah.
*  Can you just describe what what we're looking at here?
*  We are at the northern part of our property on the river side.
*  And you can see that the river is about 25, 30 yards from us and the buoys are about 50
*  yards from us.
*  They also installed buoys.
*  There's just this long string of orange balls outside her property by the river.
*  And the purpose is to prevent migrants from crossing.
*  But of course, when Magali goes to the property by the river, she just sees this like giant
*  orange balls the size of dumpsters.
*  Wow.
*  The next thing she knows, you know, they're building roads on her property just for the
*  vehicles from the state police, humbys, military vehicles.
*  They can now crisscross the property looking for migrants.
*  Just to be clear, they're building actual roads on her orchard.
*  That's exactly right, you know.
*  And what this results in is that all this dust from the trucks are hitting her trees,
*  which really affects the growth of the pecans that she was trying to grow during her harvest
*  season.
*  These are the trees that have just just so much dust just constantly.
*  She points at us that the leaves of the trees just look brown, you know.
*  There are no, no, one.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And they're not growing any pecans.
*  They should have at least, you would be able to see one.
*  There's nothing.
*  Because it's about to be the harvest, right?
*  Right.
*  And she's really frustrated because she can compare that to areas where there are no state
*  officials and that part of her property is actually growing pecans.
*  Hmm.
*  So it's starting to very much feel like Magali is losing control of her land, which is no
*  doubt very frustrating to her.
*  But it's got to be complicated by the reality that she signed a contract letting the state
*  come into her property and do all of this, right?
*  Exactly.
*  So people like Magali and her husband were the ones who kind of agreed to this arrangement.
*  Okay.
*  Well, what about Jesse, this canoe and kayak operator you mentioned earlier?
*  What was his experience like with Operation Lone Star?
*  Yeah.
*  He would run his business in Shelby Park, which is a park and downtown Eagle Pass next
*  to the Rio Grande.
*  But once Operation Lone Star came, almost overnight, the park became a staging ground.
*  What we're looking at here is the staging area for Operation Lone Star.
*  For military trucks, checkpoints for migrants crossing in.
*  The biggest concentration of air boats.
*  Because remember, the park is right next to the river.
*  There's a stack of shipping containers.
*  There's officers everywhere.
*  They eliminated all the flora and the fauna on the edges of the riverbank.
*  More wires like the one Magali is looking at everything in her property.
*  They bulldozed the highway along the edge of it.
*  They erased about five different islands that were in the middle of the river.
*  They've killed our river.
*  They've killed it.
*  So Jesse decides that he can't really run tours on the river anymore.
*  The place is overrun by military vehicles and police officers.
*  It's just no place for him to operate a business.
*  Right.
*  And I'm presuming that there isn't a whole lot of interest in taking a kayak or canoe
*  tour of the Rio Grande at a place where it's been that militarized.
*  I mean, how can I promote this?
*  You know?
*  How can you promote this?
*  Right.
*  So he feels like he has no place to go now.
*  He took his kayaks and his canoes back to his property away from the river.
*  And he's hoping for the day when Operation Lone Star will cease to be an eagle pass.
*  But he's wondering if that's going to take months, years, or perhaps never.
*  So at this point, Operation Lone Star, which originally had been welcomed with pretty much
*  open arms by people like Magali and Jesse, is now turning into quite a major headache
*  for them both.
*  Correct.
*  You know, it's not just Magali and Jesse who are mad.
*  It seems like everyone you talk to in Eagle Pass is going increasingly upset.
*  And a series of events that happened over the summer really brings that anger to a
*  head.
*  And happening now on the border, four migrants drowned in the Rio Grande in a 48-hour time
*  span.
*  In July, several migrants drowned in the river.
*  A woman and an infant were found unresponsive in Eagle Pass.
*  There is backlash following claims DPS troopers were ordered to mistreat illegal immigrants
*  crossing the border.
*  And then later that month, a state trooper came out and said that he and his colleagues
*  had been directed to turn migrants back in the middle of the river, you know, instead
*  of bringing them ashore for processing.
*  And they had also been directed to deny people water.
*  The trooper wrote, I believe we've stepped over the line into inhumane.
*  And meanwhile, you know, the staff at the shelter in town were reporting that migrants
*  were showing up with gaping wounds from crossing through the consentina wire.
*  What I saw on the river today, that's not what I want to be known for.
*  And you see this real big pouring of objection from locals, you know, about what they see
*  as more than just an issue with their property, the eyesores, but increasingly, you know,
*  what they see as a moral failure.
*  So, Edgar, it feels like the costs of Operation Lone Star have turned out to be very high
*  for the residents.
*  It's meant giving up land, views, river access, even in the case of Magali, business.
*  And the humanitarian cost is also very high.
*  But the deal was you pay these costs and you get border security.
*  So the question is, is border security what Eagle Pass ultimately got?
*  Quite simply, no.
*  Over the first two years of Operation Lone Star, crossings have gotten up and down in
*  places like Eagle Pass.
*  But most recently, the town has seen a huge surge in illegal crossings.
*  For people like Magali, I don't think this is surprising.
*  I was going to ask, so has it worked?
*  Has it helped, any of it?
*  They're still coming through.
*  Here it's just slowed it down, like two neighbors down to the north of us.
*  They're taking, pulling them out through there.
*  And Magali said fewer people are coming directly to her property, but instead they're going
*  around to her neighbor's property.
*  Like how many people would you say a month these days or a week?
*  I drove by, maybe it was last week and I saw maybe 70, 80 people in the evening.
*  What was your reaction to that?
*  Well, we all know, no, we all know that it's still happening.
*  It's just they're saying that they're stopping it, but all they're doing is just pushing
*  it to the sides.
*  So given how all of this has turned out, how does Magali feel about the fact that she decided
*  to take on such a big role in this operation?
*  I think she feels conflicted about it.
*  On one hand, she really wanted to see a solution, but this is definitely not what she envisioned.
*  I think they sold us one idea and then we got another.
*  Not just me, everybody down here.
*  She told me that if she had known that all of these things were going to happen in her
*  property, she would never have agreed to cooperate.
*  Like I said, if they would have painted this picture and said, this is what we're going
*  to do after you worked on here and done all this to your property, we're going to come
*  in here and do this to it and destroy it.
*  Well, why would I say no way?
*  Do you think this disuades migrants from coming over when they see the buoys and the, of course,
*  you know why you're in the fences, just visually, do you think that's...
*  No.
*  They've crossed through the Guderian gap and they've left some loved ones there and they
*  got up and they kept walking.
*  This is not going to stop them.
*  At the end of the day, Magali feels like she's back where she started in 2021 and she's
*  growing increasingly frustrated by the lack of solution from any elected official.
*  So I ask her, does she feel like anyone is actually trying to help her now?
*  You spoke to Democrats and Republicans about this.
*  What are you hearing back from them?
*  Nothing.
*  We don't hear anything other than it's just the other one's fault.
*  It's the blame game.
*  They need to address it.
*  Everybody that's been using it for their own political gain needs to just stop and think,
*  if you all really care, they all say they care about the United States of America and
*  if it's in the best interest for us all, then do it.
*  Stop using it.
*  Why don't they?
*  All you hear is blame, blame, blame, blame.
*  They've been blaming people since what, the 60s, 70s, the 80s, the 90s.
*  Who are we going to blame next year?
*  Who are you going to blame in 10 years?
*  Why don't you all want to fix it?
*  What do you mean when you say don't use it?
*  They all use it when they're running for office.
*  Immigration is one of those things that they talk about when they're all...
*  They say that, you know, we're going to have a presidential election.
*  But your take is that it's a lot of talk.
*  Yes, and we've seen them all.
*  A lot of people have come down here and what do they all say and what have they done?
*  Well, Edgar, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  The Times reports that Texas Governor Greg Abbott is now seeking new legal powers to
*  strengthen Operation Lone Star.
*  Abbott, frustrated that state police can only arrest migrants on charges of trespassing
*  on private land, is trying to change Texas law so that police can arrest migrants on
*  any property along the Texas border by making illegal crossings a state crime.
*  Such a law, which is likely to be challenged in court, would be a direct challenge to federal
*  authority over immigration.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Wednesday, as President Biden arrived in Israel, both the US and Israel said that early
*  evidence showed that the deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza was caused by Palestinian
*  fighters, not by Israel.
*  The evidence gathered by the US, including satellite and infrared imagery, suggests that
*  a rocket fired from a position in Gaza misfired and landed on the hospital, where it killed
*  hundreds of civilians.
*  I come to Israel with a single message.
*  You're not alone.
*  You are not alone.
*  In a rare wartime speech to the Israeli people, Biden compared Hamas's attack on Israel
*  last weekend to the trauma of the September 11th terror attacks against the United States
*  in 2001.
*  You can't look at what has happened here to your mothers, your fathers, your grandparents,
*  sons, daughters, children, even babies, and not scream out for justice.
*  Justice must be done.
*  But even as Biden pledged American support to Israel, he took pains to call for restraint
*  during its coming invasion of Gaza, invoking America's own excesses after 9-11.
*  But I caution this while you feel that rage.
*  Don't be consumed by it.
*  After 9-11, we were in rage in the United States.
*  While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.
*  And for the second time in two days, Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio lost a vote
*  to become Speaker of the House, this time by an even wider margin than he did on Tuesday,
*  as moderate Republicans once again rejected his ultra-conservative record.
*  One of those moderate Republicans, Mike Lawler of New York, told CNN that Jordan has little
*  chance of ever prevailing.
*  Look, it's clear he doesn't have the votes.
*  I don't see the outcome changing here.
*  And so the question for Jim and for the conference is, how do we get back to work?
*  With the House unable to elect a speaker, there were growing calls to empower a temporary,
*  unelected speaker to carry out the chamber's work, perhaps through the end of the year.
