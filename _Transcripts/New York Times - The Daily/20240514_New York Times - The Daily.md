# Voters Want Change. In Our Poll, They See It in Trump.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJLaR6xAgbs)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily Today.
*  A new poll showing former President Donald Trump leading President Biden in five of six
*  battleground states.
*  According to the latest New York Times CNN polls, among likely voters, Trump is ahead
*  in Wisconsin, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Pennsylvania.
*  Frankly, for the Joe Biden campaign, these numbers are an absolute disaster.
*  The smallest lead is in Arizona for Donald Trump.
*  He's up six.
*  Look at this, nine in Georgia, 13 in Nevada.
*  My goodness gracious, my God, that is a huge lead.
*  What the latest Times poll reveals about President Biden's challenges, Donald Trump's strengths
*  and the profound hunger for change among voters that may explain both.
*  We turn as always to my colleague, Nate Cohn.
*  It's Tuesday, May 14th.
*  So Nate, welcome back.
*  Michael, thank you.
*  Always good to be here.
*  I want to start by asking you to explain something pretty basic, which is why we conduct so many
*  polls on the presidential race.
*  You were just on the show, I think about a month or so ago when the Times did...
*  Was it really that recently?
*  Yes.
*  It's the last big presidential poll.
*  What is different about this latest poll and why are we conducting it so closely on the
*  heels of our last presidential poll?
*  So one reason is that these are state polls of the battleground states, Pennsylvania,
*  Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia.
*  And the last poll was a national poll.
*  And as you know, the presidency is decided by the electoral college, not by the national
*  popular vote.
*  And as a result, we do need to drill down into these key swing states to understand
*  the course of the election.
*  And we haven't conducted any battleground state polls since November.
*  So it's actually been six months since the last time we looked at these key swing states.
*  And the second reason we pull so often is because a lot of things change.
*  Even since that last national poll, Donald Trump's trial began.
*  And it was important to us, by the way, to conduct that last national poll before the
*  trial began so that we had a marker of where the race stood heading into it.
*  And looking back over the longer term since those last state polls in November, so much
*  has changed not only in American politics, but also with respect to the economy and abroad.
*  The stock market's up 25% since October.
*  RFK has gotten on the ballot.
*  The primaries have wrapped up.
*  We've had six months of conflict in the Middle East.
*  American campaigns spent tens of millions of dollars of ads in these key states.
*  So there's a lot that's happened that we want to check in on.
*  Right.
*  And you can only measure the impact of changes like that by doing polling very frequently.
*  What about the question of what's different about this poll than any previous poll?
*  One thing that's different about this poll is that we're focused a lot more on the kind
*  of change the electorate wants for the country in this election.
*  By nature of these two very flawed candidates, we've spent a lot of time this year asking
*  about things like Joe Biden's age or Donald Trump's alleged criminal conduct.
*  And we haven't spent as much time focused on what voters want for the country, whether
*  on the issues or just in terms of their feeling about the direction of the country in general.
*  And after all of those polls showing Donald Trump in the lead, it sort of has raised the
*  question of, well, how much of this is about the personal attributes of the candidates
*  versus their desire to see something different in terms of policy in the White House?
*  OK, so with all that in mind, let's start with the top line
*  findings of this poll and then let's turn to this deeper understanding of voters' desire
*  for change that you sought to better understand through this new poll.
*  Well, despite all the political and economic changes the last six months that I was telling
*  you about, Michael, the top line result is kind of the same as it was six months ago.
*  Donald Trump still leads in five of the six states despite the improving economy, despite
*  tens of millions of dollars in campaign spending by the Biden campaign in the battleground
*  states, despite the end to the primary season and despite the beginning of the criminal
*  trial of Donald Trump in Manhattan.
*  In the poll, Donald Trump was ahead in Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,
*  among likely voters, while Joe Biden only led in one state among likely voters, Michigan.
*  OK, this is very important because these are all six states, swing states, that Biden won
*  in 2020, which is in large part why he became president in his last contest against Trump.
*  And you're saying Trump is ahead of Biden in five of those six states, which seems very,
*  very mathematically consequential.
*  That's right. Biden won all six of these states in 2020.
*  He would not have won the presidency if he lost five of the states.
*  And if the election were held today and if everywhere else stayed the same and these
*  poll results were right, Donald Trump would win a majority of the votes in the electoral
*  college. You know, it's worth emphasizing that Joe Biden doesn't need to win all of
*  these states to win the presidency.
*  He could win if he only won Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, provided he won
*  everywhere else that we didn't poll.
*  That would give him exactly 270 electoral votes.
*  Right. And the poll does show that Joe Biden is still competitive in those three
*  northern battlegrounds.
*  None of those states are outside of the margin of error.
*  Trump's lead is at its largest in Pennsylvania, where he's up by three points, but with six
*  months to go, you know, that's not necessarily a daunting hill to climb.
*  The place where Joe Biden seems to be in bigger trouble is in these more diverse Sunbelt
*  states, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, where Trump has a very substantial lead.
*  And that's a reflection of something that we've already talked about on the show
*  before, which is that Donald Trump is doing very well for a Republican among black,
*  Hispanic and young voters.
*  And that's doing a lot to improve his standing in these relatively diverse states.
*  Right. So given that this poll ultimately reinforces our sense that Biden's
*  reelection path is narrow and that many key groups have become disaffected with him.
*  What have you found on that question of change?
*  How much voters want change and how important that seems to the question of why Trump
*  is doing better than Biden in so many of these swing states?
*  Well, we asked voters a series of questions that at least I thought was pretty interesting.
*  You know, first we asked people what kind of change they want.
*  Do they think that the system needs no change, minor change, major change, or do we just
*  completely need to tear down the system in America today?
*  Then we asked them what kind of change they thought the candidates would provide using
*  the exact same language. You think that Donald Trump would change nothing, would he yield
*  minor changes, major changes, tear it down?
*  And so on asked the same question about Joe Biden.
*  And then finally, we also asked whether they thought the changes that these candidates
*  would provide would be good or bad.
*  You can imagine, for instance, a liberal who wants major changes and who also thinks
*  Donald Trump would provide major change, but doesn't like the change that Trump would
*  bring. Right. And at the end, we can then stitch all that together to sort of say, OK,
*  this is what voters want and this is what they think they get from these two candidates.
*  And, you know, I think what we found was pretty interesting.
*  I mean, at a high level, voters really want major changes.
*  Nearly 70 percent of voters in the poll said that the political and economic system in
*  the U.S. either needs major changes or needs to be torn down entirely.
*  And it's that extends across parties and across both Biden and Trump supporters and so
*  on. Wow. Obviously, different people have very different ideas of what kind of change
*  the system in the country needs, but they are united on believing that changes needed.
*  What voters thought about the candidates was sometimes quite a bit different than that.
*  Voters really didn't think that Joe Biden would bring very much change to the country.
*  More than anything, voters weren't really convinced anything would change.
*  If Joe Biden was president, a full 30 percent said nothing would change.
*  Nearly 40 percent said only minor changes would happen.
*  And even if they think he does provide minor changes, they don't even think his changes
*  would necessarily be good or bad. They just sort of see him as ineffectual.
*  Interesting. So Joe Biden is in the minds of voters, essentially a status quo candidate
*  who isn't going to shake things up at a time when they're looking for big changes.
*  Right. And you do not want to be the status quo candidate when 70 percent of those polled
*  say they want major or tear it down level of change.
*  Exactly. And Donald Trump, on the other hand, voters thought would provide major changes
*  or tear it down change.
*  Even many of Joe Biden supporters think that Donald Trump would bring major changes.
*  In fact, overall, 70 percent of voters thought Donald Trump would either bring major changes
*  or tear the system down, which is almost exactly what the country said it wanted in the first
*  place. 70 percent voters want major change.
*  70 percent say Donald Trump brings major change.
*  His anti-establishment outsider tear it all down pitch aligns relatively well with what
*  the electorate wants. It gets a little more complicated if we drill down into the details,
*  though, of the kind of change voters want and the kind of change they think Trump would
*  provide. But they're pretty split on whether the changes he'd provide would be good or bad.
*  Overall, 43 percent of voters think that Donald Trump would make good changes for the country
*  compared to 35 percent who think those changes would be bad.
*  So in every way, Trump seems to benefit from what this poll finds to be this deep hunger for change
*  in the electorate. I'm curious who the poll shows is seeking this change, what kind of voter and if
*  that voter was with Biden in 2020 when he won all these swing states and became president,
*  but who now see him as insufficient as an agent of change in this moment.
*  As I just mentioned, the voters who are looking for change span the political spectrum. They span
*  every ideology, every demographic group and so on. But the group of Biden voters who backed him last
*  time but say they won't support him again are disproportionately likely to be relatively
*  moderate or conservative young and nonwhite voters. The ones who identify as liberal are
*  mostly sticking by Joe Biden or at the very least are not supporting Donald Trump. So we have a sort
*  of unusual group of voters here, at least unusual in the way we usually think about American politics,
*  young black Latino voters who want big changes but don't think of themselves as liberals,
*  who think of themselves as moderate or even conservative. There's not a specific policy
*  program they're advocating. There's not a specific aspect of the system that they're looking to
*  critique. What distinguishes them is that they're so unhappy with the system that they demand major
*  changes or fundamental changes. And so unideological that they don't bring the sort of
*  clear left right views to the issues that keep voters with Joe Biden. If they were the sort of
*  person that felt strongly about Medicare for all, they probably really dislike Donald Trump on
*  ideological grounds. So you're looking for someone who has the same yearning for change,
*  but who does not have that kind of consistent view on the issues that binds them more clearly to the
*  Democratic Party. Got it. And when we ask them an open-ended questioning, you know, what's the most
*  important issue? Why are you voting for this candidate? Their answers remain sort of typical.
*  There's not anything that really stands out about them. They still are complaining about the economy
*  and immigration just like everyone else. It's just that they're just that much more frustrated
*  with the status quo that they're willing to defect. There's something very intuitive about
*  Trump's appeal to a voter like this, because if you're not especially ideological and you crave
*  deep change, I can't think of any candidate in our political system in a generation who
*  more embodies the idea of change, much of it pretty radical than Donald Trump.
*  Yeah, I think that's right. I think if you were looking for another candidate in recent
*  memory, you'd probably have to go back to Barack Obama, at least in the general election, another
*  candidate who famously represented change, change we could believe in. He was also kind of not
*  necessarily the clearest candidate on ideological grounds, right? He was a relative moderate on some
*  issues and had appeal to certain kinds of Republicans in the 2008 election. And I think that
*  it's not a coincidence that there are so many Obama Trump voters out there, right? There is a
*  way in which both of these candidates, despite disagreeing on so much, nonetheless have figured
*  out a way to channel the critique of the status quo, critique of the establishment and a desire
*  for change into a political message. Even if the content that supports that message is very
*  different, that message in itself has appeal to a certain kind of person. Right. And quite
*  relevantly for our conversation here, Nate, Obama very famously in electoral terms created a coalition
*  that was very successful in winning over young black and Latino voters. And in what we'd have to call
*  a historic change, it is now Trump, a Republican who seems to be disassembling that coalition
*  that was once this hard earned prize of the Democratic Party and kind of taking it and making
*  it his own, it looks like for 2024. I think that's such a good point, Michael. And I don't
*  think it's a coincidence that in our poll, the groups that yearn for the most fundamental
*  changes to American society are the classic Obama coalition constituencies of young black and Hispanic
*  voters. And they're also the groups that Joe Biden is losing the most ground among. I mean,
*  if we just think about Biden and Obama for a second, the case for Obama to represent change was
*  clear in every respect, every element of his biography, his personal characteristics
*  represented change, his brand of politics after 35 years of Reagan conservatism represented a
*  clear departure from the status quo. And now today it's the reverse. Joe Biden represents
*  sort of demographics of the past. He's an old white male from Scranton. He's also no longer
*  fundamentally a change candidate. At least four years ago when Donald Trump was president, Joe
*  Biden could represent change when he was challenging Donald Trump in the White House. At the time,
*  the country was in the depths of the pandemic. There was unrest in the wake of the death of
*  George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests. The economy was doing terribly.
*  So Joe Biden in arguing for a different approach on the pandemic and for racial conciliation,
*  he could represent a real change from the status quo, even though he wasn't in any way
*  a deeply radical candidate. Now those aren't the issues that voters are focused on. It's not even
*  obvious what his second term agenda is to me. I mean, he wants to win this election on democracy
*  and abortion, but those are efforts to sort of protect the things that we used to take for
*  granted, not ways to improve the country and bring it to a new progressive frontier.
*  Got it. Biden was just enough change in 2020 and nowhere near enough right now for a meaningful
*  number of the voters that you polled in these key swing states. That's right. Biden does not
*  represent change. Donald Trump absolutely does represent change. And while you might expect
*  that the same desire for change would affect other candidates and other races elsewhere on the ballot,
*  that just doesn't seem to be the case, which tells us that this is almost entirely isolated
*  to the presidential contest. We'll be right back.
*  Nate, before the break, you were describing how this latest New York Times poll of battleground
*  states in the presidential race, lets us see how much the question of change and how it advantages
*  Trump and disadvantages Biden is isolated to the presidential race rather than races elsewhere
*  in these battleground states. So just explain that and tell us precisely what the poll found.
*  Well, we asked voters how they thought about four races for US Senate in these states,
*  Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona. Three of those four states
*  featured democratic incumbents. And in all four of these states, the democratic candidate let,
*  sometimes even by a comfortable margin. And even though Donald Trump was ahead in the presidential
*  race. So here we have these democratic incumbents weighed down by many of the same problems as Mr.
*  Biden. But it's only in the presidential race where we see this yielding a breakthrough
*  for the Republicans at this stage. Give us an example that really illustrates this.
*  Yeah, I think ground zero is Nevada. Of all the states we pulled, Nevada was Joe Biden's worst.
*  It's the youngest and most diverse of the battleground states. And Donald Trump led by a
*  staggering 12 points among registered voters in this poll. This is a state that Joe Biden won by
*  two points in 2020. But in the race for US Senate, things looked basically normal. The Democrat,
*  Jackie Rosen, an incumbent senator, but not a juggernaut, not someone who has routinely
*  excelled in her previous election contest. She was leading by two points. And young and nonwhite
*  voters lined up behind Ms. Rosen in the usual unexpected proportions with her winning among
*  18 to 29 year olds and Hispanics by a wide margin, even as Mr. Trump led those groups.
*  In the presidential race. Right. This becomes therefore a very potent way of isolating Biden's
*  weaknesses because fellow incumbents from the same party, as you said, in pretty much the same
*  position facing the same headwinds and forces are beating him quite meaningfully in the case of
*  Nevada. And that makes me wonder, do these Democratic incumbent Senate candidates just do a
*  better job of embodying voters desires for change than Biden or in your estimation, is it more
*  complicated than that? Well, as I just alluded to, many of these Senate Democrats are not political
*  juggernauts. We're not talking about Senator Bernie Sanders or Senator Barack Obama in 2006.
*  We're talking about relatively generic Democrats who have no special case to be agents for change
*  or no path to being presidential candidates in 2028 or something like that. So I don't think
*  it's that they embody change in some basic way. I think it is instead about voters holding Joe
*  Biden responsible for so many of the problems with the status quo, whether that's inflation or the
*  border. I also think it's worth remembering Donald Trump as a variable here. He's not some unknown
*  Senate challenger. This is someone with a really unique brand for a Republican. He, in a way that
*  is not true for other Republicans, is seen as someone who would shake up the system, who's
*  against the establishment. He's also someone who has a demonstrated record of success on the economy
*  in the minds of most voters, which they say is the most important issue. So I would keep Donald
*  Trump as having unique strengths with respect to Biden's vulnerabilities as being an important
*  factor here as well. Right. This may, of course, also be a measure of the fact that the Republicans
*  challenging these Democratic incumbents just aren't all that well known and definitely not
*  well known enough to embody any kind of change. That's right. And for many of these voters,
*  these Senate races between a reasonably well-known Democrat and an unknown Republican are just sort
*  of opportunities to express your default partisan preferences. When you don't know anything about
*  anyone and you're a Democrat, you vote for the Democrat. So those young Black and Hispanic voters
*  who are defecting from the Democrats to Trump in the presidential race, they're sticking by their
*  default, normal, Democratic partisan political preference in these Senate races. So here we
*  have further evidence of Biden's somewhat unique weakness in this race. And speaking of battleground
*  states and potential risks to President Biden, something else has happened since you last pulled
*  these battleground states in the fall that feels pretty important. You referenced at the very
*  beginning of our conversation, that is the fact that RFK Jr., Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has gotten
*  himself on the ballot in at least one of these swing states. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hails
*  from Democratic royalty. He wanted to run as a Democrat, but ultimately decided to run as an
*  independent. So the assumption has been that he would pose the greatest threat to Biden. I wonder
*  if this latest poll shows that to be the case. It does not show that to be the case, Michael. It
*  does show him receiving a pretty substantial amount of support. He won 10% of the vote
*  when we named RFK on the ballot, which if it were to hold up in the final result would be the
*  strongest performance by a third party candidate since Ross Perot. But the poll did not find
*  that Kennedy drew disproportionately from Biden voters. In fact, slightly more of Donald Trump's
*  supporters were likelier to say that they would prefer RFK on the ballot than Biden supporters.
*  How do you make sense of that? Well, there's a group of voters that voted for Biden in 2020,
*  and lean Democratic that no longer like Joe Biden. We've been talking about them for much of the
*  episode in fact, right? Right. Many of those voters say that they will vote for Donald Trump
*  this November. But many of those voters who voted for Biden last time, and you say that they'll
*  vote for Trump would actually rather vote for RFK, which makes some sense, right? They voted for Biden
*  last time. How much can they really like Donald Trump? But as a consequence, RFK is winning a
*  group of voters who backs Trump narrowly in 2024, but backed Biden pretty significantly in 2020.
*  And that sort of complicates the narrative about how we talk about this group. Imagine someone who
*  voted for Biden four years ago, and who now wants to vote for Donald Trump, the sort of person who
*  wants change, traditionally Democratic that we've talked about all episode. Many of those voters
*  would rather vote for RFK than Donald Trump, which makes some sense. They didn't vote for
*  him last time. They don't love the guy. But as a consequence, the RFK vote is slightly
*  disproportionately coming from people who would prefer Trump in this election, but simultaneously
*  backed Biden quite overwhelmingly in the last election. So we're talking about a group of voters
*  that Biden really needed to win last time, but that he isn't winning right now. So in our poll
*  today, he's not really affecting the race, even though there are people who are pretty important
*  to Biden last time. So Nate, if I'm understanding you correctly, and this is admittedly pretty
*  complicated, there's a group of voters here voted for Biden in 2020. And either way, they're not
*  going to vote for him again in 2024. Not in the poll right now. Yep. Instead, they're likely to
*  vote for RFK instead of defecting to Trump. Is that good for Biden? Is it better for Biden in
*  a swing state to have a voter who once was with him go to RFK instead of Trump? So I guess I have
*  two answers here. The first answer is right now, Biden is not doing well enough for RFK to be a
*  problem because Biden is doing so badly among these people who ought to be Democrats that it
*  doesn't make a difference whether they're voting for RFK or Trump. That said, if we can imagine a
*  world in the future where Joe Biden hypothetically mounted a comeback, where alternately Donald Trump
*  collapsed because he was convicted of federal crimes, in that scenario where Joe Biden was
*  strong enough to win like he was four years ago, then I think RFK might actually hurt him at that
*  point. Fascinating. So I want to turn to another factor that has entered this presidential race,
*  and that is the Israeli military operation in Gaza and America's support for Israel in this war,
*  especially President Biden's support for this war, which as we know from covering it so much on the
*  show, has triggered tremendous amount of left-wing activism, especially among young voters who
*  President Biden is struggling to win over. Does the poll reflect the conflict in Gaza as a problem
*  for President Biden? I think it does, Michael. You know, if we focus again on these voters who
*  have swung against Joe Biden, the people who voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 election, but don't do
*  so anymore, 13% of those voters said the most important issue to them was either foreign policy
*  or something about the war in the Middle East, like they said Israel or wars or Gaza,
*  and almost none of those voters said that they were more sympathetic to Israel than the Palestinians
*  in the conflict. Most were sympathizers with Palestinians. 13%, that's a pretty big chunk of
*  the voters who Biden is struggling with, but that's a much higher proportion than it is among the whole
*  electorate. So most voters don't seem to care very much about foreign policy or Israel, but those who
*  do are pretty likely to have flipped. Got it. One thing that's worth noting is that Joe Biden's
*  challenge on this issue is especially pronounced among voters who were either Muslim or who said
*  they were of Middle Eastern or North African ancestry, and nearly all of those who flipped
*  said that the war in the Middle East and foreign policy were most important to their vote.
*  Now, it's interesting because I mentioned earlier that this is still a small segment of the electorate,
*  and despite all of those challenges, Joe Biden is still ahead in Michigan. In fact,
*  it's the only state he leads in, even though it's the state where these voters represent
*  the largest share of the electorate. So it's a great illustration of how what we're talking about
*  something that clearly is affecting a sliver of voters and even a pretty substantial chunk, 13%
*  of those who have defected from Joe Biden, and yet even in the single state where Muslim, Middle
*  Eastern, North African voters represent the largest share of the electorate, it's still not
*  necessarily enough to single-handedly determine the outcome. So Nate, we've covered a lot of ground
*  in this conversation about this latest New York Times presidential campaign poll, and I just want
*  to conclude by having you, as best you can, kind of draw it all together by giving us your
*  higher-level thoughts about the meaning of what you learned from this survey.
*  I think my high-level takeaway is that with six months to go, voters are deeply dissatisfied with
*  the direction of the country, and they want to do something very different than what they have now.
*  And that's a really tough spot if you're an incumbent president who doesn't represent change,
*  and you only really have a couple of paths to pull it off. One option is that you have to figure out
*  a way to get Americans to be happy with where the country is going. Basically that we're on track.
*  I know we're not there yet, but we're on the way, is the general way that you can imagine Joe Biden
*  trying to thread a needle of a country yearning for something different without really believing
*  that Joe Biden can single-handedly alter the course of American history. And while we've
*  talked a lot about Joe Biden's vulnerabilities, we haven't talked very much about Donald Trump's
*  problems in this poll and alternately the opportunities that may present themselves
*  to Joe Biden as the campaign gets underway. Voters are overwhelmingly in favor of abortion
*  rights in the battleground states. They don't like Donald Trump much either. A majority of voters
*  have an unfavorable view of him. But right now the electorate is thinking mostly about how unsatisfied
*  it is with the status quo, and it's yearning for something different. And to the extent that over
*  the final six months, Joe Biden can refocus voters on Donald Trump's liabilities, get them to feel a
*  little bit better about where the country's going, maybe that still offers a route to a comeback.
*  Because as we just mentioned, many of these voters are still voting for Democratic Senate
*  candidates, and many of them aren't even tuned in yet. It's still a long way to go. And if you
*  really step back, Donald Trump should already be winning this election by a huge amount, given just
*  how unpopular Joe Biden is and given how many young and non-white voters have defected
*  away from the Democratic side. If Nikki Haley was the Republican nominee, this election maybe could
*  have been a landslide. In fact, in our last time, see, on a poll of these same states,
*  Nikki Haley was posting double-digit leads in Wisconsin. Right. Essentially what you have
*  found in this poll, Nate, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that this is shaping up to be a change
*  election where Donald Trump is the clear change agent. But he's also such a fundamentally flawed
*  agent of change that the question is going to become, do enough voters think he's willing
*  to reelect for the change? And are they willing to accept all the flaws?
*  That's right. And you know, it's worth remembering the thing that we always mention as a caveat,
*  but is so, so serious. There are six months to go until the election. The campaign is just heating
*  up. There are conventions and vice presidential picks and possibly convictions and debates still
*  ahead. We don't know how that is going to change what the electorate is focused on.
*  But right now we know that they're deeply dissatisfied and taking it out on Joe Biden.
*  Whether that's what they'll be thinking in six months, we just don't know. And the Biden
*  campaign will do everything that's power to try and change that. I don't know what is ultimately
*  going to happen, but I think that it at least sets out the roadmap, the playing field as we enter
*  the heart of the campaign season.
*  Well, Nate, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In damning testimony during Donald Trump's hush money trial,
*  Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, testified that Trump personally directed him to pay off a
*  porn star and personally approved the deceptive reimbursement plan at the center of the criminal
*  case. Cohen testified that Stormy Daniels' plan to publicize her account of having sex with Trump
*  was a quote catastrophic threat to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. As a result, Cohen said,
*  Trump ordered him to silence Daniels. Cohen recalled Trump telling him, quote,
*  just take care of it, an order that Cohen said he then carried out.
