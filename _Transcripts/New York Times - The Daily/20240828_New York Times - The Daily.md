# The War That Won’t End
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6cuRntb8l0)
*  From The New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Israel has been fighting Hamas in Gaza for almost a year.
*  But despite catastrophic losses, Hamas seems no closer to declaring defeat.
*  And despite considerable military gains, Israel seems no closer to declaring victory.
*  Today, my colleague Patrick Kingsley on why the war in Gaza is still going and what it would take to end it.
*  It's Wednesday, August 28th.
*  So Patrick, we wanted to hear from you in Israel today because we're coming up nearly on a year since October 7th.
*  And it really feels like every week you write at least one story about the ceasefire negotiations.
*  Some weeks it looks like progress toward a ceasefire deal, other weeks no progress.
*  Meanwhile, the threat of a wider war in the Middle East is deepening.
*  Just this weekend, there was a huge exchange of rocket fire in Israel's northern border with Lebanon.
*  That doesn't seem likely to end while the war in Gaza is still going.
*  So we all felt like it was really time to come to you and ask a basic question, which is why can't they agree to a ceasefire?
*  And perhaps more fundamentally, why is this war in Gaza still going on?
*  So these are very good questions.
*  Both the questions come down to two men, essentially.
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yahya Sinwar of Hamas.
*  And to understand why they have such fundamentally mutually exclusive positions on the war,
*  we have to start with the ceasefire, which is the most basic building block for stopping the war.
*  And the two leaders have a fundamental disagreement here.
*  Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, essentially wants a temporary ceasefire.
*  Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, wants a permanent ceasefire.
*  So Patrick, explain that. Start maybe with Netanyahu. Explain that position.
*  So for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the professed goal of the war is to destroy Hamas,
*  to destroy this group that invaded Israel on October 7th,
*  more than a thousand people, and abducted roughly 250.
*  And key members of his far-right coalition will accept nothing less than Hamas' total defeat.
*  Netanyahu needs that far-right coalition to stay in power.
*  And so if the ceasefire is temporary, it will allow him to present the truce to his base
*  as just a brief measure to free some of the roughly 100 hostages still left inside Gaza,
*  after which Israel can easily return to the fighting and to defeating Hamas.
*  So it will allow him to get some of the hostages back,
*  thus placating the many Israelis whose top priority is the release of the hostages.
*  And it will take away some of Hamas' key bargaining chips,
*  and it would allow him to say to his base that don't worry,
*  the war will continue and Hamas will be defeated after this brief pause in hostilities.
*  And what's the calculation for Sinwar? Walk us through his reasons for pushing through a permanent ceasefire.
*  Well, if he goes for a temporary one, he gives up key bargaining chips,
*  the Israeli hostages who Hamas captured on October 7th,
*  and he doesn't get much in return.
*  He doesn't secure Hamas' survival, and he leaves open the possibility that fighting will resume,
*  that Israel will continue its campaign after a few weeks,
*  and will continue to erode Hamas' fighting capability and governing capability,
*  and eventually secure its defeat.
*  A permanent ceasefire, by contrast, essentially allows Hamas to survive the war intact
*  as a political movement intact as a depleted but still active governing force that controls Gaza.
*  It may not be enough to save his life,
*  Israel will probably pursue him for the rest of his days,
*  but it allows Hamas as a movement to survive the war.
*  Okay, so these sides are pretty dug in on their respective very far apart positions,
*  but of course talks have been bumping along, right?
*  And they are bumping along with the help of the United States and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
*  What, if anything, has the U.S. involvement in the talks meant for this process?
*  The U.S. has brought key energy at times when it feels like both the sides,
*  Israel and Hamas, and the mediators, Egypt and Qatar,
*  have lacked energy, political will or desire to sit down at a negotiating table.
*  In particular, they've been trying to bridge the gaps between the different sides,
*  and their main approach has been a kind of constructive ambiguity
*  in the language that is written in the draft agreements that the two sides have been haggling over.
*  What does that mean exactly, constructive ambiguity?
*  It means having enough fluidity in the language of the deal
*  so that both sides can sell the agreement to their bases
*  as something that achieves what those bases want.
*  So in other words, not be so forensic in the wording of the agreement,
*  like keeping the language loose enough so that both sides can sell it to their populations.
*  So this is essentially a political fix the U.S. is trying to bring here.
*  Exactly. And just to give an example of how that constructive ambiguity in the language worked,
*  at one point in the negotiation there was a standoff over the extent to which
*  Israel would retain a military presence along a particular thoroughfare
*  dividing northern Gaza from southern Gaza.
*  Israel wanted to maintain checkpoints there to stop Hamas moving weapons between those two areas.
*  Hamas didn't and doesn't want Israeli checkpoints in that location.
*  So the way that the negotiators bridged that gap, at least at one point,
*  was to include the principle of that idea within the draft agreement,
*  but not the enforcement mechanism by which that plan would be enacted.
*  And that would have allowed the Israeli leadership Netanyahu to go back to his right-wing base
*  and say, no, the principle of preventing Gazans from moving weapons around Gaza has been maintained.
*  And it would have allowed Hamas to argue internally that, well, yes, that principle is in there,
*  but there is nothing mentioned in that draft agreement about an enforcement mechanism.
*  Right. There's no checkpoints there. What checkpoints are you talking about?
*  We are free to move.
*  Exactly. But then in July, we got a window into how this constructive ambiguity doesn't quite work.
*  While the two sides seem to have agreed on this ambiguous terminology in May,
*  by July, two months later, Israel had come back with a new demand to replace that ambiguity with greater clarity.
*  They wanted clarity on that principle of stopping Gazans from moving around the territory with guns could be enforced.
*  And of course, that removed the ambiguity and remained something that Hamas does not want to agree to,
*  and it is one of many stumbling blocks that is preventing a deal between the two sides.
*  OK, so from all we can tell, the talks are not working, or at least they're proving very cumbersome as you're laying out here.
*  But let's talk about how wars normally end, which is that one side admits it can no longer win.
*  And in this case, that would appear to be Hamas.
*  I mean, as of this month, 40,000 Gazans were dead, according to Gazan health officials,
*  and vast swaths of its territory are in ruins.
*  So why doesn't all of that add up to Hamas viewing this as a defeat?
*  Well, that's a very reasonable question, because when you look at Gaza and you see all the astonishing destruction,
*  more than half the house is damaged, tens of thousands of people killed,
*  huge harm to infrastructure and to the health system.
*  You do wonder why doesn't Hamas surrender in most other wars aside that is lost materially to this extent,
*  would have surrendered by this point.
*  But this is not a normal war.
*  The sides have very unusual thresholds for victory.
*  Israel has a very high threshold for victory.
*  Its leader Netanyahu says he wants the total destruction of Hamas.
*  Hamas has a very low threshold for victory.
*  It just wants to survive.
*  And neither threshold is very typical.
*  Usually when one side so convincingly destroys another, think of Japan in 1945, the Japanese surrendered.
*  Alternatively, if you look at other moments in the Second World War when France realized it was losing,
*  its leaders did not wait for the total destruction of France to either flee or give in.
*  And what we have here is we have a side that by conventional measures is losing,
*  but doesn't want to surrender because its own threshold for victory is so low
*  that it kind of thinks that it might actually be winning.
*  So for Hamas, as long as it has one fighter standing essentially,
*  it's still in the war and hasn't lost the war. It's still going.
*  Exactly. And what makes all this doubly unconventional is the fact that the Israeli army
*  is itself not fighting in a particularly normal way.
*  It is not holding the territory that it conquers.
*  And what that means is they are not controlling Gaza,
*  despite the fact that they have captured most of it by now at some point during the last 10 months.
*  And because they haven't established control,
*  that leads to this very bizarre form of whack-a-mole
*  where Israel goes into an area, has a very destructive battle with Hamas,
*  leaves, Hamas returns, forcing Israel to come back,
*  fighting a second, sometimes a third and a fourth time,
*  and still then abandoning its control, retreating again to key strategic positions
*  within Gaza or even within Israel.
*  And the whole cycle begins again.
*  So it leads to extraordinary destruction,
*  but it doesn't particularly lead to a change in who actually controls Gaza on the ground.
*  And Patrick, why don't they occupy the areas that they've taken?
*  Well, we should say here that for a lot of Palestinians, Israel never stopped occupying Gaza.
*  They maintained a physical presence inside Gaza between 1967 and 2005,
*  when Israeli soldiers and Israeli settlers left the territory.
*  But ever since, they've still maintained some degree of control over trade,
*  the airspace, the phone networks, entry and exit.
*  The debate among Israelis is whether they should go back to maintaining a physical presence
*  as they did until 2005.
*  And for the moment, those opposed to that physical presence seem to have worn out.
*  Why? Because installing soldiers throughout Gaza is really difficult.
*  It requires vast amounts of resources.
*  It's complicated and it's also dangerous.
*  It has to be protected by thousands of Israeli soldiers.
*  They can be killed at any time if you try and hang on to a territory the size of Gaza.
*  And because of that, it seems like Israel's leadership
*  does not want to entertain that possibility, at least for now,
*  if there are people within government and in vast ways of the Israeli right-wing public
*  that would actually like to see Israel return to building military bases across Gaza Strip.
*  So if the situation on the ground won't end the war
*  and a ceasefire seems improbable, at least for now,
*  then how does the war end?
*  That is starting to become the key question.
*  How do these two sides get out of this war?
*  How do they find a way through what feels like it has become an intractable situation?
*  And it's beginning to feel like we're going to need some kind of game changer,
*  something maybe we haven't quite conceived up so far,
*  a black swan event that is going to shift the tectonic plates
*  of how this conflict is being fought.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, we're at this current impasse,
*  in large part because of these two leaders and their political calculations.
*  And it feels like maybe only something really big could change things, as you're saying.
*  What sort of game changer are we talking about?
*  Well, there's a few different things that could shift the needle.
*  One could be in the U.S.
*  One could be with the Israelis
*  and one could be a regional war that would change the dynamic across the Middle East.
*  So maybe start with the United States, which is obviously coming up on a big election.
*  Exactly. And whoever wins that election,
*  we will be left at the end of it with a different president
*  and that different president could have a slightly different focus and attitude
*  to, if not Israel itself, then the way that Israel is prosecuting this war.
*  And that might in turn change Benjamin Netanyahu's calculations at the negotiation table.
*  Right. What else?
*  Another wild card would be the killing of Yahya Sinema,
*  the leader of Hamas.
*  That is perhaps Israel's top goal in Gaza right now.
*  They've killed several other key leaders of Hamas.
*  Yahya Sinema is the last man standing, essentially.
*  If he goes, if the leader of Hamas goes,
*  that would allow Benjamin Netanyahu to say to his base,
*  mission accomplished.
*  And that in turn might allow him to agree to a ceasefire
*  under terms that he previously hadn't agreed to.
*  In other words, the far-right leaders in his coalition
*  perhaps would be satisfied if Sinema was killed.
*  Exactly. And on the other side of the border,
*  it's possible that with Sinema dead,
*  with the most powerful leader within Hamas dead,
*  his subordinates would be more likely to compromise,
*  to surrender in his absence.
*  Of course, that's a big if, and it's very possible
*  that Sinema's death would not actually change
*  their thinking on a ceasefire or on the war itself,
*  all that much. But the possibility remains.
*  And Patrick, what about the pressure on Netanyahu
*  and the Israeli government on the part of the hostage families?
*  Just on Tuesday, one hostage was actually freed.
*  So does this pressure, you know, the protests,
*  everything we've been seeing, amount to some sort of
*  game-changing dynamic for Netanyahu?
*  I don't think it's game-changing.
*  For a start, it's been going on for a while
*  and it obviously hasn't shifted his calculations thus far.
*  And secondly, it's interesting you mentioned this hostage rescue
*  on Tuesday, because for some, that actually supports
*  Netanyahu's argument that it's only through
*  more military action that you can free the hostages.
*  Not a truce, but further action on the ground
*  by the Israeli military in Gaza.
*  And while it's true that there are lots of protesters
*  calling for Netanyahu, for the Israeli government
*  to prioritize the hostages' well-being
*  and to cut the deal basically at any price
*  in order to get the hostages home,
*  the people who are pushing most loudly for that deal
*  are not Netanyahu's own supporters.
*  His base, their priority is Hamas' defeat.
*  And while they may care about the hostages
*  and want them home at some point,
*  their release is not their first priority.
*  And Patrick, you mentioned regional war
*  as something that could potentially shift the dynamic here.
*  Talk to me about that.
*  Well, alongside the Gaza war, we also have
*  smaller, simmering conflicts between Israel
*  and Hamas' allies across the region.
*  Those are Hezbollah in Lebanon,
*  the Houthis in Yemen,
*  and the benefactor of all those three groups, Iran.
*  And to varying degrees, those proxies of Iran
*  and Iran itself have been fighting
*  this low-level conflict against Israel
*  in parallel with the Gaza war since October.
*  Now, at any moment,
*  all these smaller conflicts could erupt
*  into much bigger ones.
*  If either side, if Israel makes a mistake
*  or a miscalculation, if Hezbollah makes a mistake
*  or a miscalculation, Iran the same,
*  then these conflicts could erupt into an all-out regional war
*  involving all these actors firing on full cylinders.
*  So far, no side has appeared truly willing to do that.
*  They've always stepped back from the brink,
*  and on Sunday we saw Hezbollah and Israel doing exactly that.
*  But if it does escalate into an all-out regional war,
*  then that would at the very least consume Israel's energies,
*  draw down its resources, its munitions supply,
*  and possibly make Israel much likelier
*  to agree to a truce in Gaza
*  in order to get all of these conflicts to wind down.
*  And how would a regional war change the calculations for Sinwar?
*  The feeling is that Sinwar would benefit from a regional war.
*  A regional war would distract Israel
*  and potentially even endanger the existence of the Israeli state,
*  depending on how long and how intense that war got.
*  All of this benefits Hamas and all of it benefits Sinwar
*  because the weaker the Israeli state is,
*  the more likely it is to compromise
*  in ceasefire negotiations with Hamas
*  and agree to something that Sinwar thinks is more favorable
*  to Hamas's long-term survival.
*  And presumably, on the most extreme scenario,
*  the destruction of Israel is something
*  that would be growing toward
*  and a big regional war would raise the specter of that.
*  It would certainly increase its chances a notch or two.
*  Israel is a very strong state.
*  It has perhaps the strongest military in the Middle East
*  and it would take a lot to dislodge its presence in the region.
*  But Hamas has never rescinded the call it made
*  in its founding charter to destroy Israel.
*  And anything that makes Israel less safe
*  would be construed by Hamas
*  and it would be a very strong enemy of Israel.
*  Now, interestingly, there are those who believe
*  that the Israelis themselves, or some Israelis,
*  are also seeking a regional war.
*  Why?
*  Well, by this theory, it would create the pretext
*  by which Israel could attack Iran
*  in a much more brazen and intense way
*  than it ever previously has done.
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu and many Israelis
*  are concerned about this and they fear
*  that the nuclear weapons program that Iran is working on
*  is a much more existential threat to Israel
*  than anything Hamas or other Palestinians
*  might throw at the Israeli population.
*  And therefore, by this argument,
*  some Israeli leaders, perhaps Netanyahu himself,
*  is searching for a pretext to hit Iran hard
*  to destroy that nuclear capacity
*  and perhaps even drag in the U.S.,
*  into a regional war that it doesn't seek
*  but would be forced to join in order to defend
*  its key Middle Eastern ally.
*  And all of that would create the pretext
*  and the opportunity to destroy Iran's nuclear capability.
*  So, as much as many Israelis and Palestinians
*  are desperately looking for a way
*  to end this war, there are people on either side
*  who have reasons to not just continue the war
*  but also escalate it into an all-out regional conflict.
*  I mean, it's remarkable.
*  We started this conversation by talking about
*  these two men, their political ambitions
*  and why it's making it difficult for them
*  to get to a ceasefire.
*  But we're ending it in a place where
*  it seems not only are they not wanting to get to a ceasefire
*  but potentially they actually want the war to get bigger.
*  They're not going away from conflict issues
*  and they're not just trying to get there
*  but running toward it.
*  That's a possibility.
*  We can't know what either man is thinking exactly.
*  We're not inside their heads.
*  What we can say for sure though is that
*  both Israel and Hamas, and by extension
*  both Netanyahu and Sinwar, are still involved
*  in negotiations for a ceasefire.
*  Those negotiations do not currently seem
*  to be going well.
*  There was a big meeting on Sunday
*  between senior officials from Israel
*  and the mediating countries.
*  The possibility of a ceasefire very much remains
*  even if the chances of an all-out regional war
*  are also growing.
*  Patrick, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  On Wednesday, hundreds of Israeli troops
*  mounted a major military operation
*  in the West Bank
*  targeting Palestinian militants in the occupied territory
*  where nearly three million Palestinians live
*  under Israeli military rule.
*  The operation followed months of escalating Israeli raids
*  in the area, and Israeli officials said
*  that at least nine people had been killed.
*  Hamas denounced the operation,
*  accusing Israel of expanding the war in Gaza.
*  As of Wednesday morning, the operation was ongoing.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, Donald Trump announced plans
*  to name his former rival, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
*  along with former U.S. Representative
*  Tulsi Gabbard, as honorary co-chairs
*  of his presidential transition team.
*  The team, which includes Trump's sons
*  as well as his running mate, J.D. Vance,
*  would help him select the policies and personnel
*  for a second Trump term.
*  The appointments were a bid by Trump
*  to show that his support extends beyond party lines.
*  Both Kennedy and Gabbard spent most of their public lives
*  as progressives,
*  and both started their presidential runs as Democrats.
*  Kennedy ended his independent campaign for president last week
*  and endorsed Trump.
*  Gabbard has since left the Democratic Party
*  and rebranded herself as a celebrity
*  among Trump's base of support.
*  And...
*  Special Counsel Jack Smith revised his indictment
*  accusing former President Donald Trump
*  of plotting to overturn the 2020 election
*  in an effort to help it survive the Supreme Court's recent ruling
*  granting former presidents immunity
*  for official acts in office.
*  In its decision on immunity,
*  the Supreme Court ruled that a president's dealings
*  with the Justice Department
*  are considered official duties of his office.
*  Smith's revised charging documents
*  exclude the accusations
*  that Trump conspired with Justice Department officials
*  to support his false claims
*  that the election had been stolen from him.
