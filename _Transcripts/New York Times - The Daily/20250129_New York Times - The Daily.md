Video Description: In one of his most audacious moves since taking office, President Trump ordered a freeze on Tuesday on trillions of dollars in federal money — from anti-poverty programs to foreign aid — in order to purge the government of what he called woke ideology.


Michael D. Shear, a White House correspondent for The New York Times, discusses the order, the chaos it prompted and whether it is likely to survive in court.


Guests: Michael D. Shear (https://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-d-shear) , a White House correspondent for The New York Times.


Background reading: 

  •  A judge stayed President Trump’s freeze (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-freeze-funding.html) , but disruption to the Medicaid funding system caused fear.
  •  Uncertainty around the freeze also caused chaos in education (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/schools-panic-trump-federal-pause.html) .

# Trump Freezes Trillions. Chaos Ensues.
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=0.0s)]
*  This week, President Donald Trump made one of the most audacious moves since he took [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=14.24s)]
*  office, freezing trillions of dollars in federal money, everything from anti-poverty programs [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=18.48s)]
*  to foreign aid, in order to purge the government of what he called woke ideology. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=23.88s)]
*  Today, my colleague White House reporter Mike Shearer, on that order, the chaos that it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=30.96s)]
*  prompted and whether it is likely to survive in court. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=37.2s)]
*  It's Wednesday, January 29th. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=41.2s)]
*  So Mike, President Trump has done something pretty remarkable. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=65.88s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can lay out for listeners exactly what he did and what's unfolded in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=70.32s)]
*  the day since. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=79.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=80.32s)]
*  It really was remarkable. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=81.32s)]
*  Essentially, late in the day on Monday, President Trump's budget office, which is called the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=82.6s)]
*  Office of Management and Budget, it reports directly to the president, they put out a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=87.32s)]
*  memo, a really short memo. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=91.72s)]
*  It was just two pages, but it essentially exploded in Washington the minute it went [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=92.84s)]
*  out, because what it did was it said that every single federal program that involves [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=97.76s)]
*  the delivery of money in the form of a grant or in the form of a loan to any organization, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=105.56s)]
*  any entity across the country had to be paused. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  And I'm just going to read directly from the memo and it said, the use of federal [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism and Green New Deal social engineering policies [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=123.84s)]
*  is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day to day lives of those we serve. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=131.04s)]
*  It said that all of the agencies had to pause the funds while they reviewed whether the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=137.36s)]
*  programs in question, the loans and the grants, were, quote, consistent with the president's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=141.52s)]
*  policies. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  So, basically, the memo is saying all these federal funds go out to all of these programs [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=148.64s)]
*  all over the country. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=153.92s)]
*  They need to be put on hold to make sure that none of them are actually at odds with the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=155.6s)]
*  administration's agenda. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=161.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=162.6s)]
*  And this is a lot of money, according to the administration's own figures, as much as $3 [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=163.6s)]
*  trillion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=168.72s)]
*  And the agenda that the memo says these programs must adhere to was really laid out by the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=169.72s)]
*  in a series of executive orders that we've all seen him announce over the course of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=176.28s)]
*  eight or nine days that he's been in office. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=181.28s)]
*  And we know what those executive orders have tried to do, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=183.6s)]
*  Root out wokeness in the government, as the president would put it, and really align all [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=186.84s)]
*  of the government's spending with this sort of MAGA agenda that seeks to kind of wipe [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=191.88s)]
*  out some of the efforts that have been made by previous administrations over the past [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  several years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=201.28s)]
*  So exactly how does the memo propose that this is going to work? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=202.72s)]
*  What the memo says is that over the course of the next two weeks, starting Tuesday at [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=206.6s)]
*  five p.m., all of these federal agencies are supposed to fill out a spreadsheet. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=212.76s)]
*  The spreadsheet has every single federal grant and federal loan. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=218.84s)]
*  And apparently what the Office of Management and Budget will do is essentially go through [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=223.8s)]
*  that spreadsheet. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=228.76s)]
*  If they find programs that don't violate the orders that the president has done, those [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=230.0s)]
*  will be safe. The funding will continue. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=235.84s)]
*  But that in some fashion, if they identify the programs that they think are funding things [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=237.92s)]
*  that President Trump would not want to fund or are blocked by these executive orders, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=244.28s)]
*  that funding would be then at risk. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=249.24s)]
*  So which programs exactly will be affected here? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=251.92s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=255.4s)]
*  Well, the memo is quite broad and it's clear that it is intended to cover the vast sweep [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  of most government programs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=261.36s)]
*  There's literally hundreds and hundreds of grant programs and federal loan programs that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  provide money to organizations, nonprofits, state agencies, state programs, local programs [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=268.76s)]
*  across the country. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  Just to give you a sense of how far ranging this could be, it's everything from Head Start [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  programs for early childhood education grants that cover renewable energy research and clean [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=282.36s)]
*  energy demonstrations. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=289.44s)]
*  There are special education grants. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=291.64s)]
*  All of those would have to be subject to this order. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=294.36s)]
*  There are some exceptions. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=296.8s)]
*  One exception, for example, says that nothing in this memo should be construed to impact [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=298.64s)]
*  Medicare or Social Security benefits. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=303.76s)]
*  They go on to explain that it's any type of assistance that's directly received by individuals [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=306.36s)]
*  wouldn't be affected. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=312.16s)]
*  So that leaves this sort of vast other area where the money is provided not directly to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=313.28s)]
*  people, but to organizations or states or other programs that provide benefits to Americans, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=319.28s)]
*  but not in a direct way. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=325.6s)]
*  Okay, so this memo, as you say, is quite a bombshell in Washington. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=327.28s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=332.6s)]
*  Well, what happens next is kind of a freakout, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=333.6s)]
*  Across the country, people begin to wonder what impact this is going to have. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=336.64s)]
*  Who's on the list? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=342.12s)]
*  That's the big question that's sort of ricocheting across Washington, but also across the country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=343.24s)]
*  In all of these programs that rely on the federal government for money, they wake up [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=347.44s)]
*  and are trying to figure out, is my program affected? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=351.64s)]
*  If so, how do I deal with that? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=355.2s)]
*  And so by midday Tuesday, after all of the angst in the country, the White House decides [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=357.12s)]
*  it needs to respond. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  Good to see all of you. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  Carolyn Levitt, who is the new White House press secretary for Mr. Trump, has her first [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=366.88s)]
*  press briefing for the White House press corps, and she really tries to push back. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=371.36s)]
*  Well, I think there's only uncertainty in this room amongst the media. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=376.24s)]
*  There's no uncertainty in this building. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  So let me provide the certainty and the clarity that all of you need. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=380.88s)]
*  You know, she really tries to explain that no, there's a lot of these programs that are [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=384.16s)]
*  not going to be affected. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=388.24s)]
*  Social Security benefits, Medicare benefits, food stamps, welfare benefits, assistance [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=390.88s)]
*  that is going directly to individuals will not be impacted by this pause. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=396.84s)]
*  It's essentially the White House trying to kind of reassure its own people that this [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=402.64s)]
*  big dramatic action by the president isn't going to sort of hit them in the pocketbooks [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=408.0s)]
*  directly. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=411.68s)]
*  But the questions keep piling up. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=412.68s)]
*  How long is this pause going to last? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=415.04s)]
*  Do you think there will be a list of who is affected and how much money is affected? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=417.68s)]
*  Medicaid. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=421.44s)]
*  Is that affected? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=422.44s)]
*  What about Medicaid, the health insurance program for low income people? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=424.24s)]
*  That's funded through money sent to the states by the federal government. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  Are you guaranteeing here that no individual now on Medicaid would see a cut off because [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=431.84s)]
*  of the policy? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=436.48s)]
*  I'll check back on that and get back to you. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=437.48s)]
*  John. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=439.64s)]
*  The White House later says that Medicaid is not impacted by the memo. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=440.64s)]
*  But the problem is that the reality is actually happening more quickly than their statements [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=444.4s)]
*  can keep up with. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=449.56s)]
*  So you have the system by which state Medicaid offices log in to get their money from the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=450.56s)]
*  federal government not only goes down, so all these states are locked out, but it goes [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  down with a big red banner across the top that says the system is down and we're delaying [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=463.08s)]
*  or canceling payments based on the president's executive orders. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=469.64000000000004s)]
*  So it becomes very clear very quickly that this memo has actually begun to have real [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=474.56s)]
*  world implications. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  How should we make sense of that disconnect? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the White House is saying Medicaid not affected, but Medicaid clearly was affected. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=495.96s)]
*  I mean, was the White House just not being forthcoming? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=502.24s)]
*  I'm not sure we know 100% the answer to that question. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=505.84s)]
*  I mean, in some ways, it's kind of a feature, not a bug of the Trump presidency is that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  he embraces the chaos. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=515.36s)]
*  He likes the sense that the American people feel like he's just out there, you know, kind [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=517.08s)]
*  of like a wrecking ball, essentially, right? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=523.32s)]
*  Like from President Trump's perspective, from the perspective of his supporters, they want [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=525.48s)]
*  him to come in like a bull in a china shop and kind of disrupt everything. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  And so I think in some ways, the Trump administration isn't so concerned about not having the answers [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=534.24s)]
*  to all the questions. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=539.2s)]
*  But I think that one of the repercussions of that is for the rest of the country and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=540.46s)]
*  especially in this case, the vast numbers of organizations that rely upon this funding [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=545.92s)]
*  and they need the money to pay rent, to pay salaries, to pay out benefits to people. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=552.3199999999999s)]
*  All of that has to happen in an organized and methodical way. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=558.28s)]
*  And this is anything but. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=561.24s)]
*  To that point, what are those thousands upon thousands of organizations and grantees saying? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=562.24s)]
*  What's happening over the course of the day? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=570.56s)]
*  Well, it's been a mixed bag. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=572.8s)]
*  Our reporters have sort of reached out broadly across the spectrum and some of them have [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=575.68s)]
*  not seen any direct impact yet, but they're essentially ringing their hands, right? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=580.8399999999999s)]
*  They're worried that maybe their research grant is funded by the federal government [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=585.76s)]
*  and they're not sure whether that will continue or perhaps they have a program that provides [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=591.04s)]
*  benefits to migrants and they're not sure if that's going to pass muster. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=597.26s)]
*  So there has been a lot of hand-wringing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=601.56s)]
*  And then there have been some examples of actual impact. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=603.8s)]
*  One of my colleagues talked to a woman who runs Head Start programs in Michigan. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  She has something like 41 schools that have about 600 students that come every day. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=613.4s)]
*  When all of this started going down on Tuesday, she decided to cancel class for Wednesday. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=619.76s)]
*  She was essentially worried that if funding dried up from the federal government, it was [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  unclear whether she could continue. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=629.92s)]
*  And so there have been those kinds of examples where people have actually taken steps to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=631.56s)]
*  stop what they're doing out of fear that continuing could sort of violate these executive orders [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=637.7199999999999s)]
*  or what President Trump wants to do. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=643.1199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  So it sounds like mass confusion is at least the bare minimum of what was happening. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, chaos, confusion across the country. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=649.76s)]
*  But at the same time, another thing is happening. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=654.76s)]
*  A real effort to try to stop this whole thing from moving forward, both politically and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=658.48s)]
*  legally. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=664.6s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=673.6s)]
*  So, Mike, tell us about the fights that have been brewing over this order since it was issued. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=681.08s)]
*  So the first fight that immediately happened was the political one. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=685.96s)]
*  The scope of the damage that will be done is enormous. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=691.52s)]
*  The Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately seized on this. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=697.12s)]
*  So as we stand here today, people should think about the mom who doesn't know if she can [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=700.12s)]
*  get her kid to childcare today. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=705.2s)]
*  It's a dagger at the heart of the average American family in red states, in blue states, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=708.2s)]
*  in cities, in suburbs, in rural areas. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=713.12s)]
*  It is just outrageous. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=717.16s)]
*  Asserting in a really forceful way that what the president had done would affect Americans, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=719.04s)]
*  would hurt Americans. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=726.2s)]
*  This decision is lawless, dangerous, destructive, cruel. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=728.0s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=735.24s)]
*  It's unconstitutional. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=736.6s)]
*  The idea on the part of the Democrats was that not only would this have a really terrible [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  impact on people who rely on this federal money, but they also questioned whether it [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=744.2800000000001s)]
*  would even be constitutional. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  I spoke to my attorney general this morning. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=751.48s)]
*  She's head of the state attorneys general association. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=753.88s)]
*  They're going to court right away on this. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  Horror. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  And on Tuesday, you had many Democratic state attorneys general coming together to file [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  a lawsuit to try to block the president's order from going into effect and keep the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=767.6s)]
*  money flowing. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  You had progressive groups who filed separate lawsuits trying to do the same. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=773.64s)]
*  The goal for all of them to try to block President Trump from moving forward with his actions [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=777.8s)]
*  regarding all of this federal money. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=784.24s)]
*  OK, so you did have these legal challenges coming out pretty much right away. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=786.0s)]
*  What were they arguing exactly? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=790.36s)]
*  Well, essentially, the gist from all of the different lawsuits boiled down to a general [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=792.76s)]
*  argument that what the president had done with this memo essentially violates the heart [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=798.24s)]
*  of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power of the purse. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=804.52s)]
*  It says Congress has the ability to decide how much money is spent, where is that money [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  is spent, and that, you know, essentially, the executive, in this case, President Trump [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=815.56s)]
*  and his administration is required and the language in the Constitution is to faithfully [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=821.24s)]
*  execute the laws that are passed, right, and that by essentially holding back this money, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=826.5200000000001s)]
*  President Trump was violating that basic precept of constitutional law. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  So in other words, the argument is Trump and the executive branch can't just suddenly take [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=836.9200000000001s)]
*  on a power that's always belonged to Congress. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=840.96s)]
*  That's right. And then another argument actually goes to a much more specific law, and that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=843.84s)]
*  was the Impoundment Act of 1974. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=849.6s)]
*  OK, we're going to have to define that for people. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=853.12s)]
*  I do not know what that is. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=854.6s)]
*  Right. That was essentially part of the reform efforts after President Nixon had really [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=856.76s)]
*  pursued aggressively a kind of imperial presidency in which he would pick and choose the laws [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=864.0s)]
*  and the spending that he wanted to put into action after Congress had passed them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  That essentially provided the impetus for Congress to reassert its authority and say, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  no, no, no, if you had any doubt that the Constitution actually mandates that the executive [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=882.4s)]
*  branch must put into effect the laws that we passed, we're going to pass a law that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=889.4799999999999s)]
*  actually says that and makes that very clear. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=894.8399999999999s)]
*  And Mike, what does the Trump administration say to these kinds of arguments that what [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=898.24s)]
*  he's doing here is illegal? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=901.64s)]
*  Essentially, they waived them aside. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=903.04s)]
*  Carolyn Levitt, the press secretary in her press briefing, essentially said, we disagree. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=904.48s)]
*  Our lawyers think that what the president has done is perfectly legal, and part of their [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=911.12s)]
*  argument relies, I think, on the temporary nature of the pause. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=915.8s)]
*  And whether they're right or the other folks are right obviously is up for argument, will [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=922.28s)]
*  be argued in courts. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=926.2s)]
*  But essentially, the White House position was we don't put any stock in the legal arguments [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=927.64s)]
*  against this. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=933.16s)]
*  We're very confident. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=934.16s)]
*  And to underscore that point, Carolyn Levitt said at the briefing today that the White House [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=935.3199999999999s)]
*  fully intends to defend what the president did all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=940.64s)]
*  So Mike, we are talking at about 6.30 p.m. on Tuesday, and we already have some updates [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=946.24s)]
*  on these lawsuits. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  Tell us how the lawsuits have started to make their way through the legal system. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=953.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=957.0400000000001s)]
*  So we're really at the very, very beginning. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=958.0400000000001s)]
*  But late Tuesday, a judge in the District of Columbia did rule, at least temporarily, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=959.2800000000001s)]
*  on one of the cases brought by a progressive group, essentially putting a temporary stay [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  on the president's order. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=971.12s)]
*  That means that the White House, the administration, is unable to move forward in enforcing the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=972.76s)]
*  order. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=979.64s)]
*  The judge said that she would rule in a more permanent way on February 3rd. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=980.64s)]
*  So essentially, for a number of days, the president's effort here is at least temporarily [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=985.44s)]
*  blocked. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=992.48s)]
*  So does that mean a full pause on this entire effort? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=993.48s)]
*  It does, at least for the moment. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=997.7600000000001s)]
*  And you said they already mentioned that they were ready for this to go all the way up to [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1000.48s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1003.96s)]
*  Might it go that far? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  And what do you think will happen if it does? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1006.9200000000001s)]
*  This feels like one of those moments in Washington where there is a real fundamental issue at [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1011.0s)]
*  stake, right? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1017.5600000000001s)]
*  The question of the power of an executive to make a sweeping decision like this versus [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1018.5600000000001s)]
*  the power of Congress to essentially control and mandate that their laws are faithfully [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1025.2s)]
*  executed. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1032.04s)]
*  In those moments when there are real clashes between executive and legislative power, it [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1033.04s)]
*  tends to be where the federal court system really does engage, and they do engage typically [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1039.12s)]
*  in a quick way. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1045.52s)]
*  So it's hard to predict 100% what will happen and how this will play out. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1046.6399999999999s)]
*  But I think most people we've talked to believe that this will make its way pretty quickly [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1051.28s)]
*  to the Supreme Court and that the Supreme Court justices will likely take it up because [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1057.4199999999998s)]
*  it is in their interest to clarify and to rule on a pretty fundamental question of presidential [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1061.52s)]
*  power. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1068.18s)]
*  And do we have a sense of how the Supreme Court might rule? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1069.18s)]
*  Well it's always hard to know, but I did talk to our colleague Adam Liptak, who is our exceptional [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1073.5s)]
*  Supreme Court reporter. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1079.18s)]
*  Adam is always cautious not to make too many predictions, but I think that he generally [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1080.54s)]
*  thinks that the presidents probably favor Congress in this fight and that the clarity [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1085.0600000000002s)]
*  with which Congress over the years has described that power probably means that the courts [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1091.14s)]
*  will rule against the president, but that's to be seen. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1097.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1101.38s)]
*  I mean I guess it raises the question though, if the memo isn't really likely to survive [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1102.38s)]
*  a court challenge ultimately, if it goes away in a matter of days or weeks, the Trump administration [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1108.18s)]
*  presumably would have seen that coming. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1115.86s)]
*  So what was the point of all of this? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1117.98s)]
*  What were they actually up to? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1120.3s)]
*  So I think that they are serious about pushing through changes to federal law when they can. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1124.38s)]
*  I don't think they would have embarked on this effort if they thought that it was not [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1131.74s)]
*  possible that they could win. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1135.8600000000001s)]
*  But they also recognize that if they don't ultimately win on a kind of legal basis and [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1137.98s)]
*  this memo either has to be scaled back or changed or maybe it never gets implemented [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1143.5800000000002s)]
*  I think from their perspective, they still have sent a really strong message to the country, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1151.78s)]
*  to especially President Trump's most ardent supporters, that he is trying, right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1158.06s)]
*  That he isn't somebody who's going to come in and tinker around the edges, that he really [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1164.46s)]
*  wants to fundamentally change the country. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1169.06s)]
*  And that message, that political message, is almost as important as succeeding in the [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1171.8999999999999s)]
*  end for them. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1176.86s)]
*  He won't win all the time and I think they know that, but that is sort of besides the point. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1179.5s)]
*  Mike, as we prepared for a potential second Trump administration, reporting really suggested [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1184.7s)]
*  that Trump 2.0 was going to be very different than Trump 1.0. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1189.42s)]
*  It would be more organized, it would be more effective. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1193.5s)]
*  Trump knows how the government works now. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1197.94s)]
*  He has lawyers who have executive orders written ready to go. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1200.18s)]
*  But this memo today and the chaos it sparked would seem to kind of undercut that idea. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1203.78s)]
*  So how do you make sense of that? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1210.86s)]
*  You know, it's actually, I was thinking about this today. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1213.7s)]
*  Today was the first time that it really felt like the first Trump term, which I covered [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1217.94s)]
*  from the beginning. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1223.94s)]
*  I recall covering the White House, the first Trump White House, at the end of the first [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1225.3s)]
*  week when President Trump signed the travel ban on several majority Muslim countries. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1230.34s)]
*  The chaos there was very similar in the sense that people didn't understand what was happening. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1236.74s)]
*  I remember talking to Trump administration officials late into the night asking them [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1242.34s)]
*  for details about what the executive order meant, how it would be implemented. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1246.86s)]
*  They didn't have any of the answers. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1251.6599999999999s)]
*  But I think what's a bit different here from the chaos of the first Trump term is that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1253.84s)]
*  now Trump has a bit more of an intention, you know, not only to have kind of political [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1259.42s)]
*  power and to, you know, have a presidency for another four years, but it's to reshape [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1265.42s)]
*  this whole government that he sees as having been filled with woke ideology and liberal [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1271.8200000000002s)]
*  ideology and to purge it of all of that and remake it in his image in the, you know, make [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1278.18s)]
*  America great movement ideology. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1284.26s)]
*  You know, for him, President Trump is all about making sure that he leaves a legacy [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1288.5s)]
*  that the country has been, you know, and certainly the government has been remade in his image. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1294.8200000000002s)]
*  And the question is, will the institutions hold? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1301.0600000000002s)]
*  It's always the question, right? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1303.18s)]
*  The question was asked the first time around during the first four years. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1308.7s)]
*  And I think what we see in what's happened over the last eight or nine days, and especially [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1312.3000000000002s)]
*  what's happened from Monday night forward, is that President Trump is absolutely willing [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1316.96s)]
*  and determined to test the boundaries, to test the institutions of government and see [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1323.4s)]
*  how far he can get in his efforts to remake the government in his image. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1328.4s)]
*  And he will continue to push and the institutions will continue to push back. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1332.56s)]
*  And I think the American people will be watching the outcome of that for the days, weeks, months [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1337.46s)]
*  and probably years to come. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1342.4s)]
*  Mike, thank you. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1346.96s)]
*  Sure. Happy to. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1353.64s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1360.64s)]
*  Here's what else you should know today. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1366.64s)]
*  President Trump moved toward pushing transgender people out of the military by telling the [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1369.32s)]
*  Pentagon that anyone who openly identified that way should be seen as having an impediment [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1374.28s)]
*  to the physical and mental well-being necessary for military service. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1380.24s)]
*  While the order did not immediately exclude anyone from the military, it gave the Pentagon [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1385.72s)]
*  60 days to update its policy on medical standards and 30 days to come forward with revised guidance [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1390.44s)]
*  on how to implement Trump's vision. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1397.6399999999999s)]
*  And also on Tuesday, the Trump administration offered roughly 2 million federal workers [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1401.76s)]
*  the option to resign and still be paid through the end of September. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1407.08s)]
*  The message came in the form of an email from the Office of Personnel Management, which [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1412.36s)]
*  oversees the federal workforce. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1416.6s)]
*  It had the subject line, fork in the road, and said that a majority of federal agencies [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1419.04s)]
*  would probably be downsized and that a substantial number of employees would be furloughed or [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1424.44s)]
*  reclassified to a status that would make them easier to fire. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1429.38s)]
*  The effort was meant to reduce the size of the federal workforce and to help push out [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1433.2600000000002s)]
*  people who do not support President Trump's political agenda. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1438.5s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko and Will Reed, with help from Sydney Harper, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59VDsVBRvT8&t=1447.38s)]
