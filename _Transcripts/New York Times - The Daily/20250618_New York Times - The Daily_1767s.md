# Will the U.S. Join Israel’s War With Iran? | The Daily
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=0.0s)]
*  In the growing conflict between Israel and Iran, one question now looms over Washington. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=10.88s)]
*  How far will President Trump go to entangle the United States in a new war? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=17.06s)]
*  Today, my colleague Jonathan Swan, on Trump's shifting stance on U.S. involvement and the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=22.84s)]
*  options that he has now waned. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=28.94s)]
*  It's Wednesday, June 18. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=40.900000000000006s)]
*  Jonathan, we're talking to you at about 4 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, and as of now, there's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  growing evidence that President Trump is seriously considering joining Israel's bombing campaign [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=55.14s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=59.9s)]
*  That's something that Trump has long said that he has not wanted to do. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=62.38s)]
*  He has been very opposed to pulling the U.S. into more war. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=66.58s)]
*  Can you just explain to start us off, how and why has Trump's position on this shifted? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=72.78s)]
*  Look, it's not a simple story. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=79.18s)]
*  It took place over a period of months. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=82.34s)]
*  And yes, it's true, Donald Trump said, I'm not going to get you into another endless [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  war, Middle East war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=91.62s)]
*  But he's also said consistently that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear bomb. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=93.28s)]
*  So basically what happened was Donald Trump leaves office in January 2021. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=99.48s)]
*  According to the Justice Department, the Iranian government hired hitmen to kill Donald Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=108.02s)]
*  People forget that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  This was revenge for supposedly for his killing of a top Iranian general in early 2020. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=114.89999999999999s)]
*  The Iranians also hack the emails of some of his top aides, including his now chief [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=123.69999999999999s)]
*  of staff, Suzy Wiles. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=129.62s)]
*  Iran, of course, denies all of this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  This created a conventional wisdom that God help Iran if Donald Trump gets elected again, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=133.16s)]
*  because he will rain fury upon them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=140.96s)]
*  And from the Israeli perspective, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a long time has wanted [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=144.6s)]
*  to undertake a military operation to take out Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=149.96s)]
*  And in his first term, Donald Trump gave Netanyahu virtually everything he wanted. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=156.24s)]
*  So it was this confluence of events. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=162.44s)]
*  You had Trump returning to the White House, supposedly filled with desire for vengeance. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  And then you had Netanyahu. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=173.24s)]
*  And now he had the thinking went, a president who was going to be more full throated in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=175.04s)]
*  support of this Israeli policy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=181.12s)]
*  But that's not what happened. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=183.32s)]
*  When Trump got into office, one of the first things he did was he empowered Steve Witkoff, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=186.2s)]
*  who is a billionaire, real estate developer, friends with Trump for many years, no experience [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  in foreign policy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=200.1s)]
*  Trump appointed him special envoy to the Middle East. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=203.04s)]
*  And pretty early in the administration, Trump said to him, I want you to try to get a deal [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=207.44s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't want to go to war. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  He wanted diplomacy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=214.06s)]
*  100% he wanted diplomacy. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  There's this BS kind of revisionist history going on right now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=217.56s)]
*  You see it sort of seeping out in kind of like anonymous officials and stuff, you know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  from Israel or some here saying, this was all a brilliant ruse. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump was in on it all along. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  He was pretending to be interested in diplomacy, but really he was always supportive of this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=232.68s)]
*  effort. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=237.76s)]
*  Total nonsense. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=238.76s)]
*  Trump was really serious about getting a deal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=240.32s)]
*  But at the same time, Donald Trump was very clear with his advisors early on in the administration. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=243.8s)]
*  He did not trust Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=251.0s)]
*  He thought that Netanyahu was trying to drag him into a war on Netanyahu's timeline. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=254.68s)]
*  Trump wanted to be given the space and time to try to find a diplomatic solution because [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=261.68s)]
*  in his view, that is preferable to war. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=267.24s)]
*  But his baseline was actually always the same, which is Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=270.0s)]
*  So really what you had was this dual track. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=275.2s)]
*  You had Trump authorizing his team to pursue diplomacy, but Netanyahu determined to go [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=277.32s)]
*  ahead with a military operation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=284.36s)]
*  And when you talk to people around Trump, it was always a case of trying to hold Netanyahu [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=287.2s)]
*  at bay for long enough to try to get to a deal. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=292.6s)]
*  So tell me more about what Netanyahu is up to while Trump is pursuing this diplomatic [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=297.28s)]
*  path. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=302.96s)]
*  Well, Netanyahu is of course dealing with a war in Gaza and he's going after Iran's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=303.96s)]
*  proxies in the region, including in Lebanon, where exploding pages killed scores of Hezbollah [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=310.0s)]
*  operatives and wounded thousands. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=317.68s)]
*  And then in early February, Netanyahu makes his first visit to the Trump White House in [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  the second term. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=326.52s)]
*  And he's clearly thought very carefully about what to say to Trump to persuade him to get [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  on board with this military mission to take out Iran's nuclear program. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=334.88s)]
*  So he brings along with him a gift for Trump and it's a gold-plated pager, the same device [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=340.28s)]
*  that Israel secretly packed with explosives and sold to unwitting Hezbollah operatives. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=349.2s)]
*  So he's like commemorating this attack with this gift. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=356.32s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=359.0s)]
*  And Trump was kind of weirded out by it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=360.0s)]
*  He told someone afterwards that he thought it was just really weird and kind of disturbing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=362.76s)]
*  But in that meeting in the Oval Office, Netanyahu walks Trump through a visual presentation, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=368.32s)]
*  a slide presentation of Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=376.04s)]
*  And he's starting this argument that time is short, we have this historic window, this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=380.84s)]
*  historic opportunity, Iran's air defenses have been battered, we have them where we [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=386.28s)]
*  want them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=391.79999999999995s)]
*  This proxy force, Hezbollah, was decimated. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  So now is the moment. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=396.84s)]
*  And with that, he is hoping that the US will join them in a mission. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=400.23999999999995s)]
*  There's not like one simple ask. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  There's a whole range of things that the United States could do from covert support and intelligence [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=408.16s)]
*  to things that Israel doesn't have the capabilities to do. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=414.76s)]
*  So for example, you have bunker busting bombs that weigh 30,000 pounds that would be needed [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=418.28s)]
*  to destroy a nuclear site named Fordo deep underground. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=424.96s)]
*  The US has these bombs, Israel doesn't. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=429.88s)]
*  So you know, one of Netanyahu's objectives was to try to convince Trump to provide these [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=432.84s)]
*  weapons to go after Iran. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  But he failed in that moment. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=440.11999999999995s)]
*  What do you mean he failed? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=441.96s)]
*  How does Trump respond to this? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=442.96s)]
*  Well, Trump sends him home empty handed. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=443.96s)]
*  He's not ready to give him the bombs. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  He's not ready to commit to America doing a joint mission with Israel. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=448.35999999999996s)]
*  He says we are going to try diplomacy, we're going to try to make a deal. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's the method we're using. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=458.0s)]
*  So it sounds like at this moment in time that you've described, Netanyahu and Trump have [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=459.88s)]
*  at least one goal that is the same, which is that neither of them want to allow Iran [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=465.6s)]
*  to get a nuclear weapon, but they disagree on the means to achieve that end. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=470.4s)]
*  Trump wants diplomacy, Netanyahu wants force. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=475.4s)]
*  What happens after this meeting? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=478.92s)]
*  Well, after this meeting, Trump starts to put out feelers to Iran. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=481.6s)]
*  Iran had already put out its own feelers to the US. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=489.16s)]
*  So about half a dozen countries or so were sending messages. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=492.32s)]
*  The Iranians are interested in talking, back channels, all that kind of stuff, including [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=497.36s)]
*  the Omanis, who often play that role. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=501.32s)]
*  But Trump himself decides to send a letter to the Ayatollah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=504.12s)]
*  Is that unusual? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=509.2s)]
*  Well, it's very Trumpian. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=510.2s)]
*  It recalls his letters to Kim Jong-un of North Korea in his first term. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=511.2s)]
*  So in early March, a source of mine sees Trump and Trump's new kind of thing at that moment [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=516.88s)]
*  was he would wave around this letter that he'd sent to the Ayatollah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=524.84s)]
*  Like a copy of it? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=529.32s)]
*  It was a copy of it, yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=530.32s)]
*  And he'd say, I wrote the most beautiful letter to the Ayatollah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=531.76s)]
*  Do you want to hear about it? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=535.72s)]
*  And he would give these live renditions of the letter. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=536.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=539.84s)]
*  What did the letter say? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=540.84s)]
*  But one visitor who was treated to one of these live renditions told me the letter's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=542.84s)]
*  basic message was, I don't want war. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=549.08s)]
*  I don't want to blow you off the map. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=552.24s)]
*  I want a deal. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=554.52s)]
*  So very classic Trump message, which is, you know, I want diplomacy, but also I might remind [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  you that I could completely annihilate you. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=564.12s)]
*  Not subtle stuff. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=567.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=568.4000000000001s)]
*  So that happens. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  So that's March, April, but the negotiations start. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  So Steve Witkoff and the director of policy planning at the State Department, Michael [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=573.52s)]
*  Anton, they go over to Oman and they start these negotiations. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=577.84s)]
*  And you know, they spend hours and hours over a number of different rounds over a couple [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=583.56s)]
*  of months negotiating with the Iranians. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=589.64s)]
*  What could you live with? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=592.6999999999999s)]
*  What could you not live with? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=593.6999999999999s)]
*  And finally, at the end of May, the US side actually presents a proposal, a written proposal [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=595.12s)]
*  that says that ultimately there can be no enrichment, but here are these ideas for how [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=600.8s)]
*  you can have civilian nuclear power. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=605.18s)]
*  And Steve Witkoff was telling Trump, we're on the cusp of a deal. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=607.84s)]
*  For a while, Trump was saying, I think we're doing better with Iran than we are with Russia. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=611.72s)]
*  I think we could get a deal. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=616.36s)]
*  They really want a deal. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=617.4s)]
*  They're really weak, etc., etc. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=618.52s)]
*  Jonathan, while these talks are happening and it looks, at least for a time, like the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=621.04s)]
*  US and Iran are inching closer to a deal, how does Netanyahu feel about all of this [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=625.08s)]
*  and the negotiations? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=630.6s)]
*  Not good. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=632.84s)]
*  He comes and visits in early April, comes to Washington, and that was not a good visit. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=633.92s)]
*  He again reiterated they want to get the bunker busting bomb. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=640.36s)]
*  But Trump is very clear, no, you are to do nothing while we're still negotiating. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=645.88s)]
*  And after that meeting, Trump's entire team reinforced that message to the Israelis, don't [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=651.64s)]
*  do it, don't do it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=657.16s)]
*  And did the US officials who were saying that feel like they were being listened to or that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=658.82s)]
*  Israel would do what they said? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=663.92s)]
*  At the time they did. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=665.54s)]
*  They think, well, the US Trump team thinks, well, I think they got the message. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=667.52s)]
*  But in May, the US intelligence community picks up intelligence showing that it's highly [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=672.08s)]
*  likely that Netanyahu is going to strike Iran with or without American support. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=679.64s)]
*  And this was a very unwelcome discovery. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, discovery is probably too strong a word because they knew how badly he wanted. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=693.32s)]
*  This is not some surprise, but the clarity of, oh, he's really going to do this, really, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=698.92s)]
*  really dawned upon them. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=705.68s)]
*  And what is this here? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=707.24s)]
*  What is the extent of the attack that they're learning about? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, it was quite expansive. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=711.52s)]
*  So it wasn't just an attack that would be narrowly targeted at this facility or that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=714.28s)]
*  facility. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=719.9599999999999s)]
*  It was an attack that could potentially imperil the regime itself. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=720.9599999999999s)]
*  But as you've been saying, Jonathan, these are not new goals for Netanyahu. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=724.24s)]
*  So I'm just sort of wondering why he's choosing now. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=728.28s)]
*  Well, the Israelis say that Iran is on the cusp of having a nuclear bomb. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=730.88s)]
*  In all of our conversations with senior Trump administration officials, found that they [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=737.48s)]
*  were unaware of any new piece of intelligence showing that the Iranians were rushing to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=741.8s)]
*  build a nuclear bomb. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=746.4399999999999s)]
*  So we did not find evidence on the US side to support that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=747.8s)]
*  But there are a number of people at the senior level of the Trump administration who nonetheless [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=752.56s)]
*  believe that Iran is too close for comfort to being able to get to a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=757.42s)]
*  Regardless, once this information came through, once they had this intelligence that Israel [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=764.5s)]
*  was very likely to move ahead with an attack, the Trump team had a conversation and they [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=770.5799999999999s)]
*  basically said, if this is going to happen, if this is very likely to happen, we need [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=775.8599999999999s)]
*  to be prepared. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=780.9s)]
*  So they explore a range of options from what can we do to restrain Netanyahu all the way [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=782.58s)]
*  up to full throated American military participation in a regime change war. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=788.36s)]
*  So that's all happening. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=795.22s)]
*  But meanwhile, Trump is getting really frustrated with the Iranians. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=797.14s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=801.22s)]
*  He keeps saying, take the deal. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=802.22s)]
*  It was almost like they weren't understanding that his threat was real. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=804.0600000000001s)]
*  And then two Fridays ago, I was on Air Force One with President Trump flying from Washington [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=808.58s)]
*  to New Jersey because he was spending the weekend at his golf club in Bedminster. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=815.4200000000001s)]
*  And the Ayatollah had made a comment during the week, which basically, it was really rejecting [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=821.0200000000001s)]
*  the Trump team's proposal. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=826.6600000000001s)]
*  It was saying, we are going to have enrichment. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=828.7800000000001s)]
*  We must have enrichment. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=830.76s)]
*  So I asked Trump on the plane about this. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=832.62s)]
*  I said, what did you make of the Ayatollah saying this? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=834.46s)]
*  And he was adamant, no enrichment. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=837.78s)]
*  And I could just see, he's really serious about this. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=842.22s)]
*  And I could just tell there was a shift. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=847.9s)]
*  There was not the optimism that I was detecting from him and his team a couple of weeks earlier. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=853.5s)]
*  I could tell that he thought that these guys might not actually be serious about a deal. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=859.66s)]
*  And that this was potentially going in a different direction. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=867.1s)]
*  So, Jonathan, last week you were on Air Force One with the president before the attacks [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=897.86s)]
*  had occurred. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=903.5s)]
*  And you start getting the sense that something might be shifting. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=905.02s)]
*  There might be something in the works. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=908.5s)]
*  Can you walk us through what you learn next? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=910.5s)]
*  So the next day, it's a Saturday, we learn that Trump has changed his schedule. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=913.0600000000001s)]
*  We were expecting to fly back on Air Force One to Washington on Sunday afternoon. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=919.5400000000001s)]
*  And we get this notice from the White House saying, he's actually going to go to Camp [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=924.82s)]
*  David on Sunday. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=929.22s)]
*  And that was very curious to me because Donald Trump does not voluntarily go to Camp David [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=932.1400000000001s)]
*  after a weekend playing golf in New Jersey, went to the UFC on Saturday night. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=940.38s)]
*  He doesn't like Camp David. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=945.7800000000001s)]
*  It's a very rustic, wooded retreat. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=947.1400000000001s)]
*  So that made me think, well, something's up. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=950.94s)]
*  And I still didn't know I was making phone calls talking to sources. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=954.42s)]
*  I actually, at that point, couldn't establish what was happening. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=956.9s)]
*  But what we've learned in the last week reporting with my colleagues, Maggie Haberman, Mark [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=961.5s)]
*  Mazzetti, Ronan Bergman and others, is that John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, and Dan [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=967.66s)]
*  Kane, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave a presentation. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=975.14s)]
*  It lasted about two and a half hours. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=980.26s)]
*  And Ratcliffe laid out the CIA's assessment that it was highly likely that Netanyahu was [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=983.2600000000001s)]
*  moving ahead with this military operation with or without American participation. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=989.2600000000001s)]
*  But they still don't have a briefing from, it's not like the Israelis said, here are [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=995.74s)]
*  our war plans. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=998.9000000000001s)]
*  Here's what we're doing. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1000.1s)]
*  The next day, any remaining doubts are dispelled. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1001.86s)]
*  Trump has a phone call with Netanyahu. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1007.5400000000001s)]
*  And Netanyahu is unequivocal. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1010.6600000000001s)]
*  They're doing it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1014.46s)]
*  The mission is a go. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1015.86s)]
*  And he gives Trump pretty high level overview of what they're doing, talks about some of [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1017.5400000000001s)]
*  the aspects of the military campaign. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1022.5400000000001s)]
*  And Trump did not exert substantial counter pressure. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1025.66s)]
*  He did not, as far as we've been able to ascertain, lean in to do not do this, you should not [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1029.94s)]
*  do this. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1037.06s)]
*  The message the Israelis had after that was there's no daylight between us. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1038.22s)]
*  And after that call, he said to some of his advisors, we might have to help them with this. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1042.86s)]
*  So how does Trump decide to have America participate in that initial attack on Iran? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1048.46s)]
*  Well, we don't actually know that yet. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1053.26s)]
*  Interestingly, he authorized certain support from the US intelligence community. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1055.26s)]
*  And because of the nature of national secrets, we still haven't got the full picture of what [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1060.98s)]
*  America has done so far. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1066.58s)]
*  But it's not nothing. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1068.8999999999999s)]
*  And at a minimum, it's intelligence sharing. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1070.74s)]
*  But I expect that we'll find out that it's more than that. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1072.82s)]
*  But he's still telling people, I think I told him not to do it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1076.02s)]
*  Even on the day of the strikes, he was very, very ambivalent and was still eager to see [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1079.46s)]
*  if they could get a deal with Iran. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1085.22s)]
*  He's still trying to put a little bit of distance between the US and Israel in this attack. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1087.46s)]
*  100%. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1092.34s)]
*  And you saw that, I mean, that evening when the bombs start flying, it's about eight o'clock. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1093.46s)]
*  Trump has just been at the congressional picnic. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1100.74s)]
*  He goes down to the White House Situation Room. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1103.3400000000001s)]
*  They're all watching this unfold, getting intelligence updates. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1105.8200000000002s)]
*  And everyone's wondering, when is Trump going to make a statement? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1109.74s)]
*  What's he going to say? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1112.38s)]
*  And certainly in my memory, anytime Israel's at war, US stands with Israel, right? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1113.94s)]
*  The administration put out a pretty extraordinary statement. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1122.94s)]
*  Its first statement that it put out was from the Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1126.3400000000001s)]
*  Nowhere in that statement did it say, we stand with Israel. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1131.02s)]
*  In fact, the entire statement was basically built around distancing the United States [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1134.26s)]
*  from this military operation and warning Iran do not go after us, America. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1139.8200000000002s)]
*  So even though we know that secretly they were helping in certain ways that are not [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1144.6200000000001s)]
*  completely clear to us yet, publicly they were distancing themselves. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1150.3799999999999s)]
*  And Trump said nothing for at least a couple of hours. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1154.58s)]
*  He just was uncharacteristically silent. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1157.4199999999998s)]
*  They basically wanted people to think they had nothing to do with it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1161.4199999999998s)]
*  That was what they were projecting and putting out there. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1164.4199999999998s)]
*  But as the night unfolded and certainly that first wave of attacks appeared [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1167.3s)]
*  stunningly successful, Israel was doing precision strikes, killing, you know, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1174.58s)]
*  Iranian military leaders hitting strategic sites. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1180.3s)]
*  People around Trump are like, oh, this is actually pretty impressive. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1185.6599999999999s)]
*  And Trump's favorite TV channel, Fox News, is broadcasting wall to wall [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1189.74s)]
*  on Israel's military genius. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1196.8999999999999s)]
*  And it was really interesting. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1200.54s)]
*  You could see it happen in real time. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1202.3s)]
*  Trump basically thinking, I need some credit here. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1204.86s)]
*  And the next morning, he does this series of phone calls with different reporters [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1209.82s)]
*  where he's saying this is excellent, this operation is brilliant, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1215.74s)]
*  and hinting that he had much more to do with it than people realized. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1219.58s)]
*  Starting to take ownership of it publicly. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1223.18s)]
*  Because it's being hailed as a success. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1225.82s)]
*  I can't get inside his motivations, but those two things are true, right? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1227.78s)]
*  Like this looked like a great success and Donald Trump starts claiming credit for it, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1230.62s)]
*  whereas, you know, just hours earlier, they were distancing themselves from it. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1234.3799999999999s)]
*  And then we were hearing from sources that Trump was very seriously considering [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1238.58s)]
*  escalating America's involvement in a serious way. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1244.3799999999999s)]
*  So we can start to see his position about what the United States involvement [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1248.3799999999999s)]
*  should be shifting in real time. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1252.78s)]
*  And very quickly, it sounds like. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1254.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes. So Sunday night, he flies to Canada for the G7. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1256.6999999999998s)]
*  He's there on Monday. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1262.46s)]
*  And then he cuts his trip short. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1264.26s)]
*  And really starts to signal that he was now moving towards potential military options. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1267.6599999999999s)]
*  So he says, you know, people are saying I want to go back to D.C. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1276.3799999999999s)]
*  to work on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1280.26s)]
*  Wrong. They have no idea. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1282.9399999999998s)]
*  It's much bigger than that. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1285.1399999999999s)]
*  It's fake news that I'm doing peace talks, fake news. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1287.2199999999998s)]
*  And then his messages start to get more and more menacing. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1291.3799999999999s)]
*  To the point where today we're recording this on Tuesday afternoon, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1295.98s)]
*  but earlier today, Trump posts, I mean, it is extraordinary that we're watching [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1301.42s)]
*  a commander in chief do this in real time. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1308.22s)]
*  He posts, we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1311.34s)]
*  And the next message, he's directly threatening the supreme leader. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1316.9s)]
*  He says, we know exactly where the supreme leader is hiding. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1321.1s)]
*  He's an easy target. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1324.74s)]
*  We're not going to take him out, at least not for now, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1326.7s)]
*  but you better not shoot missiles at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1329.14s)]
*  And then his next message is just all caps unconditional surrender. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1333.9s)]
*  So people around Trump that I've spoken to believe that he's already made [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1338.94s)]
*  the decision to drop this bomb. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1344.22s)]
*  I don't know if he has or he hasn't. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1346.1s)]
*  I've given up on trying to put declarative statements around [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1347.98s)]
*  Donald Trump's decision making. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1352.74s)]
*  Of course, he could change his mind, but that's where things stand right now. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1354.82s)]
*  I just want to make sure I'm clear on this, Jonathan. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1360.26s)]
*  So it is possible that we might see these 30,000 pound bombs being dropped [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1362.54s)]
*  at some time in the not so distant future on this nuclear enrichment [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1368.42s)]
*  facility that's buried deep underground. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1372.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1375.5s)]
*  And the one thing we do know from our reporting is that he is seriously [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1376.3s)]
*  considering actually leaning toward was what we wrote in our article based on [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1381.54s)]
*  some of the comments he's been making to people bombing Fordow, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1386.3s)]
*  the deep underground nuclear site in Iran. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1391.62s)]
*  To what extent is the moment that we're in now a result of Trump changing [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1395.42s)]
*  his mind about the likelihood that a negotiation would produce a deal [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1400.94s)]
*  versus this being a story about how Benjamin Netanyahu figured out [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1405.74s)]
*  a way to bring Trump onto his side, maybe even without Trump's willing participation at times? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1410.82s)]
*  In other words, is this a story of Benjamin Netanyahu basically out maneuvering Trump into this? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1418.9399999999998s)]
*  I think that's part of the story for sure, but I don't think it's as simple as that. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1424.6599999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump was always of the view that Iran could not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1430.78s)]
*  He was never as isolationist, anti-interventionist, pick your adjective, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1435.42s)]
*  as some of his supporters wanted him to be. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1441.9s)]
*  So I do think that Donald Trump was left in a position where he was not driving events. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1445.42s)]
*  So in that sense, you could say, yes, absolutely. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1450.22s)]
*  Netanyahu was driving this train. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1453.1000000000001s)]
*  Trump was reacting to events. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1455.46s)]
*  And the fear, of course, has always been that if Israel hit Iran in this way, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1458.42s)]
*  and particularly if the United States got involved in the way that you have reported [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1462.7s)]
*  Trump is considering getting involved, that it could spiral out of control in some fashion [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1466.7s)]
*  and engulf the entire region into another war. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1471.9s)]
*  And as you said, Trump is a passenger on this train with Netanyahu in the driver's seat. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1474.9s)]
*  The fact is, no matter what messaging Trump or the White House put out, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1481.14s)]
*  America is now engaged in a war. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1487.5s)]
*  Right now, at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, it's a fairly limited engagement. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1490.26s)]
*  But if Donald Trump drops the Bunker Buster bomb, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1498.22s)]
*  the door has opened to a much larger range of possibilities. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1503.78s)]
*  I have to say, Jonathan, if the U.S. gets involved in another war in the Middle East [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1510.62s)]
*  where there's this big question of whether or not a country has a weapon of mass destruction, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1514.34s)]
*  where regime change is at least on the table, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1522.1399999999999s)]
*  that's going to sound very, very familiar to people who lived through the Iraq War. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1526.02s)]
*  And I think, understandably, people are going to have a lot of questions about [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1530.74s)]
*  whether the United States should be involved at all, just given our collective experience. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1534.4199999999998s)]
*  And I just sort of wonder what you think about that feeling. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1539.06s)]
*  Well, it's a very understandable feeling. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1543.58s)]
*  Donald Trump has made clear, even in the last few days, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1545.6599999999999s)]
*  that he has no desire or interest in sending American troops into Iran and engaging a ground force. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1549.8999999999999s)]
*  And he certainly hopes, I believe, that this will be a matter of dropping a bomb [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1557.58s)]
*  and staying out, letting Israel take care of the rest. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1563.8999999999999s)]
*  And maybe it turns out like that, but maybe it doesn't. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1567.98s)]
*  And unfortunately for Trump, he doesn't have the only vote in deciding that. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1573.58s)]
*  Netanyahu drove this war. He drove towards this military campaign. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1581.34s)]
*  And Iran has a vote too. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1586.9399999999998s)]
*  And America has bases in the region and a lot of soft targets here at home [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1590.86s)]
*  that, God forbid, Iran might try to strike. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1598.6200000000001s)]
*  So we are heading down a cycle of uncertainty that we're going to have to confront. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1606.7800000000002s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you so much. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1618.7800000000002s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1620.7800000000002s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1628.38s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1641.9s)]
*  The likelihood of growing U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1644.6200000000001s)]
*  has reawakened a long-dormant debate on Capitol Hill [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFSro590Xg&t=1649.5s)]
