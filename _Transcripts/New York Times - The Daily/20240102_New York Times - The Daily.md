# Trump's 2024 Playbook
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEuYKRJhM0Y)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  As 2024 begins, we examine the campaign strategies of the two leading candidates for president,
*  Joe Biden and Donald Trump, to understand what they'll look like over the next year.
*  Today, my colleague Maggie Haberman on how Trump is trying to wrap up the Republican nomination
*  before any court case can stop him.
*  It's Tuesday, January 2nd.
*  Maggie?
*  Michael?
*  Happy New Year to you.
*  Happy New Year to you.
*  This is our first episode of 2024.
*  I am honored to be here with you for your first episode of 2024.
*  And we decided to give our listeners a set of handrails to understand what is likely
*  to be the biggest story of the year, which is the presidential race, the 2024 campaign.
*  And we turn to you, Maggie, to better understand the candidacy of Donald Trump.
*  You have chronicled Trump now for...ever?
*  And a day.
*  It's been a long time.
*  Trump, who, of course, leads his Republican rivals by what feels like historic margins.
*  And what we really want you to do is give us a blueprint for what his candidacy is going
*  to look like, what it's going to feel like, and have you help us understand its overarching
*  strategy and its message.
*  And I think we have to start with the reality that this campaign is really defined by how
*  much Trump has become a defendant, not in just one court, but in many courts, in the
*  many cases where he's been indicted or sued.
*  So just, I guess, start there.
*  Sure.
*  I often say that this is not a campaign, it's a series of court dates wrapped around some
*  debates.
*  And that's really been true.
*  These court cases are the centerpiece of Donald Trump's life right now.
*  And because of that, they have been integrated into his campaign messaging, fundraising,
*  and with him as the likely Republican nominee the entire election.
*  So if you think about it, going back to March, he has been indicted four times.
*  He's been indicted over hush money payments made to an adult film star in the 2016 campaign.
*  That's the Manhattan District Attorney's case.
*  He's been indicted by the federal government over his handling of classified documents.
*  He's been indicted by the special counsel over his efforts to overturn the election results.
*  And he's been indicted by the Fulton County District Attorney in Georgia over his efforts
*  to overturn the election results in that state.
*  He faces 91 counts in those cases.
*  And those are criminal charges.
*  Right.
*  That's a lot of counts.
*  That's a lot of cases.
*  A lot of felony counts.
*  Beyond that, there are two civil cases.
*  There's the E. Jean Carroll defamation case.
*  Remember, she is a woman who said that Trump sexually assaulted her decades ago and that
*  he defamed her.
*  And there is a civil case brought by the New York attorney general that accuses him of
*  financial fraud.
*  So just logistically, all of these cases take up a lot of his time.
*  They will ultimately make campaigning somewhat tricky to schedule for the criminal cases he
*  must be in court.
*  Right.
*  It's hard to schedule a rally, a fundraiser, a meet and greet weeks or months out when you've
*  got this many court cases that may require you to be in court.
*  That's just going to be a reality for him.
*  It's unlike any reality I think any leading candidate for president has ever faced.
*  Yes.
*  And as a result, his campaign for months has been coming up with a strategy that could
*  ensure that he is still a political candidate no matter what happens in those court cases.
*  And what is that strategy?
*  So it was an elaborate backroom campaign using his influence over the Republican Party
*  to try to make sure that he has wrapped up the nomination, the number of delegates that
*  he needs to become the nominee as fast as he can to make sure that if he is convicted
*  in one of these cases, it can't be taken away from him when it comes time for the party's
*  convention in July.
*  Okay.
*  So what does this backroom campaign actually look like on the ground?
*  So it's essentially a lot of schmoozing and glad handing and sort of traditional politics,
*  all of which are working toward the ultimate goal of having the system work better for
*  Donald Trump.
*  The system of course being the nomination of a Republican candidate for president.
*  Correct, which itself involves a lot of series of state Republican Party rules that get changed
*  in the fall, the year before the general election.
*  So some of this was pretty traditional looking, right?
*  Trump has made a bunch of phone calls to officials in various states.
*  One was Hawaii, where the state party chairman was elected in May and soon after got a voicemail
*  from Trump.
*  And it's a very classic Trump message.
*  It's your all time favorite president.
*  I just called to congratulate you.
*  Seemingly small, but probably quite meaningful for him.
*  Correct.
*  It's the kind of thing that is pretty cost free for Trump that he doles out pretty easily.
*  And then there's the Mar-a-Lago aspect of it, where Trump has people down to his club
*  and courts them.
*  So there was a dinner with state Republican officials, including the head of the Nevada
*  GOP, who's a Trump ally.
*  Months after this dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the Nevada GOP significantly changed their rules
*  around their nominating contest that put Ron DeSantis at a huge disadvantage.
*  How so?
*  Well, it basically blocked the super PAC that DeSantis has been relying on for months from
*  taking part in the state caucuses.
*  This new rule basically bars super PACs from sending in speakers or literature even, just
*  pamphlets to caucus sites or even getting data from the state party, meaning data they
*  can use to approach voters.
*  That really, really harmed DeSantis.
*  It was a laser aimed at him.
*  I just want to be clear.
*  This is an important chronology.
*  The head of the Nevada Republican party goes to a dinner at Mar-a-Lago.
*  And obviously spent some real time with Trump and get some affection and some exposure.
*  And not long after, Nevada changes how campaigns can be run in the state in a way that empowers
*  Trump and kind of kneecaps his biggest rival, Ron DeSantis.
*  The Nevada GOP did.
*  It was building toward state election rules that ultimately favor Trump, according to
*  people close to Trump and people on campaigns aligned with his rivals.
*  And the impact of it has been pretty dramatic, which is that no serious candidate is really
*  campaigning in Nevada.
*  Super PACs have not been airing ads on behalf of their candidates.
*  Basically, everybody has foregone the state.
*  Huh.
*  So basically this rule change has resulted in everybody's ceding Nevada to Donald Trump.
*  Even if they're not actually doing it, that's the effect.
*  Where else has Trump's backroom campaign been effective?
*  So California, they made the biggest changes of any state to primary rules to favor Trump
*  this cycle.
*  And Republicans there changed the formula for how delegates are allocated.
*  In the past, there's 52 congressional districts in the state.
*  And candidates could go to each one.
*  And if you won the district, you would pick up delegates.
*  But the Trump campaign pushed for changes to those rules this year for a winner-take-all
*  system.
*  And now the GOP in California is going to give all 169 of its delegates to a candidate
*  who meets the winner-take-all threshold of over 50% statewide.
*  I mean, that's a very high threshold, a candidate getting 50%.
*  In fact, that seems pretty much tailor-made for Donald Trump.
*  It certainly does if you're looking at all of the polling right now.
*  So in California, the Trump campaign changes the rules, it feels like, so that he and only
*  he can pretty much win every single delegate.
*  And 169 delegates is a fair amount of delegates.
*  He's kind of taking a state off the map for his rivals.
*  Correct.
*  And he is doing it in a state, California, which votes on Super Tuesday.
*  And that is the first week of March.
*  So it is part of a bigger plan to have the nomination wrapped up by the end of March
*  in terms of how many delegates he has.
*  And March is significant for another reason.
*  It's currently when the trial in Washington, D.C., on charges of illegally subverting the
*  election in 2020, is scheduled to begin.
*  Now, it's not likely to begin then.
*  It will be a little delayed.
*  But that's the track it's on.
*  And if that trial doesn't start in March, Alvin Bragg-
*  The DA of New York.
*  May start the Hush Money case, which is also expected in March.
*  So March is a key month for him.
*  Right. And according to the rule changes you have just described, Trump's going to be a
*  lot closer, combined with his poll numbers, to becoming the nominee before or just as
*  those trials are starting.
*  Therefore, he will become the nominee we suspect before there's a verdict in any of those cases.
*  That is correct.
*  Meg, has anyone observed that what the Trump campaign is up to here looks and sounds a
*  lot like maybe rigging, right?
*  A word that Trump uses a lot.
*  Sometimes falsely, but a lot.
*  Yes, people are very upset about this, Michael.
*  Among them is Ken Cuccinelli, who was a Trump administration official and Trump was president,
*  who now supports Ron DeSantis.
*  He used that exact word to Shane Goldmacher and Jonathan Swan in May.
*  He said, quote, they've rigged it anywhere they thought they could pull it off, unquote.
*  We should, of course, point out that everything Trump is doing within the Republican Party rule
*  changes, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is perfectly legal.
*  It's just that it's very aggressive and it clearly exploits his unusual level of power
*  over party leadership.
*  Now, so far, what you're describing is local state level.
*  Does this backroom campaign extend to the national Republican apparatus, to the
*  Republican National Committee itself?
*  Yes, Michael, it does.
*  So remember that Trump, assuming he wins all these primaries, will not officially be
*  nominated as the GOP nominee for president until the Republican National Convention in
*  Milwaukee in July.
*  And you can see a world where he's convicted of a crime and some faction of the party that
*  does not want a nominee who's been convicted of a crime tries to embark on a last minute effort
*  to get somebody else nominated.
*  And so what Trump's team is trying to do is make sure that the rules committee does not
*  have the ability to make a bunch of changes that would favor another candidate and not
*  Trump.
*  And so an example might be a rule that would say you can't be the nominee if you're convicted
*  of a crime or even that you can't be the nominee if you're indicted.
*  Fascinating.
*  And Trump has a lot of allies on the rules committee and they are expected to be watching
*  this process very, very carefully.
*  So we should understand that in the same way that Trump has essentially huge influence,
*  maybe even veto power over state rules, he has that same power over national Republican
*  rules.
*  Correct.
*  And I expect that his campaign is going to try to exert more and more influence over the
*  national party in the coming months.
*  So in a real sense, the Trump campaign has kind of thought of everything.
*  It's thought of how to ensure that no one can really challenge him.
*  He's taking states off the map and he's making sure that if a court case goes against him,
*  the party really can't do all that much about it.
*  That's right.
*  The way to think about this is that the Trump team this time, which is staffed with much
*  more seasoned people than his 2016 campaign, they're trying to eliminate unpredictability
*  at a moment when the court cases create so much unpredictability.
*  So the way to think about Trump's 2024 strategy, especially within the context of ensuring he
*  wins the Republican primary, is that his team is basically building a court proof
*  strategy for what we expect to be a very courtroom bound candidate who could be found guilty of some
*  very serious crimes.
*  Yes.
*  And of course, he is still campaigning and he's not required to be in court right now.
*  He's acting like he's running a typical campaign.
*  He's doing rallies.
*  And that's where you see the other blueprint for this candidacy, the public message.
*  And that's just as revealing as the backroom campaign we've been talking about.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Maggie, let's now talk about this, as you said, second blueprint for Trump's candidacy,
*  the message he's delivering at his rallies.
*  You have been watching and I assume attending these rallies.
*  Mostly watching, recently attending, yes.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next president of the United States,
*  President Donald J. Trump.
*  Okay.
*  So let's start with how Trump addresses the legal questions that we have just been talking
*  about.
*  What exactly is the message he's delivering about all these?
*  So in fact, I was at a rally that he did at the end of December in New Hampshire.
*  Every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists and fascists indict me, I
*  considered a great badge of honor because I am being indicted for you.
*  Thank you very much.
*  He has a bunch of familiar tactics that he uses.
*  He tells his supporters that really these prosecutors are after them.
*  They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you.
*  And in the end, they're not after me.
*  They're after you.
*  I just happen to be standing in the way and I will always be standing up for them.
*  And he's just in the way.
*  But he started wrapping that in new language.
*  It's no wonder Biden and the far left lunatics are desperate to stop us by any means necessary.
*  They're willing to violate the U.S. Constitution.
*  Which is saying that actually it's President Biden who is puppeteering all of this.
*  Joe Biden is a threat to democracy.
*  He's a threat.
*  And that Democrats are the real threat to this country.
*  So, you know, we talk about democracy, but the whole world is watching the persecution
*  of a political opponent that's kicking his ass.
*  It's an amazing thing.
*  I want to zero in on something you just said, which is that Trump is now claiming Democrats
*  are a threat to democracy.
*  That, of course, is complicated, perhaps too many years ironic.
*  Because Democrats, and not just Democrats, view Trump and what he did around the 2020
*  election, the very reason he's in so much legal trouble, as a direct threat to democracy.
*  I mean, he tried to overturn a democratic election he didn't like the results of.
*  So he's trying, and this seems quite strange, to flip that around and say, no, the real
*  threat to democracy is President Biden because his Justice Department has brought some of
*  these cases.
*  Correct.
*  In Trump's telling, Trump has done nothing wrong, of course, and it's that President
*  Biden has weaponized the federal justice system to go after a rival and is even controlling
*  these state-based cases in Georgia and New York.
*  For which there is no evidence.
*  For which there is no evidence in any of it that President Biden is directing this.
*  But it's a sign that Trump and his team know that what Democrats are saying about Trump
*  as a threat to democracy is having some effect in terms of the public.
*  Just explain that.
*  The attacks on Trump and the description of Trump as a threat to democracy, his behavior
*  ahead of January 6, 2021, the things he said about Vice President Mike Pence, these are
*  not pluses with independent voters and some Republicans.
*  And Trump's team is aware of that.
*  And they are concerned about the general election and what those attacks could look
*  like.
*  And so Trump is doing what Trump does best, which is try to muddy the waters and say,
*  actually, it's the other guy doing this thing I'm accused of doing so that voters
*  can't really tell the difference anymore.
*  Got it.
*  So for the most part, he's not really engaging with the cases brought against him.
*  And like you said, he's using them as an opportunity to simply go after Biden.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, talk about the ways that Trump is going after Biden beyond a kind of reverse
*  projection of his legal problems.
*  So he wraps all of his discussions related to the court cases around an attack on Biden
*  where Biden is weakest, which is on the economy.
*  The next economic boom will begin the instant the world knows that crooked Joe Biden is gone
*  and Donald J. Trump is one four more years as president of the United States.
*  And despite a lot of economic indicators looking good, we know that many people don't feel good
*  about the economy.
*  Things cost more.
*  It's difficult to afford a home.
*  When I was at the rally that he did in New Hampshire at the end of December, there was
*  a screen over Trump's head where he showed the mortgage rate.
*  The average monthly mortgage payment has gone from $1,746 under my administration to $3,322
*  today, but you can't get the money, so it doesn't matter.
*  And the point there is things were better when I was president.
*  Put me back in office.
*  You'll have more money in your wallet.
*  As long as Joe Biden is in the White House, the American dream is dead.
*  But all of that will change the minute the polls close on election night 2024.
*  It's a pitch to a lot of voters.
*  The economy is a pretty basic fact in most presidential elections, but it could particularly
*  appeal to independents or suburbanites who turned away from him.
*  Right. So this is the part of the rally where he's not just thinking about becoming the
*  nominee, which, as we talked about through his strategy, he feels kind of assured of.
*  He's now pitching himself to the full American electorate.
*  That's right.
*  And beyond the economy, he spends a lot of time railing against the state of the country,
*  particularly so when he's talking about immigration and crime.
*  You know, when they let, I think the real number is 15, 16 million people into our country,
*  when they do that, we got a lot of work to do.
*  And he made a pretty shocking statement at the New Hampshire rally.
*  They're poisoning the blood of our country. That's what they've done.
*  They poisoned mental institutions and prisons all over the world.
*  That's just he described undocumented immigrants as poisoning the blood of America.
*  I just want to talk to you about that language.
*  What do you think he was doing? Why was he doing it? How should we think about it?
*  Well, it's language that echoes language used by Adolf Hitler.
*  It is language that echoes fascists across history.
*  It's pretty shocking to hear a front runner for one of the two major parties in this country
*  describing undocumented immigrants this way.
*  And it invokes a blood purity that is the language used by white supremacists.
*  And it was not the first time Trump said it, but it was Trump doubling down on it.
*  And in a sense, it's in keeping with how Trump has at times campaigned and talked.
*  You were at the beginning of Trump's campaign in 2016 when he talked about immigrants from Mexico.
*  It's very jarring to hear him do it eight years later.
*  There is always an argument about whether Trump is actually intensifying his language
*  or escalating his language. And he just objectively is.
*  And I will direct a completely overhauled DOJ to investigate every radical out of control,
*  fake, crooked prosecutor in America for their illegal racist and reverse enforcement of the law.
*  The language where he describes black prosecutors who are
*  investigating him as reverse racists is pretty shocking.
*  What he's really saying is they hate white people?
*  Yes.
*  For which there's no evidence.
*  He's not being investigated because he's white, but it does play into his crowd.
*  I think as he has gotten angrier and as he has become more embattled,
*  he has become more emboldened in what he is saying.
*  Right. More willing to take greater risks in the kind of extremeness of what he's willing to say.
*  And ignore people who tell him that this could be very damaging to him down the road,
*  politically. And inciting to people who listen to it.
*  When you think about everything we're talking about here, there's a kind of
*  deja vu all over again. Quality. This is Trump's playbook.
*  And it didn't work for him four years ago. He lost.
*  So how should we think about why it might be more effective in 2024 than it was in 2020?
*  I think the right way to think about the current campaign is that it's more like 2016 than 2020.
*  Hmm. More like the first campaign, which he won, than the second, than he didn't.
*  Correct. In 2020, enough of a percentage of Americans were really tired of Trump.
*  They were tired of the drama. They were tired of the chaos.
*  He had been president for four years. People wanted a change and Trump lost.
*  2016 was the campaign where Trump ran as an outsider against someone who was basically
*  running as an incumbent, Hillary Clinton, who was basically running as a continuation
*  of President Obama. And Trump obviously beat her.
*  This campaign so far feels more like 2016. And Trump is better running as an insurgent
*  than an incumbent. And you're seeing that again.
*  Right. And in a sense, he can run as an insurgent, even though he had been president,
*  because he hasn't been president the past four years.
*  Correct. And because of that, his playbook might be more effective than it was in 2020.
*  Let me just synthesize everything you have, I think, explained. At the end of the day,
*  this is a campaign about victimhood. Does that feel right? I mean, Trump's victimhood in his
*  telling and America's victimhood. Trump's telling voters that he's a victim of these court cases,
*  and he's telling voters, he's telling America that they are victims of Biden's policies.
*  That's what 2024 is going to sound like in the hands of Donald Trump. And I guess the question,
*  based on your reporting and your analysis, your understanding of this race, is,
*  is that potentially a winning message? That is exactly what the landscape is for 2024.
*  And the reason it could be a winning message, and again, who knows, is President Biden's
*  numbers remain quite poor. If they get better, it might not be a winning message. If the economy
*  gets better and in ways that voters feel good about, it might not. But that's basically the
*  message Trump feels he has, and he's going to push it endlessly. And let me ask you this. If Trump is
*  convicted of something between now and the general election next November, does this framework
*  therefore get reinforced and deepened and stronger? Or does it ultimately all actually kind of
*  collapse? Because a conviction is a conviction, and Americans can't wrap their heads around
*  a convicted person being their president. We are seeing data in our own polling,
*  the paper's polling, that suggested that more Republicans, more Trump voters,
*  don't think that he should be the nominee if he is convicted. It suggests to me that people had
*  not really been tuning into what was happening with Trump legally. They will be in 2024,
*  and things may end up looking different. In other words, these court cases,
*  this is where we started, they really do matter. They really do matter.
*  Maggie, thank you very much. Michael, thank you.
*  Over the past few days, Trump's legal problems have only mounted. The Secretary of State in Maine
*  sought to remove Trump from the state's Republican primary ballot, citing his efforts to overturn the
*  results of the last election. Maine joins Colorado, whose Supreme Court ruled a week earlier
*  that Trump could be removed from the Republican ballot in that state for the same reason. For now,
*  Trump remains on the ballot in both states as the cases make their way through the appeals process,
*  and many predict, all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court in the coming weeks.
*  Tomorrow on The Daily, we turn to the campaign strategy of President Biden.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Monday, Israel said that it would begin
*  withdrawing several thousand troops from Gaza, at least temporarily, in what would be the most
*  significant publicly announced pullback since the war began. Israel has been under growing pressure
*  to de-escalate its presence in Gaza, but in describing the pullback, it said the decision
*  was primarily driven by the need to restore normalcy to the Israeli economy,
*  which has been hurt by the massive mobilization of reservists.
*  Meanwhile, in a momentous ruling, Israel's Supreme Court has struck down a law passed last year by
*  the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that was designed to reduce
*  the court's own power. The law, which made it harder for the courts to overrule decisions made
*  by government ministers, touched off mass protests across Israel and raised questions
*  about the health of the country's democracy. In response to Monday's decision, Netanyahu's party
*  rebuked the Supreme Court for issuing what it said was a divisive ruling during a time of war.
