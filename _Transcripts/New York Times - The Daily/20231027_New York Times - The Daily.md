# A New Threat: Surprise Hurricanes
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyszr5qHUzU)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. This is a daily.
*  Today, Hurricane Otis, which killed more than two dozen people in southern Mexico this week,
*  has revealed a new kind of threat that meteorologists fear will become more and more common. A severe
*  hurricane that arrives with shockingly little warning or time to prepare. My colleague Judson
*  Jones explains. It's Friday, October 27th. Judson, we're coming to you because you are a
*  meteorologist on the staff of the Times, which is a pretty new development, I have to think, because I didn't actually know that the Times had a meteorologist on our staff.
*  So I came on about a year ago, last Halloween, and it all came about because the Times wanted to develop an extreme weather team.
*  We often say extreme weather is the fingerprint of climate change. So a lot of times it's the evidence that the world is changing.
*  And so by bringing on a meteorologist and a data journalism team, my team is responsible for diving into the data of these extremes.
*  Got it. So the reality that climate change and extreme weather are deeply interwoven is why you are at the Times.
*  Absolutely.
*  Well, let's turn to the reason we're talking to you right now, which is an extreme weather event that happened just a couple of days ago,
*  Hurricane Otis and why it felt so different to those of us watching it than most hurricanes.
*  What made Otis so remarkable and scary was that it rapidly intensified from a tropical storm Tuesday morning to a Category 5 hurricane by nightfall.
*  Basically went from your one of the mill storm to the most terrifying, powerful, destructive kind of hurricane in less than 24 hours.
*  Yeah, I mean, it was the ultimate nightmare scenario.
*  So tell us the full story of Otis from the beginning, from your perspective as somebody watching it.
*  Well, in full transparency on Wednesday morning, I woke up and went, what happened?
*  Like normally we have a lot of lead up time to hurricanes, right?
*  Like we're tracking them across the Atlantic Ocean or tracking them across the Pacific Ocean.
*  You can see them coming.
*  It gives the forecast models time to initialize and give different results over a couple of days.
*  So there's this chance to kind of understand that the storm is coming here.
*  This storm, Otis is new to the scene in the Eastern Pacific.
*  This is a tropical storm formed on Sunday.
*  It was 40 miles per hour.
*  Otis is pushing its way towards Acapulco.
*  So we're going to see some very heavy rain around the southwest of Mexico.
*  On Monday, it was 50 miles per hour.
*  The forecast models weren't really showing it intensifying at all.
*  Tropical storm Otis continues to spin in the Eastern Pacific.
*  Winds right now 45.
*  Tuesday morning, it was still a tropical storm.
*  So around 50 miles per hour.
*  But by midday, it was 80 miles per hour.
*  It was a category one hurricane strength.
*  It started to look even more like a hurricane on satellite, which kind of gives an indication that it's intensifying.
*  And I started to form.
*  Now let's talk about this one in the Pacific.
*  This thing just jumped up just to a category three.
*  And then that afternoon, hurricane hunters flew through the eye twice and found that it was actually a category four strength hurricane.
*  Now we go to a potentially dangerous situation developing in Mexico.
*  A rapidly intensifying hurricane is making its way toward the resort community of Acapulco.
*  And then later that night, all of a sudden it was 165 miles per hour.
*  The strongest storm that has ever hit the west coast of Mexico.
*  So every hour or every two hours, this thing is becoming like an entire order of magnitude bigger.
*  And that's just not, you're saying, normal.
*  You know, it's one of the fastest strengthening storms we've ever experienced.
*  It is beyond the definition of rapid intensification.
*  The typical definition is 35 miles per hour in 24 hours.
*  This one went above 100 miles per hour in 24 hours.
*  Like it jumped from a tropical storm to a category five.
*  I mean, it's just unheard of.
*  It's remarkable in meteorology terms.
*  OK, so when this very anomalously intensifying storm arrives on the western coast of Mexico
*  as a category five storm, describe for us what happens given the fact that from everything
*  you're saying, there hasn't been very much time at all to prepare.
*  The winds came in howling.
*  I mean, they were ripping off palm leaves and you can see it in video before all the power cut off.
*  Then all of a sudden, you know, these these tourists and the residents,
*  they're nearly a million people live in the city, broken, shattered windows.
*  The sides of buildings were starting to rip off.
*  You know, you can see the rain coming into people's bedrooms, you know, where they're trying to sleep.
*  I mean, this came in normally when people would be sleeping.
*  Right. I think I remember one a.m. local time or so.
*  Yeah. I mean, you just imagine like you think you're just going to sleep through the storm
*  and then all of a sudden the windows are just being shut down.
*  And by the time the sun came up, you know, cell towers were down, Internet was down.
*  It was really difficult to find out what was going on on the ground.
*  But we know now that the damage was extensive.
*  Twenty seven people have died and more are still missing.
*  And so we're seeing a lot of damage.
*  And so we're seeing a lot of damage.
*  And so we're seeing a lot of damage.
*  The damage was extensive.
*  Twenty seven people have died and more are still missing.
*  Which really would seem to highlight the problem of rapid intensification.
*  You don't have time to evacuate people and therefore more people die.
*  Yeah.
*  In this modern age where you expect forecast and people to be able to evacuate,
*  we never want to see anyone die in the storms.
*  As meteorologists, like that's why we forecast.
*  It's to save lives.
*  And so it just goes back to the ferociousness of this storm.
*  Just how unusual is Hurricane Otis given everything you've just described,
*  which makes it feel very unusual.
*  Not as unusual as we hope.
*  I'm afraid that we're going to see this happen more frequently.
*  Studies are showing that rapid intensification is happening more often.
*  I think that's the future we need to prepare for.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Judson, what is the evidence that storms like Otis that intensify in what feels like lightning speed
*  with so little warning are now becoming more common and are not as unusual as you would like them to be?
*  It's one of the things that you can actually attribute to climate change a little bit.
*  There are studies that have shown that typhoons and cyclones,
*  which are just hurricanes in another ocean basin,
*  that they're rapidly intensifying more frequently.
*  Even a study just a couple weeks ago that focused specifically on hurricanes in the Atlantic
*  showed that in a warming world, rapid intensification is twice as likely to happen.
*  So essentially, the thing that tells us that this is becoming more common
*  is people studying old storms and saying, there's no denying this reality.
*  Yeah, even the storms I've covered over the last decade
*  kind of used to feel like something we would occasionally say.
*  Like, this storm is going to rapidly intensify, or that storm just rapidly intensified.
*  And now it almost feels like every storm we cover is just another indication.
*  Right. And I want you to just mechanically explain why this intensification is happening.
*  Clearly, the main driving factor is warming water temperatures,
*  but I want you to just remind us how that works and how a warmer body of water
*  means that a small storm is becoming a massive destructive storm so quickly.
*  Well, to have a hurricane, you need to have warm water.
*  It has to be 80 degrees Fahrenheit or higher to really give it the energy that it needs.
*  Right. So think of a hurricane as like an engine,
*  and that energy, that warm water is the fuel that's fueling the hurricane.
*  Typically, you know, these storms that they sit over an ocean in an area for a long period of time,
*  they continue to pull that energy up into the hurricane.
*  But down below, colder water starts upwelling.
*  So that hurricane is pulling colder water that's replacing that warm water.
*  But what we're seeing in this warming world is that it's not just the ocean surface temperatures that are warming.
*  The column of water is warming.
*  So instead of pulling colder water up into the hurricane,
*  it's upwelling warmer water that is, again, above 80 degrees, which gives more energy to the storm.
*  So instead of a hurricane just kind of petering out because it's lost that fuel,
*  instead, it's pulling more energy into that storm.
*  That's fascinating.
*  So when there's more and more fuel in the ocean for the hurricane,
*  the chances of it speeding up become higher and higher, the chances of it petering out become smaller and smaller.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  So if you're a meteorologist, which you are,
*  how does this new reality of there being so much warm water fuel for these storms to intensify,
*  how does that change your role in warning people about these dangerous storms?
*  It's almost like we turned back the clock a little bit on forecasting.
*  You know, we've come a long way in meteorology, right?
*  Like, if you think back to the great Galveston hurricane in 1900, they didn't have warning.
*  And then the satellite era came and all of a sudden we could see these storms in the Atlantic.
*  And we knew that they were going to move towards the US.
*  So we've constantly been improving.
*  Forecast models have even gotten better.
*  You know, we have this ability to see a storm out in the Atlantic and say,
*  hey, that may hit the US in two weeks.
*  However, when you have this rapid intensification equation, right,
*  like this problem that kind of inserts itself, it kind of changes the game.
*  Right. Kind of undermines all that technology and says to it, you're not up to the task.
*  Yeah. And I mean, I think scientists are quickly trying to develop better models to predict this intensity
*  because it is a scary thing.
*  I mean, we want to warn people and it helps to be able to see in the future.
*  Well, what would help you adjust to this pretty scary new reality about faster intensifying storms?
*  What would help you be able to predict that Otis was going to do what it ultimately did?
*  Are there some straightforward, easy solutions to that?
*  I think one thing is better observations.
*  I think we're getting in an age where we're launching weather satellites all over the place
*  and that's helping improve our forecast.
*  Like having a better understanding of just how intense the storm is ahead of time is key.
*  But even in this situation, it took a hurricane hunter flying through the storm to really know how intense it was.
*  So I think that's one thing. Right.
*  The other thing is the forecast.
*  Like these supercomputers that are trying to predict the future, we need to continue to develop that science.
*  For example, if we had more sensors in the Pacific Ocean, we could get better data
*  and understand what is actually coming from the West to the East or from the East to the West,
*  depending on what part of the Pacific Ocean you're in.
*  Like if we get more data, the forecasts are going to get better.
*  Okay. But even if we get more sensors in the Pacific Ocean and even if we get better forecasts
*  and better warnings on these more quickly intensifying storms,
*  that doesn't solve the problem of helping people on land to prepare when by definition,
*  they just have less and less time given the warming water.
*  So how are we supposed to solve for that?
*  I mean, the straightforward answer would seem to be we need to cut back on emissions,
*  which is clearly a root cause of these warming temperatures creating these nightmare scenarios.
*  But even if we did that, that would take time. So what do we do now?
*  If you live in a coastal community and you're getting less and less time to prepare for a hurricane, what can be done?
*  A lot of it ends up coming down to mitigation.
*  It comes down to as simple as building materials. Right.
*  Like there are things called hurricane ties that you can get for a few bucks to hold down your roof
*  to the rest of the framework of your house so the roof doesn't blow off.
*  There are things that can be done to help mitigate that disaster.
*  Another thing is, you know, not building in floodplains where we're seeing a lot more of that.
*  But then it's also having shelters readily available that are hurricane proof or tornado proof.
*  Like there are things that cities and towns and countries can do to help mitigate the disaster
*  by giving people options if they're in the path of a major storm.
*  Right. Options that increasingly perhaps need to acknowledge that there might not be time to get in your car
*  and drive for hours and hours.
*  But are contingency plans that perhaps recognize that you may end up needing to stay in your community
*  when one of these storms very rapidly becomes something super dangerous?
*  Absolutely.
*  I'm curious, just thinking about the fact that you are a meteorologist,
*  if this situation we're describing makes you feel an immense amount of pressure to get things righter than ever before.
*  I mean, there's always lots of carping when a meteorologist gets something wrong.
*  You told us to worry about a storm, it passed us, we're annoyed with you.
*  But the burden now feels even more intense because if you're wrong,
*  the amount of time, the room for error is vanishingly small.
*  And the danger is so much greater.
*  And that puts you in a very tricky position.
*  Yeah. I mean, meteorologists have always gotten it wrong.
*  You know, that's why it's a joke because it's a science.
*  Meteorologists, what they're doing is creating a hypothesis.
*  So when they're forecasting, when a meteorologist like myself is giving you a forecast,
*  they're giving their best educated guess based off of everything that's happening around.
*  So as I write these stories and am trying to forecast these bigger storms,
*  being right is not easy.
*  I feel responsible for what people may think by reading those words.
*  Like, should they evacuate? Should they not evacuate?
*  Is this storm actually going to be a big deal?
*  And I carry a lot of that weight on my shoulders.
*  And in this world where storms can intensify and kind of come out of nowhere,
*  it's not the kind of storm I like to wake up to the next morning and go,
*  oh, I should have covered this two days ago so people had more warning.
*  Right.
*  I want to be able to warn people three or four days in advance of a major hurricane.
*  And when they rapidly intensify next to a city with nearly a million people,
*  that is the worst nightmare.
*  Well, Judson, thank you very much. We really appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  A massive manhunt entered its second day in Maine where police were searching for the gunmen
*  who killed at least 18 people at a restaurant and bowling alley
*  in America's deadliest shooting of the year.
*  Police described the suspect as a Sergeant First Class in the Army Reserve,
*  where his superiors became alarmed over statements he had made over the summer
*  threatening his own unit.
*  All Maine people are sharing in the sorrow of the families who lost loved ones last night,
*  loved ones, normal people who were killed or injured while unwinding from the day of work
*  or while spending time with their family and friends socializing.
*  During a news conference, Maine's Governor, Janet Mills,
*  called the shooting a dark day for the state and for the city where it occurred.
*  I know that the people of Lewiston are enduring immeasurable pain.
*  I wish I could take that pain off your hearts, off your shoulders,
*  but I promise you this, we will all help you carry that grief.
*  And on Thursday, the Israeli military said it had briefly sent tanks into northern Gaza
*  in preparation for its next stage of fighting, which could involve a ground invasion.
*  In Gaza, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said that the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli airstrikes
*  has surpassed 7,000 people, but those numbers cannot be independently verified
*  and have been questioned by President Biden.
*  In response, Hamas released what it said were the names of 6,747 people who had died.
