# A One-Man Blockade Against the U.S. Military
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOf-XdNFPc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. This is The Daily.
*  For the past few months, a single Senator, Tommy Tuberville, has blocked hundreds of
*  promotions within the U.S. military as a political protest against the Biden administration.
*  Today, my colleague, Karan Demirjian, explains what's behind his blockade
*  and why military leaders say it's becoming a threat to national security.
*  It's Monday, July 24th.
*  Karan, tell us about this Republican Senator, Tommy Tuberville, who is very much at the center
*  of this month's long drama. So Tommy Tuberville is probably best known to the general population
*  as a storied coach of the Auburn University football team. Tommy Tuberville is getting
*  another shower. He took Auburn to more wins over Alabama than anybody else had, and that was his
*  whole public persona until he decided to stage his first political campaign. The way I was raised,
*  before a football game, you stood to honor America, and after the game, you knelt to honor God.
*  And run for Alabama's Senate seat in 2020. So I'm getting off the sidelines and into the fight.
*  As your senator, I'll have President Trump's back. We can't be bought, and we won't back down.
*  And he wins. Right. So Tuberville arrives in Washington three days before January 6th.
*  Obviously, D.C. is in turmoil, and we don't hear that much from him except for, you know,
*  he's one of those mega guys that's newly in office in 2021. It isn't until the next year,
*  in the summer of 2022, frankly, that the issue that will end up defining him starts to emerge,
*  and that is that the Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade, and that creates this patchwork of
*  different abortion laws in various states around the country. And so people are scrambling to figure
*  out how to navigate this new patchwork of our post-Roe world, and one organization that faces
*  a lot of pressure to do something is the Pentagon. The military has a bit of a unique situation.
*  They deploy service members to states all over the country in places with different levels of
*  access to reproductive care. Right. And so the question becomes whether they're going to dictate
*  a policy that will equalize that playing field for all different service members regardless of
*  where they're stationed. So if you're based in Massachusetts, you have a relatively equal ability
*  to access abortion, reproductive care, whatever that may be, as somebody based in Alabama,
*  because members of the military don't get to choose where they're stationed. Right. Suddenly,
*  a couple of dozen states are banning abortion, and service members might be in those states,
*  or they might be in states where it's perfectly legal in a post-Roe world.
*  Absolutely. And it takes the Pentagon a good long time to come up with what its policy is going to
*  be. It isn't until February of this year that they actually say, okay, what we're going to do
*  is we're going to offer time off and travel reimbursement to anybody who needs to go out
*  of state to obtain an abortion or some other form of reproductive care that is not offered
*  in the state where you're stationed. And Tommy Tuberville says, oh no, you're not going to do that.
*  And why is he upset about this government solution to a post-Roe world for soldiers who might need
*  abortions? Well, there's two reasons. Politically, it's pretty clear where Tuberville is coming from.
*  He's coming from Alabama. He ran on a very, very conservative Republican platform. And for him,
*  the logical place that plays well at home, given where his state is, given where he has been
*  politically, is you don't vote for abortion. You don't enable abortions to happen. That doesn't
*  work with your brand of Republicanism. The other argument that he makes is that it's illegal,
*  that there are federal laws that say you cannot spend money on an abortion. And his argument is
*  spending money to facilitate an abortion is basically the exact same thing. And so he issues
*  an ultimatum to the Pentagon and says, if you go ahead with this policy, I am going to prevent you
*  from being able to promote any of your generals or your admirals, because the Senate actually has to
*  say, okay, we approve for those things to happen. It's really rare that somebody actually says,
*  I'm not going to allow uniformed senior members of the military to move up in rank because it's a
*  leadership issue in the military. And it's kind of one of those third rails that politicians don't
*  touch, but Tuberville did. And that was the threat that he made. And what is the response from the
*  military, from the Biden administration to that threat? They basically ignore it and they go ahead
*  and they implement the policy anyway in March. And so when the next batch of senior military
*  promotions comes up on the Senate floor, Democrats try to move it through and Tuberville says,
*  no. The senior senator from Alabama, Reserving the right to object. I object. He makes good on the
*  threat. I'm holding the DOD nominations because the secretary of defense is trying to push
*  through a massive expansion of taxpayer subsidized abortions. And he makes this speech explaining
*  I told you what the terms were. I told you what I needed you to change about this policy. I was
*  not okay with you putting it in place. You did it anyway. So I'm doing what I threatened that I would
*  do. I object and I will continue to object to any nominees as long as this illegal new abortion
*  policy is in place. Americans want a military focused on a national defense. And that's what
*  I'm fighting for. Okay. Well, explain how Tuberville, a single senator whose party,
*  the Republican party is in the minority in the Senate, has the ability to be a one-man
*  blockade on any promotion in the senior ranks of the U.S. military. Cause that seems hard to wrap
*  your head around. Right. So this gets into the rules and the arcane guts of how the Senate
*  operates. It's a very strange place, but basically to be able to do anything without having to jump
*  through a series of time sucking procedural hurdles, you need what's called unanimous consent.
*  You need all the senators just be like, okay, I don't care. Go ahead, do it. And then you can
*  get a whole lot of things done that would otherwise suck up a whole lot of time on the floor.
*  Military promotions are one of these things that traditionally have been done by unanimous consent
*  because everybody supports the uniformed military. Right. But that means any one senator has outsized
*  influence because they can deny you unanimous consent. All of a sudden when you have one
*  senator saying, absolutely not. No, you don't have that unanimity. And that's what gives Tuberville
*  the ability to have a one-man blockade against basically the entire military and the entire way
*  that things have happened in the Senate for decades upon decades. So Tuberville has successfully
*  exploited a funky little logistical reality of unanimous consent. Yeah, he does. And then he
*  does it again and again and weeks go by. And then the question becomes for everybody else,
*  how do we get Tuberville to stand down? He and the defense secretary have a phone call a few weeks
*  into the protest and the defense secretary tries to explain why it's a bad idea. And Tuberville is
*  not convinced. And he leaves that call and says, nope, this was not enough for me. I want this
*  policy changed. His GOP colleagues in the Senate also are really not comfortable with what he's
*  doing. There's a lot of defense hawks in their ranks. They are not comfortable messing with the
*  military's ability to do its job. But the most that they're willing to say publicly, at least at
*  the outset is, you know, I agree with your protest in substance, but do you have to do it this way?
*  Because remember, the GOP also doesn't like abortion and they don't like this Pentagon policy.
*  More weeks go by. And in that time, Democrats try over and over and over again to bring up
*  these promotions to get them through the floor. And every time Tuberville is there saying no,
*  I object. And so what becomes clear is that Tuberville is demanding this issue be settled
*  by an act of Congress. But Tuberville's fundamental complaint is, is that the administration,
*  the Defense Department should not have been able to do this on their own. And what he wants is for
*  Congress to actually dictate what the policy should be. That means either an act of Congress
*  to force the Pentagon to undo their policy on abortion access or proactively passing a law that
*  says that policy, that's the law. And if they fail to do that, if lawmakers can't get that law through
*  Congress, he wants the Pentagon to revoke its policy.
*  Huh. So for him, it's an all or nothing approach. And it doesn't sound like one that's kind of
*  logistically and politically likely to go his way, because of course, the Senate is controlled by
*  Democrats. So this just keeps dragging on week after week, month after month. And I'm curious,
*  what becomes the impact of this one man, all or nothing blockade?
*  As the blockade goes on, the backlog of these senior uniform commanders who haven't been
*  promoted grows and grows. So what was initially dozens becomes hundreds. It's also now becoming
*  really visible and tangible because it's affecting the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Now, the Joint Chiefs
*  of Staff are made up of the most senior uniformed officials in each of the branches of the services.
*  They're also, as a body, the top military advisory crew for the president. And over the
*  course of the summer, we may end up in a situation where over half of the Joint Chiefs don't actually
*  have Senate confirmation, as is traditional process. They will be places occupied by acting
*  officials, but those are temporary and they don't have the authority and the blessing of Congress to
*  make changes, to make decisions about policy. And that's really what's setting off alarm bells now.
*  One in five members of the U.S. military are women. Abortion laws in this country that are
*  now being passed are absolutely having an effect on their willingness to continue serving in uniform.
*  And you're starting to hear senior members of the military.
*  This is a national security issue. It's a readiness issue. And we shouldn't kid ourselves. I think
*  any member of the Senate Armed Services Committee knows that.
*  The Secretary of Defense, the White House.
*  The idea that we're injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions, what in fact,
*  as a domestic social debate on social issues, is bizarre.
*  Saying this is becoming a real problem and could actually affect our military readiness
*  and our ability to respond to threats around the world.
*  Right. If there's one organization in the U.S. government where you want people to firmly be in
*  their jobs and for there to be no question about their authority and its power, it is the United
*  States military and it is especially the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
*  Right. Because their counsel, their advice is considered to be pivotal for the president.
*  And the president's the commander in chief. And so this really goes right up to the top now
*  about how much authority do they have to give that counsel and how is that affecting the
*  United States' standing in the world.
*  I'm really curious what Senator Tuberville says in response to all these senior military people
*  saying very pointedly, you, Senator, are making the military weaker with this blockade,
*  with this protest. You must stop. National security is at risk.
*  First of all, he's not buying their argument that the sky is falling.
*  And he's also saying, well, if you think so, change your policy because it doesn't help military
*  readiness and defense, he says, to be focused on things like providing abortion access.
*  We should be talking about defense and that's it. And these are extraneous issues that that's what
*  makes us weaker. That's his take. And frankly, he's getting a lot of support for this, both from
*  people at home in Alabama and even increasingly so in Washington, where a lot of far right
*  Republicans in the House have basically taken up his cause and made this a fight against the
*  Pentagon, not just to undo the abortion access policy, but a whole bunch of other social
*  policies that they say should be more conservative. We'll be right back.
*  So, Karen, describe exactly what it is that Senator Tuberville seems to have helped inspire
*  over in the Republican controlled House. So over the months that he's objecting,
*  there's a group of far right Republicans who are actually coming to physically show their support
*  for Tuberville in the back of the Senate chamber when he makes these objections.
*  And then it becomes time for the House to do its annual defense bill. This is something the House
*  tackles every year. It's basically Congress setting the rules of the road for how the Pentagon can
*  spend the money, the taxpayer money that Congress eventually appropriates for them. And they demand
*  an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would basically bar the Pentagon from
*  being able to implement this policy for service members that would need to leave the state for an
*  abortion. So they basically put Tuberville's plan in their bill. They put Tuberville's plan
*  in their bill and they succeed in getting it attached. One, because a couple of Republicans
*  in the House also have outsized power because the GOP's majority is so, so slim, but also because
*  Republicans don't like the policy. And so when you put it to the floor, the GOP is hard pressed
*  to vote against it. Even if they're worried, it might blow up the whole defense bill. And actually,
*  the far right Republicans managed to do a lot more. They go after health coverage for people
*  transitioning gender and say, you can't spend money on that in the military. They go after the
*  diversity training initiatives and they stop just short of saying you can't spend money on it at
*  all. But they say, we're going to cut all the offices and all the personnel that are tasked to
*  those offices to actually teach about diversity, equity and inclusion in the military. So they take
*  what Tuberville is up to, which is pretty narrow, take the issue of abortion out of the military and
*  they broadened it. And they are basically trying to take all social issues they don't agree with
*  out of the military. Right. The military thus becomes a forum, at least in the House's defense
*  bill for these culture wars. And what ends up happening to the bill is that you took a defense
*  bill that started off as a bipartisan product with support from Democrats. And by the time you're
*  actually voting on it, loaded up with all of this stuff, almost no Democrats are willing to support
*  it anymore. And so what you have left is a GOP backed bill. And that's kind of a unique situation
*  because normally you end up having a bipartisan vote for these defense bills. That's the goal.
*  And for the last 60 years, Congress as a whole has managed to annually pass a defense bill.
*  But that's in doubt now because you can't get this bill with all of these conservative social
*  policy clawbacks through a Democrat backed Senate. And that could fundamentally change
*  Congress's relationship overseeing the military. Right. Because you're saying it's quite likely
*  in the coming weeks or I guess months that the Senate might not pass this defense authorization
*  bill. And suddenly the military's budget would be in doubt. The Senate's working on its own
*  defense authorization bill version right now. And it's not going to look anything like the House's
*  bill on these issues. After this, they have to appoint negotiators to go work out a compromise.
*  The question is, can they actually compromise? And whatever compromise they strike, can it get
*  through both of these chambers? Usually the answer is yes, because Congress thinks that continuing
*  to direct how dollars should be spent in the military is a super important thing. But the
*  answer to that question is a big question mark right now, because there's such a split on these
*  social issues that really cut to the core of each party. Right. So at this point,
*  Tuberville has seemingly emboldened his far-right Republican colleagues to make social issues so
*  central to the way that they think about the military that it may end up jeopardizing the
*  military's funding in a very unusual way this year. Right. Usually if you have disputes over
*  social policy as part of the whole defense bill, they start to go away by the time you actually
*  strike a compromise. But the far-right Republicans have been emboldened. They realize the outsize
*  power that they can have even in small numbers, and they are not inclined to make a deal.
*  Mm-hmm. I'm curious if Republican leaders have either a plan or the power to end what Tuberville
*  is doing, and I guess by extension, sending a message to House far-right Republicans to stop
*  what they are doing. Well, the thing is, they don't. Unless you change the rules of the Senate,
*  you can't really stop one Senator from objecting. Unless you miraculously find dozens more
*  Republicans to give you a bigger than a five-vote majority in the House, you can't really change
*  the fact that the far-right Republicans in the House have a lot of power. And the leaders of the
*  party, knowing that they're between a rock and a hard place, are not talking as tough as a lot of
*  the mainstream Republicans and Democrats want to see them talk. They're not threatening these guys
*  in ways that they want to see happening, at least not openly, because they really don't have
*  their hand on that lever to pull the kill switch and make this stop.
*  So back to the beginning of our story here, Karin, how does this all come to an end? How does this
*  one-man blockade end, does it ever end, if Tuberville wants to keep doing what he's doing?
*  Well, first of all, I should say that Tommy Tuberville has basically rejected the idea
*  that you can settle this under the defense bill, because he thinks that Congress is too split,
*  and it's true, to actually be able to get it done that way. And he's making these demands for
*  standalone bills that, frankly, could never pass both the House and the Senate in similar ways.
*  So that's not very practical. The only way to get through Tommy Tuberville's blockade right now
*  seems to be to go around Tommy Tuberville's blockade. And what does that look like?
*  That means the Senate has to start putting these nominees one by one, up for votes on the floor.
*  The concern is, if you have to do that for every single one of the promotions that are stuck in
*  this backlog, you would be on the Senate floor for weeks on end if you went 24 hours, seven days a
*  week, which is not how they work, months on end if you actually parcel it out so it's something akin
*  to a normal work day, and you wouldn't be able to get very much else done.
*  Right. This is the virtue of unanimous consent. It avoids having to spend hundreds,
*  thousands of hours trying to get military promotions through the Senate.
*  It's efficiency when it comes to things that should be pretty non-controversial.
*  Yeah. And so now the question being laid at the feet of the Senate majority leader,
*  Democrat Chuck Schumer, is, are you going to do that to get your Joint Chiefs in place?
*  And even if you say, okay, fine, we'll do that. We'll relent on the Joint Chiefs. We'll make that
*  a special issue. What about everybody else? There's still no conclusion on the hundreds of other senior
*  officers, commanders, who are still stuck in that backlog and need to see those promotions get through.
*  Right. So it doesn't look like Chuck Schumer is going to take this laborious,
*  time-consuming approach for all the hundreds of promotions that are in this backlog. That's
*  what you're saying. It's the equivalent of shutting down the Senate floor for a long,
*  long time to anything else. But also remember, it's not just about what you happen to have time to
*  do this month. It's what precedent do you set for the future? Right. And they are very, very concerned
*  about saying, this is a legitimate protest that we will engage with. Because what about the next
*  time somebody has a complaint with the Pentagon policy? What if everybody could have their way
*  on niche issues by threatening to block hundreds of promotions for months on end?
*  You wouldn't actually be able to ever get any laws passed, even in a season where, you know,
*  you'd need to. So what would it look like for Senator Tuberville to prevail here and for the
*  military and the Biden administration by extension to cave and give in on this abortion access
*  policy so that it can get the military appointment process back to normal?
*  It would not be unprecedented for the Biden administration to cave on a social policy
*  to Republicans. This actually happened recently when they said, okay, we'll take down the COVID
*  mandate. That was more of an argument that happened in the Contours of Defense bill.
*  But there's something very different about this one. We're heading into a presidential election
*  year next year. And Democrats think that the abortion issue for them is a winner on the
*  campaign trail. They did better than they were expecting to in the midterm elections because
*  they campaigned on Roe v. Wade. Right. They want to still paint the GOP as extreme on abortion and
*  a whole bunch of other social policies because they believe that will get them votes to keep a
*  Democrat in the White House. If they give up on this, that is undermining what is supposed to be
*  a signature central campaign issue. And so the long-term consequences of that could be pretty
*  severe at the ballot box. So they can't politically afford to cave on this issue and the result
*  is going to be a somewhat dysfunctional U.S. military. Yeah, at least organizationally.
*  And the thing is, we don't know how long that's going to go on and what the repercussions are
*  going to be in the long term. Because frankly, right now, Tommy Tuberville seems like he can
*  continue this blockade for just about as long as he wants to.
*  O'Karen, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In Israel, over the weekend, tens of thousands of people marched to the capital city of Jerusalem
*  in a last ditch protest against their government's plan to reduce the power of the country's highest
*  court. That plan, which is supported by the far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu, is expected to be adopted today. Netanyahu and his supporters say it's necessary
*  to prevent the left-leaning court from repeatedly overruling his government.
*  But opponents say it's a dangerous power grab that will endanger Israel's democracy.
