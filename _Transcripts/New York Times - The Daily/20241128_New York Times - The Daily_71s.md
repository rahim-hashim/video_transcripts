# In The Kitchen with Ina Garten
**New York Times - The Daily:** [November 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk)
*  Heyo. It's 641 a.m. and we are on the Long Island Expressway. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=0.0s)]
*  For most of you, Thanksgiving is going to mean either hosting or being hosted for a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=11.94s)]
*  very special meal. So yeah, we're going to be sitting in traffic for quite some time. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  And when we thought about that, our minds immediately went to the great host of our [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=22.44s)]
*  times, Ina Garten, aka the Barefoot Cantessa. And she invited us into her [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=27.04s)]
*  absolutely idyllic home, led us into her barn, which is her test kitchen. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=33.36s)]
*  Thank you so much. That's really sweet. We don't have to drink it, but we could. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=39.0s)]
*  And there, she taught us how to make the perfect glazed ham that is completely [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=44.08s)]
*  ready by the time you walk in her door. Ham? I mean ham. And how to make the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=49.36s)]
*  perfect seasonal cocktail. In this case, it was a cranberry martini. And for your [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=54.8s)]
*  benefit, we recorded the entire thing and it is today's daily. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd7UwJIccVk&t=61.08s)]
