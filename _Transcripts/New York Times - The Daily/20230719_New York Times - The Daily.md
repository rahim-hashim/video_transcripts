# How the Birth Control Pill Got Over the Counter
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xZFqQdSrWg)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroweth. This is The Daily.
*  Last week, for the first time in U.S. history, federal regulators approved the sale of a
*  birth control pill without a prescription. Today, my colleague Pam Bellick unwinds after
*  decades of brutal battles over contraception, this decision played out so differently.
*  It's Wednesday, July 19th.
*  So Pam, when I saw this news story pop up that the birth control pill had been approved
*  to be sold over the counter for the first time, I imagine that there was some sort of
*  story of a bruising battle between reproductive rights groups and social conservatives who
*  have typically been opposed to things like abortion and contraception. But then we called
*  you and you said, nope, this was actually a very uncontentious fight that just played
*  out. So I am surprised and confused. Help me.
*  Yeah, you know, it was really striking to me too, that when this thing kind of got to
*  the point of a decision being made, there was overwhelming support and even pressure
*  from many people to get this approved. And the conservative voices that are typically
*  against this were very quiet. And given how controversial and how much of a flashpoint
*  contraception has been over the decades, this was a really interesting moment. It was really
*  notable that in this case, you didn't have a lot of strong voices opposing it.
*  So Pam, what is the beginning of this story? How did we get here?
*  So the birth control pill was developed mostly in the 1950s. And it was approved first by
*  the FDA in 1960.
*  They come in big bottles for a year's supply, smaller bottles for a month's supply and handy
*  calendar packs.
*  It was absolutely groundbreaking for women and for reproductive health.
*  How effective is it?
*  If taken as it should be, 100%.
*  You know, there was really nothing else out there that was as effective that people could
*  obtain. You know, it's much more effective than condoms.
*  It stops ovulation. So there is no egg.
*  And for the first time, women were able to control their own reproductive choices and
*  they were able to take control of when they wanted to get pregnant. And so it becomes
*  a huge influence in women being able to go into the workforce, to be able to control
*  how many children they have. And it really is just transformative for American society.
*  Right. It sounds like it's not an exaggeration to say that in giving women more control over
*  when they get pregnant, the pill really transforms their lives. It allows them to work for longer.
*  It leads to the kind of gender picture in the job market that we have today, which is
*  closer to parity than it was half a century ago.
*  I mean, it's a catalyst for pretty broad changes.
*  Yes. But of course, there was a backlash.
*  In the 1960s, you had the pope and Catholic leaders opposing birth control, except for
*  the Rhythm Method. You also had a branch of the NAACP and later other black leaders registering
*  opposition as well because they were concerned that this was going to be used as a tool to
*  try to keep the black population down.
*  Wow.
*  And there was some history that they drew on to sort of support that because the development
*  of the pill was in part funded by people who supported eugenics. And the first birth control
*  clinical trials were conducted in Puerto Rico among women who were relatively poor.
*  So that sort of feeds into what's going on here in the 1960s.
*  And then, interestingly, there was also a bit of a feminist backlash. There were concerns
*  being raised about the health side effects of the pill. None of them were very, very
*  severe. But the idea that you have generally a white male medical establishment,
*  kind of promoting birth control that women would use, fed into concerns that feminists
*  were having about the patriarchy and whether men were basically trying to tell women what to do.
*  So the pill is facing opposition from different quarters. And at the same time,
*  American women are interested in oral contraceptives.
*  It's getting increasingly popular. There's growing demand for it.
*  It is estimated that perhaps one out of every three American women married between the age of
*  15 and 44 has used or is using the oral contraceptives.
*  And as with all thorny issues in American society,
*  this one gets catapulted to the Supreme Court.
*  And the Supreme Court makes one very key decision in 1965 that says that there's a constitutional
*  right to contraception for married couples. And then later in 1972...
*  It says, you know what?
*  That 1972 decision on contraception comes a year before Roe, right? When the Supreme Court says
*  there's a constitutional right to abortion. That's right. It's really a time period of
*  major change and big barriers to contraception, to reproductive health access are being upended.
*  So you have millions of American women taking the pill. Even majorities of American Catholics
*  are using contraception and some of them are using the pill. Really?
*  Yeah. And by the 80s, you have lots of different companies starting to develop different types of
*  birth control pills. And so there's just a lot of innovation in the field of birth control pills.
*  Right. And that innovation is in itself an indication that there's been a meaningful
*  enough break in the opposition to contraception and the birth control pills specifically,
*  that these companies see a real market there that they want to get it on.
*  Yes. So by the early 1990s, you have reproductive health experts who are
*  floating this idea of getting a pill that could be available without a prescription.
*  There's even a little burst of discussion with the FDA about this. There are academic articles
*  written about this. And so this idea starts to sort of get into the social bloodstream
*  a little bit. But at the same time in the 1990s, the issue of abortion starts to really become
*  a more contentious issue with the religious right. And contraception just kind of gets
*  pushed to the side as an issue that people are talking about. But the issue of whether a pill
*  should be over the counter is still quietly burning in the background. And you have scientists that
*  are doing research. They're trying to answer some key questions for the medical community.
*  They're trying to make sure that they can document that it's safe to use without a prescription,
*  that it won't keep women from going to the doctor for other reasons, like pap smears and things like
*  that. And by the early 2010s, they have really convinced the medical establishment and you have
*  major medical organizations in reproductive health coming out with official statements saying,
*  we think there ought to be an over the counter birth control pill.
*  And do their recommendations have an impact on the debate or on policy at this point?
*  Not right away. And part of that is because at the same time that this is happening,
*  you have other reproductive health fights that are really in the spotlight.
*  Tonight, I return to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future.
*  The Obama administration has come in. And that is the issue of health care.
*  And one of their first priorities is the Affordable Care Act to expand
*  access to health care. And one very controversial aspect of that is that the government mandates
*  coverage of prescription birth control, including prescription birth control pills.
*  On January 20th this year, the US Department of Health and Human Services approved a mandate that
*  will force Catholic employers to violate their consciences and fund practices that to them are
*  morally offensive. The anti-abortion forces are against that and they start conflating
*  the birth control pill with abortion and the morning after pill. The scope of this mandate
*  included drugs that can prevent the implantation of the new embryo. Therefore, in our view and that
*  of many others, is really abortifacient. They start falsely saying that the morning after pill
*  is an abortion pill and blending that together with other types of contraception. And another
*  issue that they have is this concern that making all kinds of reproductive health care more available
*  might encourage teenagers to be more sexually promiscuous. There's no evidence that this is the
*  case, but this is a conservative argument. And so all of this really sucks up all the oxygen
*  in this arena. And the idea of trying to get an over-the-counter birth control at this point
*  is kind of a non-starter and nobody brings it up for another few years.
*  So this gets drowned out again by the abortion fight?
*  Yes. It basically recedes from public view and it doesn't get thrust back into the spotlight
*  until 2022 when Roe v. Wade is overturned.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Pam, what's the story of how the pill comes back into focus once Roe is overturned?
*  So it turns out that in 2016, a French company partners with an American reproductive health
*  group and they decide that they are going to do the studies and the research needed to put together
*  an application to the FDA for approval of an over-the-counter pill. And so they're doing all
*  the studies that they need. And at the point where this is already, they submit their application
*  to the FDA in July of 2022.
*  Wow. So right after Roe is overturned.
*  Yeah. It's like three weeks after Roe is overturned. And it's a coincidental timing. It's not like they
*  saw the Supreme Court decision and said, we're going to submit this now. They were just ready
*  to do that. But the timing becomes really important because abortion access starts to
*  get taken away in half of the States. And not only that, Justice Clarence Thomas,
*  in a concurring opinion to the decision that overturned Roe, starts to raise the prospect
*  that some other Supreme Court precedents might drop away, including the precedent allowing for
*  the right to contraception access.
*  Right.
*  So you get a huge groundswell of concern about contraception, about the need for it,
*  about whether it's going to be taken away. And when the application for this pill comes before
*  the FDA, the public is really paying attention.
*  And how does that manifest? What does that look like?
*  So the FDA has what's called an advisory committee hearing before they make the decision. And before
*  that, there's a period where people can post comments for the FDA and the advisory committee
*  to see. Usually you get some pro, some con, but in this case, you got hundreds of comments,
*  and almost all of them were in favor of the over-the-counter pill and really saying how
*  necessary it was, especially now.
*  Good morning and welcome.
*  And you get that same dynamic at the advisory committee hearing in May, which I listened to.
*  It was a two-day hearing.
*  Speaker number 27.
*  And there is just a parade of like three dozen people who are speaking about what they want to happen.
*  Hello, my name is Divya Weidron. I am 19 years old and I'm from McAllen, Texas.
*  When I was 16 years old, I became sexually active.
*  Coming from a very religious community.
*  There's some really impassioned and very kind of emotional statements, especially from young people
*  who are saying that they had a really hard time getting prescription birth control when they tried.
*  When I finally mustered the courage to open up to my parents and disclose that I needed a new form
*  of contraception to help me feel safe, I was met with a stern no and a grounding. I was told that
*  if not being given birth control would stop me from being active, then so be it. And so I continued
*  having sex without birth control, all because I could not access it under the prescription only system.
*  So you have young women, teenagers.
*  For too long, I shied away from signing my name on the law to be seen out of fear that I would be
*  judged or seen as irresponsible for seeking control over my reproductive health.
*  Women of color.
*  If O-PIL were available over the counter, rural youth could access this life-changing care online
*  with ease.
*  With people representing rural communities.
*  I'm asking you to please consider making birth control over the counter with no age restrictions.
*  It could be life-changing for many of us.
*  And good afternoon. My name is Lisa Haddad and I'm an OBGYN with subspecialty training
*  in complex family planning.
*  There are statements from doctors who are saying,
*  while deep and meaningful interactions with health professionals are often helpful to some patients,
*  these visits are often brief and are not required before a patient starts to use contraception.
*  Look, we prescribe this pill and we want to cut ourselves out of the process.
*  This will not prevent women from having discussions with providers.
*  Your decision can help millions to have easier access to effective contraception.
*  We do not see any reason for us to be there writing these prescriptions when it is perfectly safe
*  and much easier for women if they can just pick it up in a CVS or, you know, in a convenience store.
*  This is important, necessary, and urgent. Thank you for your time.
*  So it's just a very kind of a dramatic and moving series of statements that you don't always get at
*  these kinds of federal hearings.
*  I'm Susan Musket, president of Pro Family Women, and we oppose this proposal to allow
*  over-the-counter access to the O-PIL contraceptive pill.
*  I think there was at least one person who spoke against it.
*  A key issue is whether the FDA will allow minor girls over-the-counter access to O-PIL
*  without their parents' permission.
*  I think she was mostly concerned about the issue of whether this would be available to young people
*  and whether they should be still required to get it by prescription.
*  We will now adjourn this meeting. Thank you.
*  But most anti-abortion groups, most conservative activists were just really not saying anything
*  about this. And believe me, they do weigh in on every abortion-related issue very strongly.
*  So it's notable when they are quiet about something, when they're not even really mentioning it.
*  What was clear from the public comments was that there was overwhelming support.
*  What was not clear was whether the FDA was actually going to approve this.
*  They had some safety concerns about whether this was a good idea to make it available
*  over-the-counter. But ultimately, they did approve it. And what they said was the safety concerns
*  that they had might still be there, but that they were far outweighed by the public health need and
*  the public health benefit of giving people access to over-the-counter birth control.
*  But Pam, what happened to the strong feelings about contraception that we saw during the
*  Obama years and the forces behind them? Why aren't we seeing a bigger backlash?
*  Well, I think there are a couple things going on here. One is that, once again, abortion and
*  the battle over abortion is kind of soaking up a lot of the oxygen and energy on the anti-abortion
*  side. So even though they won with the Supreme Court decision, there are a lot of things that
*  they are battling for and trying to protect in the states where anti-abortion laws are being passed.
*  And so there's a lot of energy that they're spending trying to do that. And they're also
*  trying to get a national abortion ban. And I think also the popularity of contraception is so great
*  that many people on the conservative side don't really want to take that on. That's not where
*  they want to spend their political capital right now. So they are choosing not to engage
*  in fighting that right now. So they're both busy pushing the anti-abortion agenda even further.
*  And they see restricting contraception as not really a winning issue because it's so popular
*  and they're kind of saying it's not worth it to focus on that. That's true. And also,
*  for some Republicans, you even have right now in some of the Republican states that are banning
*  abortion, some of them are taking small steps to try to expand access to birth control by,
*  say, passing legislation to allow pharmacists to prescribe it or extending Medicaid coverage to
*  certain types of contraceptives.
*  Explain that to me. Why are Republicans all of a sudden behind expanding contraception?
*  Well, I think there are some Republicans, not all, but some, who see that if you are extinguishing
*  the right to abortion, you really ought to spend more effort trying to prevent
*  unplanned pregnancies. And logically, of course, if you expand access to contraception,
*  you're going to lower the number of unplanned pregnancies and lower the need for abortion
*  for some people. So there are some people who are connecting those dots. And I think that's part of
*  the landscape here.
*  It's fascinating. It's like in a country where now abortion is much harder to access,
*  it's becoming harder to make the argument, to thread that needle, that you should not be
*  allowed to have an abortion. And you also shouldn't be allowed to help yourself avoid being in the
*  position where you need one.
*  I think that's true. However, I would also say that certainly you don't see a lot of
*  Republican leaders at the national level coming out and championing contraception in the same
*  way that Democrats are. Some of the support is sort of support by not voicing opposition,
*  rather than coming out and saying, this is an issue we want to get behind and we want to really
*  expand contraception access.
*  Okay, understood. Pam, I just want to reflect for a moment on what feels like a really remarkable
*  moment that we're in, which is that at the same time as anti-abortion groups have won this huge
*  victory in overturning Roe versus Wade and abortion access is withering away in many parts
*  of the country, we also have the exact opposite thing happening with the pill. It's now going to
*  be available over the counter. It just feels hard to understand how these two things are happening
*  at the same time. How do you interpret that?
*  I think it's the kind of thing that sounds like a huge contradiction, but is actually very logical
*  when you consider how these issues work kind of together and how they play off one another.
*  When you have one side having a big loss in terms of access to abortion, then you have them really
*  getting energized and throwing everything that they can behind getting a win.
*  The stakes are very high. They are putting everything they can behind getting a win on those
*  stakes. You have a situation where, unlike what we were talking about before, where there was a time
*  when this issue was getting drowned out by a lot of reproductive health issues, right now, this is
*  actually an issue that people are paying attention to. The removal of guaranteed access to abortion
*  has made people focus a lot more on other things like contraception. In a sense, the timing was
*  right for this kind of decision to happen. That makes me wonder what's going to happen now.
*  How transformative do you think this move to make birth control available without a prescription
*  will be for women? The big question is going to be how much will this pill cost and will people be
*  able to afford it? We are waiting for the company to set a price. We're waiting to see whether
*  insurance will be required to cover it. So affordability here is really key. If that happens,
*  then I think it will be really transformative because the people who really need this kind of
*  access to the pill are going to be young women, teenagers, women living in poor communities, in
*  rural communities. It's really challenging to find the time and spend the money to travel to see
*  a doctor or go to a clinic for a prescription. This pill is going to be available at the gas
*  station, at a convenience store, on just a shelf next to the aspirin, on Amazon. And so if the price
*  is right, I think that will increase access for an awful lot of women. And given where this whole
*  story started in the 1950s, it's really kind of remarkable that we are now in an era where
*  birth control pill can be available right off the shelf.
*  Pam, thank you. Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. In a sign that former President Donald Trump is likely
*  to be indicted for a third time, he has received a letter from the Justice Department saying that
*  he's the target of a federal investigation into his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
*  The letter means that prosecutors have gathered substantial evidence linking Trump to a crime,
*  but it does not guarantee that he will be charged. And so far, it's unclear exactly what those charges
*  might be. Trump repeatedly sought ways to hold on to power after losing the 2020 election,
*  including by making false claims of election fraud, pressuring local officials to find him
*  more votes, and inviting his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol on January 6th.
*  And on Tuesday, North Korea detained an American soldier who crossed into the country without
*  authorization. The Times reports that the soldier was on a tour of the heavily guarded security zone
*  between North and South Korea when he broke away from the tour group and ran across the border.
*  The U.S., which has no diplomatic relationship with North Korea,
*  is now working with North Korea's military to negotiate the soldier's release.
