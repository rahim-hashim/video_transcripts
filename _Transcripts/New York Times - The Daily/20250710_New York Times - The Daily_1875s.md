# What to Expect From Trump’s New Trade Drama
**New York Times - The Daily:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroweth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=4.5s)]
*  After months of delaying his most extreme tariffs, President Trump is now threatening [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  to revive the most aggressive version of his global trade war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=15.68s)]
*  Now America's trading partners, investors, and consumers are bracing for impact. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=20.46s)]
*  Today I speak with three of my colleagues, Ana Swanson, Maggie Haberman, and Ben Castleman, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=27.36s)]
*  about what we can expect and what Trump's endgame might be. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=33.4s)]
*  It's Thursday, July 10th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=43.96s)]
*  Welcome to the Roundtable Economic Edition. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=51.84s)]
*  Ana, nice to have you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=55.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=57.36s)]
*  Ben, thank you for being here in the studio. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=58.36s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=60.86s)]
*  Maggie, it is always a pleasure. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=61.86s)]
*  Natalie, it is so nice having you here, even if I'm not actually with you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=63.56s)]
*  We wish you were here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=67.76s)]
*  I want to just set the table for us a little bit. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=69.64s)]
*  Ninety or so days ago, Trump instigates a global trade war on a scale that the world [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  has never really seen before. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=77.28s)]
*  Reciprocal tariffs on a bunch of countries. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=79.16s)]
*  It's this seismic economic event. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=81.84s)]
*  The US stock market plunged. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=84.88s)]
*  Trillions of dollars in value are wiped out in a matter of days. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=86.72s)]
*  I honestly can't remember an economic event like this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  And then because of all that fallout and the outcry, Trump presses pause on a lot of it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  The stock market recovers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=100.96s)]
*  And then everyone gets kind of used to the idea that the trade war is on what seems like [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=103.6s)]
*  a hiatus. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  Now it feels like to the degree that it was ever suspended, the trade war is back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=110.68s)]
*  He's lobbing these new threats against countries again on Wednesday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  So Anna, can you just lay out for me the current state of play? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=127.64000000000001s)]
*  So actually this trade war was paused, but it never truly went away. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  The president had paused his tariffs for 90 days in April to try to encourage other countries [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=134.28s)]
*  to come to the United States and do trade deals instead of getting hit with tariffs. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=141.5s)]
*  And in the last three months, we've seen this flurry of activity with other countries trying [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=147.24s)]
*  to get some time on the schedule of US officials to negotiate these deals. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=152.56s)]
*  But in the meantime, the president did actually go ahead with other tariffs on cars and steel, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=158.5s)]
*  copper, pharmaceuticals. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=165.7s)]
*  So even though the biggest global tariffs have been paused, tariffs have been steadily [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=168.12s)]
*  rising. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=174.94s)]
*  And right now the overall average effective tariff rate for the United States has climbed [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=176.06s)]
*  up to 17.6%, which is actually the highest that the United States has had since 1934. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=181.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=188.1s)]
*  So it might have felt paused, but it's actually kind of on in a way that does not feel insignificant. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=189.1s)]
*  It's real. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=195.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=196.46s)]
*  It is on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=197.46s)]
*  Of course, they're overshadowed by what the president is threatening to put in place just [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=198.46s)]
*  in a matter of a few weeks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=202.96s)]
*  He's now moved his deadline for countries to negotiate deals or face tariffs to August [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  1st. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=210.94s)]
*  A lot of countries are working toward these trade deals, and we've seen two of them announced [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=211.94s)]
*  so far, pretty limited deals. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=216.22s)]
*  But for many, many more, the president is sending out these letters that are going out [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=219.5s)]
*  globally this week informing countries of the high tariffs that their products will [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=224.06s)]
*  be charged as of August 1st. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=229.02s)]
*  I just want to quickly ask about the deals that have come. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=231.54s)]
*  Ana, can you just tell me what are those? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=234.86s)]
*  How should we be thinking about them? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=238.6s)]
*  So one that the president announced with the United Kingdom in May is really what I would [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=240.46s)]
*  call kind of a framework deal. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  So the two sides agreed to lower tariffs on some certain products. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=248.36s)]
*  And then for a bunch of other things, they basically said, we're interested in cooperating. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=253.56s)]
*  Let's keep talking. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=257.5s)]
*  Got it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=258.5s)]
*  The other big announcement that we've seen was with Vietnam last week, the president [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=259.5s)]
*  said on his social media that he had reached an agreement with Vietnam to lower tariffs [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=264.02s)]
*  on some of their products to 20 percent with a higher tariff on some products that would [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=269.9s)]
*  come from China and that Vietnam would open their markets to U.S. products. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=275.78s)]
*  However, nobody has since released any text of the deal or even any fact sheets spelling [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=280.97999999999996s)]
*  out what was agreed to with Vietnam. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  So we really don't know at this point if there is a deal, what it actually includes. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=288.38s)]
*  The only thing we have is the president saying on his social media account. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=293.64s)]
*  So not a ton of clarity. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not a lot of clarity. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not a lot of substance for 90 days. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=300.1s)]
*  But again, I also don't think that's particularly surprising because doing trade deals is hard [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=302.74s)]
*  and it takes a long time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=308.5s)]
*  And I think, you know, the administration and the world is kind of starting to see that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=309.74s)]
*  Maggie, it's interesting he keeps pushing this deadline back. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=315.3s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=320.42s)]
*  What's he up to? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=321.42s)]
*  Well, President Trump has a history of moving deadlines, as we know, both in terms of his [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=322.42s)]
*  life as a real estate developer and also from his first term in office. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=327.91999999999996s)]
*  He tends to buy himself more time to jump from one lily pad to the next. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=331.88s)]
*  And that's really what this is. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  If you look at everything with Donald Trump as an ongoing negotiation, then this makes [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=338.58s)]
*  sense and follows a logical pattern. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=344.0s)]
*  The problem is that countries engaged in trade can't really function that way. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=346.35999999999996s)]
*  And so what's going on here is he is buying himself more time to come up with something [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  that he can call a win, whether that is, you know, a bunch of frameworks for trade [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=356.74s)]
*  deals or he is trying to see whether there is some other kind of a mitigating factor [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=362.5s)]
*  he could get in terms of an announcement about a company moving production to the U.S. and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=367.08s)]
*  so forth. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=372.1s)]
*  But it's a pretty broad range, Natalie, of what he would consider a win. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=373.1s)]
*  It's too early to say that this isn't working, you know, but it certainly is not the success [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=376.90000000000003s)]
*  that Trump believed it would be. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=382.5s)]
*  I'm interested, Ben, in whether it surprises you that there have been so few deals up until [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=385.1s)]
*  this point. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=390.98s)]
*  I mean, I understand that it sounds like the threat has not worked, but, you know, there [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=391.98s)]
*  were a lot of countries on this list that were going to get hit by tariffs on Liberation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=397.42s)]
*  Day, as he called it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=402.18s)]
*  Why didn't they come to the table? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=404.16s)]
*  I mean, what's going on there? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think on one level it's not surprising, right? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=408.86s)]
*  The idea of 90 deals in 90 days was never plausible, right? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=412.90000000000003s)]
*  Trade deals take years to negotiate. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=417.06s)]
*  But I think that for a lot of these countries, you know, one, their leaders have their own [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=419.38s)]
*  domestic concerns. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=423.26s)]
*  They don't want to be seen as caving to Trump. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  And look, you know, Maggie made the point a moment ago about, you know, Trump having [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=427.22s)]
*  a history of pushing out deadlines and backing down on some things. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=430.78000000000003s)]
*  I think that has been noticed by foreign leaders. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=434.42s)]
*  And there's a recognition that, you know, hey, if we, you know, string this out for [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=436.78000000000003s)]
*  a while, maybe we can get out of some of this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=441.18s)]
*  Maybe some of this doesn't actually end up hitting us as hard, at least, as being threatened. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=443.62s)]
*  I think that is definitely true. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=447.86s)]
*  The countries have realized that they can kind of, you know, have some elastic approach [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=449.5s)]
*  here in terms of what Trump will tolerate. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=453.58s)]
*  But there's a point that an economic expert made to me about how Trump seems to view these [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=456.22s)]
*  tariff impositions as he keeps describing them, which is I set the level, you do what [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=461.26s)]
*  I want, you give up the terms that I want, and otherwise you're going to be punished. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=466.22s)]
*  But some of these countries have seen that he doesn't necessarily abide by the deal frameworks [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=470.78s)]
*  he says he's going to anyway. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=476.26s)]
*  So they don't have a ton of incentives to come forward and make concessions because [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=477.97999999999996s)]
*  who knows what happens after that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=483.58s)]
*  I just want to step back and think for a moment here about like what the point of all of this [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=485.58s)]
*  is for the Trump administration. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=490.9s)]
*  There are two big kind of ideas behind all of this, as far as I understand it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=493.23999999999995s)]
*  Start manufacturing back to the United States and raise money through these additional tariffs. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=498.64s)]
*  Where are we been on those fronts, on the impacts of all of this so far? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=504.2s)]
*  And I want to first start with the easier of these two, the raising money part. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=508.12s)]
*  How much money has been raised? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=512.34s)]
*  How big of a deal is it? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=514.66s)]
*  We're bringing in tariff revenue at record setting rates. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=516.34s)]
*  You know, as Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary, referred to having collected about $100 billion [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=519.96s)]
*  in tariff revenue. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  That's a little misleading because we already collected tariff revenue, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=526.72s)]
*  So it's about $50 billion of additional tariff revenue, but that's real money. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=530.64s)]
*  But it's important to remember who's paying that, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=535.32s)]
*  That's being paid by importers, right? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=537.94s)]
*  Which means American companies. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=541.1600000000001s)]
*  And one way or another, that's going to end up passing through into the American economy, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=543.38s)]
*  whether that's through the companies being paying it and losing it in their profit margins [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=547.88s)]
*  or ultimately getting passed on to consumers. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=552.26s)]
*  So yes, it's revenue for the federal government, but it's revenue that you and I in some form [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=555.42s)]
*  or fashion are ultimately paying. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=559.9s)]
*  But is that true? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=561.88s)]
*  Because I'm wondering if we've actually seen the price increases that we were warned about. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=563.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so I think it's funny, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=570.14s)]
*  Because the president is saying, oh, you know, tariffs are going to bring back manufacturing [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=572.66s)]
*  jobs. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=575.8199999999999s)]
*  So far, we've been losing manufacturing jobs. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=576.88s)]
*  Critics are saying, oh, tariffs are going to raise prices and slow down the economy. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=579.4599999999999s)]
*  So far, prices have continued to moderate and the economy has remained relatively solid, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=583.34s)]
*  right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=588.5s)]
*  So on some level, it's sort of defying all the narratives and the economy is kind of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=589.5s)]
*  trucking along. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=593.0600000000001s)]
*  Wait, can you just pause on that for a second? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=594.0600000000001s)]
*  Are you saying the prices haven't gone up? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=596.22s)]
*  Yeah, so it's complicated. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=598.4200000000001s)]
*  Overall inflation has continued to cool, right? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=601.4s)]
*  So we have not seen this sort of big jump in consumer prices. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=603.7800000000001s)]
*  If you zoom in and if you look at products that we're importing from China, for example, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=607.38s)]
*  you do see some evidence that some of that is picking up, but not in a sort of a crazy [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=612.7s)]
*  way. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=617.1s)]
*  And even though, as Anna said, we have seen higher tariffs than we've seen historically, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=618.1s)]
*  it's not at this sort of wild level that was being threatened back in April. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=622.86s)]
*  And so instead, what we see is this sort of gradual impact, gradual erosion that's going [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=627.58s)]
*  to take time to play out in the economy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=632.82s)]
*  But for now, at least, even with this kind of historically high effective tariff rate, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=635.46s)]
*  we're not seeing prices go up yet, is what you're saying. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=641.3s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=644.5799999999999s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=645.8199999999999s)]
*  Does that mean companies are largely eating the cost of the tariffs, the $100 billion [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=646.8199999999999s)]
*  because that surprises me. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=652.54s)]
*  I think it has surprised a lot of people, but maybe it shouldn't have, right? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=655.18s)]
*  It's going to take time, even in the best of circumstances, for companies to sort of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=659.26s)]
*  figure out how they're going to make their pricing decisions, right? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=663.5799999999999s)]
*  It's not like tariff hits and you immediately pass on that price, right? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=666.88s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=670.46s)]
*  And companies, because they saw this coming, rushed to buy products, to import products. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=672.06s)]
*  We saw a huge surge of imports in the first months of this year as companies rushed to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=677.66s)]
*  bring things in before the tariffs hit. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=682.62s)]
*  What that means is they've got a whole bunch of inventory that's sitting there that they [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=684.78s)]
*  didn't have to pay the high tariffs on and that gives them a little bit of wiggle room [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=687.78s)]
*  to make some decisions about how they're going to pass on these prices or not. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=691.18s)]
*  And then you have this uncertainty element. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=695.58s)]
*  You've got all of these companies that are sitting here saying, I don't know what the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=697.82s)]
*  – as Anna was saying, I don't know what the tariff is going to be. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=701.1400000000001s)]
*  I don't know what my material costs are going to be. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=704.5s)]
*  And so I think that there's a reluctance to make big decisions. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=708.0600000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of sort of putting it on hold and that's true on the price level, but it's [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=712.22s)]
*  also true on hiring, on investing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=715.74s)]
*  There's just kind of a pause in a lot of parts of the economy right now. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=718.1800000000001s)]
*  And then of course there's the fact that when this first happened, you had some big [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  companies start to say, we're going to raise prices. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=727.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm thinking of Walmart. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=729.6s)]
*  And Trump comes out and really hammers them. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=731.12s)]
*  Maggie, I'm wondering if you think there's any chance that in addition to what Ben is [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  saying that there's a part of this where companies are seeing that and eating the cost because [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=738.76s)]
*  they just don't want to piss Trump off. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=743.72s)]
*  I think that's 100% a reality here and I think that is where you see tariffs as a weapon [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=745.24s)]
*  that he uses domestically, not just with countries overseas or companies that might be based [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  elsewhere. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=756.28s)]
*  He has shown that he is willing, Natalie, not just to publicly name and shame, which [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=757.28s)]
*  is part of what you're talking about. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=762.24s)]
*  You know, we certainly saw him do it, say, with Jeff Bezos when some element of Amazon [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=763.52s)]
*  was listing what the impact of the tariffs would be on certain products. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=768.32s)]
*  It wasn't across the website, but there was some aspect of it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=772.24s)]
*  And that was undone in like an hour. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=775.76s)]
*  Anna, I want to turn now to bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=778.16s)]
*  That was the stated goal of these tariffs, right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=783.52s)]
*  And obviously, manufacturing wasn't going to come back in three months. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=786.76s)]
*  But do we see any signs that companies are moving in that direction, that they're at [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=790.76s)]
*  least trying to move some of their operations back to the U.S. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=797.16s)]
*  as a result of all the tariff pressure they're seeing? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=800.68s)]
*  So in the data so far, it seems like, no, we're not seeing evidence that, for example, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=804.08s)]
*  company spending on new factories is increasing. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=812.48s)]
*  It looks like company spending on new manufacturing facilities has kind of trended downward in [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=816.6s)]
*  the last few months since Trump came into office. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=823.08s)]
*  We've also seen a loss in manufacturing jobs in recent months. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=826.4s)]
*  So the overall jobs numbers for the United States have been strong, but that's actually [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=830.4s)]
*  been buoyed a lot by health care and, you know, certain sectors. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=835.28s)]
*  Actually, factories are losing thousands of workers in the last few months. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And I think to piggyback on what Anna's saying there, the way that these tariffs [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=843.8000000000001s)]
*  have been rolled out have really sort of undermined some of the president's stated [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=848.64s)]
*  goals on this. And I hear that when I talk to economists, but also when I talk to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=852.76s)]
*  businesses. So if you're a business right now, if you're a manufacturer thinking like, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=855.88s)]
*  hey, maybe I should step up my manufacturing in the U.S., you really don't have the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=860.12s)]
*  information you need to make that bet. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=864.1600000000001s)]
*  You don't, you know, you say, oh, I'm going to enjoy some protection here from these [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=866.5600000000001s)]
*  tariffs. And then they get removed a month later or they never take effect. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=870.0400000000001s)]
*  And so I think that even to the extent that these policies might sort of theoretically [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=874.32s)]
*  work, this set of policies as they've actually been implemented is not likely to yield [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=878.84s)]
*  that result. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's a great point. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=885.48s)]
*  And I mean, moving supply chains takes, you know, many months can take years and [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=887.12s)]
*  billions of dollars. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=892.0s)]
*  Right. So these are long term investments. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=893.24s)]
*  And the president has been moving in contrast on kind of a daily or hourly timeline in [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=895.6s)]
*  terms of shifting the strategy. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=901.0s)]
*  He's also been working from a framework as if it is still 1990 something. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=902.96s)]
*  You know, we are in a very different economy. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=907.0400000000001s)]
*  A lot of what he is looking to restore is going to be it's not just that it takes [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=909.76s)]
*  time. It's that it's so impractical for some of these companies. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=913.52s)]
*  You can take Apple as an example. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=916.64s)]
*  To Ben's point, I'm not sure how much of this is going to materialize the way he [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=918.72s)]
*  believes it will. And I certainly know Tim Cook made that clear to him. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=922.9200000000001s)]
*  I feel like what all three of you are sort of saying is that we are just in really early [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=926.44s)]
*  days here. We don't quite have a verdict on this. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=930.88s)]
*  And maybe it's sort of misguided to even be measuring this by short term gains. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=933.72s)]
*  Yeah. Why are we doing this episode at all? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=941.48s)]
*  I think what we can say with confidence right now is one, there are costs to these [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=946.0s)]
*  policies that are ultimately going to be borne by the American people in one form or [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=950.56s)]
*  another. And the benefits, whatever they might be, are not likely to be as clear as [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=956.0s)]
*  they might be if these policies were rolled out in a different way. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  We're going to pause for a break because Ben, not only are we doing this episode, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=971.56s)]
*  but we're going to do a whole other half of this episode. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=975.96s)]
*  And when we come back, we're going to talk about some of the bigger potential impacts [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  of all of this tariff drama. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=983.92s)]
*  We'll be right back. Ben, I have to ask about one of the big fears that has been [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  baked into all of this from the beginning, which is a recession, the idea that [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1001.8399999999999s)]
*  companies could pull back on hiring and expanding, that people would lose jobs, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1006.68s)]
*  the economy would shrink. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1011.0s)]
*  That does not seem to have happened. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1012.88s)]
*  We've seen good job numbers month after month. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1016.2399999999999s)]
*  How should we think about the economy right now, Ben? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1020.28s)]
*  Yeah. So I think that if you, again, go back to that April 2nd period, there were a [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1023.12s)]
*  lot of Wall Street forecasters, economists who were warning of a real risk of an [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1027.72s)]
*  imminent recession as a result of that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1033.72s)]
*  But then Trump pulled back. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1036.44s)]
*  And so what we're seeing now instead are predictions that rather than that being [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1038.0s)]
*  this one acute thing that looks like a big recession, that it's more kind of a [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1042.8s)]
*  slow drip. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1047.04s)]
*  Somebody compared it to a Brexit scenario. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1048.56s)]
*  Britain leaves the European Union, and instead of there being sort of some [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1051.64s)]
*  immediate recession, their economy is just weaker for an extended period of time. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1055.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. The sky didn't fall in the case of Brexit either. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1060.0s)]
*  Like we're not seeing some major meteor hit. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1064.2s)]
*  Yeah. But we know from other evidence that Americans are not feeling good about [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1068.3200000000002s)]
*  the economy. And we saw a real decline in all measures of consumer confidence early [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1072.1200000000001s)]
*  in Trump's term. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1077.8000000000002s)]
*  What's interesting is we went to the same thing under Biden, when voters didn't [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1079.64s)]
*  feel good about the economy, but they kept spending money and the economy [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1085.3200000000002s)]
*  basically looked okay. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1089.24s)]
*  And here we are sort of again in the same realm of voters don't feel good, but [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1090.48s)]
*  they're continuing to spend and we don't see that much evidence of economic damage. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1094.96s)]
*  Maggie, do you get the sense that there's any hesitancy in the White House right [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1098.64s)]
*  now about restarting these tariffs? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1102.64s)]
*  You know, like that pushing for these broader tariffs now might have a negative [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1105.0400000000002s)]
*  impact on the economy when you have all of these vulnerabilities potentially with [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  voters around this, you know, at a moment when they don't feel that good about it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1113.88s)]
*  Yeah, people keep saying to me Trump's poll numbers are sliding and it's really [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1118.28s)]
*  choose your own adventure. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  His numbers are actually pretty stable. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1124.6s)]
*  They've gone down a little bit, certainly on how the voters view him in terms of [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  the economy. That has changed on that specific question. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1129.8s)]
*  And that's a warning sign for him. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1132.4799999999998s)]
*  Where his advisors get concerned is that he has turned talking about tariffs into [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1134.36s)]
*  his entire public facing economic discussion. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1141.0s)]
*  And that does risk having voters start to get concerned about what it means for [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1144.12s)]
*  them and maybe make that association of, oh, this is why, you know, my paycheck [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1148.32s)]
*  is not going as far as it was. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1152.04s)]
*  But Trump has proven remarkably durable at being able to keep saying something [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1153.48s)]
*  that isn't necessarily the case and having his voters believe it. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1157.7199999999998s)]
*  I just want to make sure I'm getting this. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1162.48s)]
*  Maggie, you're saying his numbers on the economy have changed, like people have [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1164.6799999999998s)]
*  kind of soured on him in that respect. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1169.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1171.24s)]
*  If you look at the cross tabs, Natalie, on Trump, I'm paraphrasing on what the [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  exact question is, because every pollster asks it a little bit differently. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1176.56s)]
*  How people feel about his handling of the economy. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1180.2s)]
*  It used to really be his calling card. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1183.1200000000001s)]
*  It was his strength over Hillary Clinton in 2016. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1184.8400000000001s)]
*  It was certainly his strength over both Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1187.32s)]
*  That is now underwater, that specific metric. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1191.6000000000001s)]
*  There are warning signs that voters are not happy. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1194.88s)]
*  It's just not that they are necessarily saying, and therefore I wish Trump wasn't [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1198.1599999999999s)]
*  president or, and therefore I don't want Republicans to be in power. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1204.2399999999998s)]
*  One thing to remember about this president, Natalie, is he has, to be fair to him, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1209.0s)]
*  been saying, you know, that NAFTA was a terrible deal for 30 years, but he, he [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1214.36s)]
*  didn't discard NAFTA, he redid a version of it, right? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1219.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, like we're not looking at like an entirely wholesale change in trade. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1223.68s)]
*  What you just said, Maggie, is sort of that while Trump talks about kind of [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  re-imagining the global system of trade and these kind of big maximalist terms, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  at the end of the day, what we've seen in his record is that he, he does a deal. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1242.72s)]
*  He is making changes, but he's not upending the whole system. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1248.16s)]
*  No, well, he's upending the whole system in the sense that there's a lot of chaos [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  and unpredictability, right? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1256.1599999999999s)]
*  And people don't feel like they can know what's happening day to day, but [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  inconsistency is not an entirely changed dynamic, and this is not some whole new [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1261.36s)]
*  economy, you know, he is a developer who, yes, he has built some properties like [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1267.6399999999999s)]
*  Trump Tower, but often what he does is he takes over somebody else's partly built [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1272.72s)]
*  property or a property that didn't work and then changes them into a Trump property. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1278.08s)]
*  And there's some aspect of that now, what he is doing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1282.32s)]
*  We've been talking about a situation in which Trump is not building something for [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1286.4s)]
*  scratch, he's not remaking the system out of whole cloth, you know, companies are [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1290.72s)]
*  maybe betting on that. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1295.92s)]
*  I'm wondering if China, if the relationship with China is the exception. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1297.68s)]
*  You know, it's been the stated priority of this trade war for a long time now. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1303.92s)]
*  Anna, is that still the case? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1310.24s)]
*  Does Trump still have his eyes trained on China? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1312.16s)]
*  Is he still wanting to go big, at least in his aggression, trade wise, with that [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1314.56s)]
*  country? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1320.72s)]
*  You know, it's true that the subtext of a lot of these global trade negotiations [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1322.08s)]
*  has been about China. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1327.84s)]
*  So with Vietnam, part of what the president said had been agreed to is that [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1330.32s)]
*  the Vietnamese will have lower tariffs on products that they send, but then higher [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1336.3200000000002s)]
*  tariffs on products that have a certain amount of Chinese content in them. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1341.6000000000001s)]
*  But it's really not clear how the United States is going to enforce that. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1346.64s)]
*  But we know that's something that they've been discussing with other nations in Asia, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1351.2s)]
*  Malaysia, for example. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1356.3200000000002s)]
*  It's something the Trump team has brought up with Europe and Mexico. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1358.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1362.72s)]
*  That does seem directed at isolating China, right? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1363.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1366.48s)]
*  I mean, there's definitely a kind of global effort to look at Chinese products that are [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1367.52s)]
*  getting into the United States through other countries and finding these loopholes into [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1374.16s)]
*  the United States. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1378.64s)]
*  So that activity has been going on since the first Trump administration when we had [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1379.8400000000001s)]
*  really high tariffs on China. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1384.24s)]
*  And there definitely is part of the negotiations right now that aims to counter that. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1386.16s)]
*  I want to turn to the markets here because we saw that after Liberation Day, the first [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1393.76s)]
*  kind of April tariff day, the market seemed to play a pretty outsized role in moving Trump [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1400.24s)]
*  to scale back, to put those tariffs on pause. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1405.76s)]
*  Do you think that the market's going to react to this new chapter of the trade war the way [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1410.96s)]
*  that it did last time? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1417.68s)]
*  Do we have any early signs of that? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1418.88s)]
*  And if not, why? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1420.96s)]
*  I mean, so far, they certainly have not. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1423.2s)]
*  And it seems that for the most part, investors are betting that this is a bluff again and [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1425.68s)]
*  that there will be further extensions. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1430.88s)]
*  Now, that raises the risk that if these actually do take effect and it looks like they're [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1433.28s)]
*  going to stick, then the markets will react in a much larger way. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1437.76s)]
*  There are hints of concerns among bond buyers that are related not just to tariffs now, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1442.24s)]
*  but also to this big, beautiful bill and the trillions of dollars that it added to the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1448.8s)]
*  debt. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1453.52s)]
*  I think that's where the concerns are now in the bond market, which could end up having [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1454.16s)]
*  a real impact on Trump and what he's able to do. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1458.16s)]
*  But we're not seeing the kind of violent reaction that we saw back in April. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1461.84s)]
*  Okay, just stepping back, I want to think about where we are here and the reality that [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1467.6s)]
*  Trump is still in this kind of half in half out trade war. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1473.28s)]
*  I want to talk about how we think about that in the larger context of how Trump uses his [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1477.84s)]
*  power. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1483.6799999999998s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that the president has been remarkably successful at exercising [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1484.24s)]
*  his power over all kinds of realms in these first several months of his term and basically [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  forcing many people to bend to his will. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1495.6s)]
*  Congress, universities, law firms, Iran even. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1500.24s)]
*  Why does it seem like these trade deals are exempt from that or like the one thing that [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1504.3999999999999s)]
*  seems to be beguiling him? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1509.9199999999998s)]
*  Maggie? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1512.1599999999999s)]
*  Because you can't, threats work to a point with global trade and with global markets, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1512.56s)]
*  but they have their own sets of concerns and dynamics and behaviors. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1520.24s)]
*  He has levers that he is able to push and pull with say universities or law firms that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1525.44s)]
*  he was threatening with executive orders or even individuals. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1532.48s)]
*  You can't force the markets to bend to your will the same way. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1537.04s)]
*  You can't force other countries to bend to your will the same way. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1542.3200000000002s)]
*  And what ends up happening is because the world is built on alliances. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1546.4s)]
*  You risk pushing countries toward your adversaries, not closer to you, not just militarily, not [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1550.48s)]
*  just in terms of defense alliances, but in terms of trade and in terms of all kinds of [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1557.0400000000002s)]
*  other dynamics. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1560.64s)]
*  And I do think the backing off hurts him. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1561.92s)]
*  I think on some fundamental level, Trump has been able to rewrite the political rulebook [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1565.8400000000001s)]
*  in the US. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1570.5600000000002s)]
*  He's been able to write the legal rulebook to some degree in the US thanks to both Congress [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1571.76s)]
*  and the Supreme Court. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1576.16s)]
*  He can't rewrite the rules of economics. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1577.44s)]
*  And there's this fundamental level that he could go and impose these steep tariffs on [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1580.8000000000002s)]
*  China, on the European Union, all of these countries. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1586.0s)]
*  He apparently has the power to do that, but he can't control what happens as a result [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1589.44s)]
*  of that. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1594.16s)]
*  And I think if you're a company right now, you do not have the confidence that whatever [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1594.72s)]
*  gets put in place is going to be the long run reality. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1599.8400000000001s)]
*  And so there's going to be a lot of hedging of bets. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1602.88s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of spreading around of supply chains and probably some inefficiencies [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1604.72s)]
*  that result from that. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1610.56s)]
*  Danielle Pletka Anna? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1611.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, I agree with Ben. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1613.6799999999998s)]
*  I think the economy is a really big and complicated place. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1615.52s)]
*  So we don't immediately see some of the effects of these tariffs, but they are there and they [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1619.12s)]
*  are real. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1627.2s)]
*  It's hundreds of billions of dollars that the United States is collecting and that has [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1627.76s)]
*  real implications for trade and for companies. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  Ben, I'm just struck by the fact that you said that he can't rewire the economy, right? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1638.32s)]
*  But at the same time, it appears like he is doing all of these really big things to put [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1644.08s)]
*  his stamp on it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1649.84s)]
*  Ben Meacham I do think this is Trump's economy now, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1651.6s)]
*  right? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1654.48s)]
*  He spent the first several months of his term trying to blame things on Joe Biden. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1654.64s)]
*  I won't take any view as to how voters will view this, but certainly he's been able to [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1659.92s)]
*  put in place the tariffs that he wanted to put in place. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1663.6s)]
*  He's been able to get his tax bill through. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1666.16s)]
*  He blamed some things on Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, but he's going to get his own Fed [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  chair starting in May when he gets to appoint somebody. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1673.44s)]
*  So we are at a point where whatever happens in the economy, there's no one to blame or [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1676.8000000000002s)]
*  no one to take the credit if things work out other than him. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1681.68s)]
*  This is his economy at this point. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1684.72s)]
*  Thank you guys so much for being here. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1686.16s)]
*  We really appreciate your time. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1696.72s)]
*  Thanks, Natalie. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1699.28s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1700.8s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1701.36s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1702.24s)]
*  On Wednesday, President Trump posted letters informing a host of additional countries that [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1703.04s)]
*  they should prepare for double digit tariff rates, bringing the number of countries facing [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1716.56s)]
*  new tariff threats to 22. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1721.84s)]
*  The highest tariff rate that Trump threatened was 50% on Brazil. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1725.44s)]
*  The Brazilian president responded by saying the country would retaliate. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1729.76s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1742.4s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1747.04s)]
*  In Texas, the authorities confirmed that at least 119 people had died in the recent flooding [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1749.44s)]
*  and more than 170 remain missing. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1755.84s)]
*  Raising the prospect that the death toll could climb much higher. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  Officials have struggled to answer questions about their response to the floods and whether [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1763.12s)]
*  a lack of warning sirens and insufficient disaster planning may have made the tragedy worse. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1767.6799999999998s)]
*  When asked about investigating what went wrong, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said that those [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1774.1599999999999s)]
*  kinds of questions were the words of losers. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1778.96s)]
*  He compared disaster response to football and said only one person had died. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1782.48s)]
*  And said only losing teams focused on their failures. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1787.44s)]
*  And new data on Wednesday showed there have been more measles cases in the United States [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1795.2s)]
*  in 2025 than in any other year since the virus was declared eliminated in 2000. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1800.8s)]
*  More than 1,288 people had a confirmed case of the measles this year. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1808.0s)]
*  92% of them were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1813.3600000000001s)]
*  Most of this year's cases were tied to an outbreak that began in January [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1819.0400000000002s)]
*  in a Mennonite community in West Texas and then spread to New Mexico and Oklahoma. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1823.1200000000001s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Diana Nguyen, Sydney Harper, and Olivia Natt. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjlhMDX90w&t=1831.8400000000001s)]
