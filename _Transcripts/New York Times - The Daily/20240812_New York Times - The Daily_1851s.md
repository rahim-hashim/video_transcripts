# Inside the Three Worst Weeks of Trump’s Campaign
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjKj7o0xyaY)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Before we get started, I want to tell you about another show made by the New York Times
*  that pairs perfectly with The Daily.
*  It's called The Headlines.
*  It's a show hosted by my colleague, Tracy Mumford, that quickly catches you up on the
*  day's top stories and features insights from the Times reporters who are covering them,
*  all in about 10 minutes or less.
*  So if you like The Daily, and if you're listening, I have to assume you do, I hope that means
*  you're going to like The Headlines as well.
*  You can now find The Headlines wherever you get your podcasts.
*  So find it, subscribe to it, and thank you.
*  And now, here's today's Daily.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  For much of the past year, Donald Trump and those around him were convinced that victory
*  in the presidential race was all but certain.
*  Now everything has changed.
*  Today my colleague, Jonathan Swan, on Trump's rude awakening and his struggle to adjust.
*  It's Monday, August 12th.
*  Jonathan, welcome back.
*  Thanks for having me back.
*  So the last time we spoke was at the Republican National Convention.
*  Last night, the New York Times bureau there was literally being deconstructed during our
*  interview.
*  And to say that a lot has changed for Donald Trump since that moment feels like an understatement
*  of the highest possible order.
*  When you talk to Trump's aides, the convention in Milwaukee seems like a distant, foggy memory,
*  almost like it never happened.
*  I think back to that first night at the convention when Trump, remember, he'd just been shot
*  two days before.
*  Please welcome the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
*  And he comes into that arena first night, and he's got the big white bandage on his
*  ear.
*  And he's a living martyr.
*  He is here tonight to show his courage, his defiance against somebody who tried to kill
*  him.
*  You will not take this man down.
*  And I just remember that whole week, there was a giddiness and a overconfidence that
*  was just pulsating through the place.
*  Remember, Biden was still the candidate.
*  And there was just a certainty.
*  I don't think I even spoke to a single Republican there who really gave Biden any chance of
*  winning the election.
*  Trump is going to win.
*  If the election was today, he was going to win.
*  If the election was tomorrow, too much from now, he's going to win.
*  And he's going to win in November.
*  He's going to win.
*  The only question, the only suspense, the only mystery was how big is Donald Trump's
*  victory going to be?
*  And then overnight, when Biden drops out, Donald Trump's in a whole new race, the race
*  that him and his team had prepared for, built their whole operation around, spent a year
*  and a half thinking about, planning for, spent tens of millions of dollars on, all of that
*  is gone.
*  Right.
*  So that's really what we want to talk to you about.
*  Trump's behavior, how he has campaigned since everything changed, and what that tells us
*  about how he is adjusting or not adjusting to the realities of this new race.
*  The sense I've gotten from talking to a lot of Trump's advisors and allies is that he
*  was genuinely blindsided by this.
*  I mean, he has been in a foul mood for much of the last three weeks.
*  He has been complaining about the unfairness of what has happened to him.
*  Unfair how?
*  Well, I'll give you an example.
*  So he has been telling people that Democrats are trying to, quote unquote, steal the election
*  from him.
*  And he's comparing it to 2020 and COVID.
*  Wow.
*  What he's saying is he's saying, you know how they changed the voting rules, you know,
*  all these different state legislatures, you know, in the middle of COVID, which is his
*  whole part of his false claim about the election being stolen.
*  Well here he's saying, we had this race won, and then they pulled this bait and switch
*  and they replaced the candidate.
*  So in his mind, Harris replacing Biden, which of course Democrats thought was overdue and
*  necessary, is a kind of pre-stealing of the election.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's bewildering for Trump because the race that he thought he had no longer exists.
*  He's facing someone who's 20 years younger, who doesn't have trouble completing sentences,
*  who actually has energized Democrats, who's drawing big crowds, who's moving up in the
*  polls.
*  And all of these factors are making him extremely frustrated, less than a hundred days out from
*  the election.
*  You can see this projection in his public statements and truth social comments.
*  He's been like, it looked like a sort of this exercise in wishful thinking on truth social,
*  where he's saying, I'm hearing Biden's really angry and wants to get, you know, regrets
*  dropping out and maybe he gets back in, you know, it's sort of like...
*  That's actually the way Trump feels.
*  I know that's what you want, but that's not really what's happening.
*  And so you're seeing this sort of Trump kind of publicly emoting for poor Joe Biden and
*  how mistreated he was.
*  But really, it's just a projection.
*  It's the race Trump wants again.
*  And he can't have it.
*  And he's still sort of pining for that race that no longer exists.
*  Okay.
*  So those are the inward pains and frustrations that you have been picking up on in your reporting.
*  Let's talk about how they are manifesting out in public on the campaign trail.
*  Well coming out of the convention, Trump was constricted, partly by design.
*  The Secret Service were grappling with this huge mistake of allowing him to be almost
*  assassinated.
*  Right.
*  So there's this really big increase in his security.
*  You know, they don't want him doing events outdoors, which he loves doing.
*  He feeds off these open air events.
*  Even his golfing is constricted.
*  So he's feeling cooped up.
*  But there's also just this, I don't know what the right word is, I guess sort of cement
*  footed aspect to his campaign at this point.
*  Suddenly, he's not out there doing much.
*  He's not dominating media.
*  And the person who has seized command of the moment, who is on every television screen,
*  who is the fresh thing that everyone is paying attention to and talking about.
*  Is not him.
*  Yeah.
*  Is his new opponent, Kamala Harris.
*  So we're sort of waiting to see what is the Trump plan to take on Harris.
*  You know, you can see him fumbling around for a nickname for her.
*  You know, he sort of cycles through.
*  First he calls her laughin' Kamala to try and make fun of her laugh.
*  And then according to his advisors, he decides that one doesn't work.
*  So then he goes back to crooked.
*  You know, he used that for Hillary Clinton.
*  He used that for Joe Biden.
*  Then he decides he doesn't really like that.
*  Then he tries out crazy.
*  And then he has this event, which could have actually been a real opportunity for him,
*  which was he decides to go to Chicago on stage for the National Association of Black Journalists
*  Conference.
*  Right.
*  You know, Trump has been trying to eat into Democrats African-American support.
*  So this could have been a moment potentially for him to reset and take control of the race
*  again.
*  And it felt especially bold because he was going to speak to a largely black audience
*  of journalists at precisely the moment that the Democratic Party had decided a black woman
*  would be the party's nominee.
*  So there seemed to be kind of a strategic wisdom to it.
*  Yes.
*  That's what it looked like anyway.
*  But then Trump opened his mouth.
*  Some of your own supporters have labeled Vice President Kamala Harris as a DEI hire.
*  Is that acceptable language to you?
*  Trump gets asked a very sharp question by the ABC reporter, Rachel Scott.
*  How do you define DEI?
*  Diversity, equity, inclusion?
*  Okay, go ahead.
*  Is that what your definition?
*  That is literally the words.
*  Give me a definition then.
*  Would you give me a definition?
*  And Trump takes great offense at the question.
*  So he starts off on this very angry and aggressive footing.
*  Do you believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is only on the ticket because she is
*  a black woman?
*  And then he decides to question whether the first black woman vice president is actually
*  black.
*  She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage.
*  I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black
*  and now she wants to be known as black.
*  So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black?
*  He says absurdly that she only recently decided to embrace her black identity for political
*  purposes when of course her father is Jamaican American.
*  She went to a historically black college.
*  I mean, it's not even really worth engaging with.
*  It's so outlandish.
*  But he basically programs the chyrons on every broadcast news program around the country.
*  That is the story that comes out of this is Donald Trump questioning Kamala Harris's race.
*  His team is desperate to focus on policy attacks, her being this dangerously liberal candidate.
*  But what's the story that comes out of it?
*  It's Donald Trump questioning her race.
*  Right.
*  So even Republicans end up wincing at this thinking like of all the things you could
*  do, why do this?
*  Which makes you sound racist and also just with somebody not having their eye on the
*  ball.
*  Yeah.
*  So he goes off to Georgia for a rally.
*  So just think about this for a second.
*  So Georgia is a state with roughly 30% of the voting electorate is black.
*  Okay.
*  Right.
*  It's a state that Trump needs to win.
*  Their clearest path to victory involves Georgia.
*  So you need to appeal to black voters.
*  What have you done?
*  You've just questioned whether Kamala Harris is actually black.
*  Then you go to Georgia, you go to the rally and Trump decides to bring up again this old
*  feud that he has with Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp.
*  Your governor, Kemp and Raffensperger are doing everything possible to make 2024 difficult
*  for Republicans to win.
*  Brian Kemp is very popular, much more popular than Trump is in Georgia.
*  And Trump attacks Kemp and his wife.
*  But think of the wife.
*  She said two weeks ago, I will not endorse him because he hasn't earned my...
*  I haven't earned her endorsement.
*  I have nothing to do with her.
*  So like, if you were trying to figure out how do I give myself the best chance of losing
*  Georgia, you might question the race of Kamala Harris, attack the popular Republican governor.
*  Oh, and then by the way, just a little bit of a cherry on top to alienate a few more
*  suburban women, attack his wife as well.
*  So when I talk to Trump allies and advisors, many of them view the last three weeks as
*  Trump's worst sustained performance in a very long time.
*  And of course, this is not just any moment in which to have Trump spiral.
*  This is the moment that he most needs to figure out what he's up to because the Democrats
*  have made this extraordinary candidate switch that very much seems to be working while he's
*  just kind of fumbling around and as you're saying, basically shooting himself in both
*  feet.
*  That's right.
*  And Trump takes another shot at the recess.
*  Well, thank you very much.
*  Appreciate your being here.
*  He has a press conference at Mar-a-Lago.
*  Major news outlets are there because his team is doing briefings with reporters.
*  I was there and the press conference goes on for about an hour.
*  And this is not mission accomplished, to say the least.
*  The biggest crowd I've ever spoken, I've spoken to the biggest crowds.
*  He boasts about his crowd size on January 6th.
*  If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you
*  look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people, if not, we had more.
*  Claims falsely that it was bigger than Martin Luther King's crowd when he gave his famous
*  I have a dream speech.
*  Well.
*  So I think the abortion issue has written very much tempered down.
*  And I've answered, I think, very well in the debate.
*  And it seems to be much less of an issue.
*  He equivocated and seemed to be sort of frankly confused when asked about abortion policy.
*  Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother.
*  I believe, you know, I believe strongly.
*  I think that that's a very important thing.
*  I think when you don't, you have to follow your heart.
*  So you know, what was supposed to be a reset after a very tough period actually just extended
*  the very tough period.
*  And you know, there's not much time left.
*  We're in the final 90 days of the campaign.
*  So it's crunch time.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jonathan, how anxious are the people around Donald Trump by the experience of these past
*  two weeks, which they clearly think have been a bit of a mess.
*  And are they convinced that Trump can right this ship and kind of meet the moment of Kamala
*  Harris and her assent?
*  Well, they're in a real race now.
*  And the dynamics have shifted to the extent that Democrats were not excited or motivated
*  to vote for Joe Biden and they are excited and motivated to vote for Kamala Harris.
*  There's a different vibe, as they would say.
*  But in the minds of the Trump campaign, the fundamentals of the race haven't actually
*  changed.
*  Just explain that.
*  Well, yes, there are all of these indicators that are concerning to them.
*  I'm not minimizing that.
*  But they still have a very clear path to victory.
*  And in fact, it's a much clearer path than Kamala Harris has at this moment.
*  They need to win Georgia.
*  Trump has been consistently leading in Georgia.
*  They need to hold on to North Carolina.
*  He has been consistently leading in North Carolina outside the margin of error.
*  And they have to win Pennsylvania, which is closer.
*  So the path is there.
*  There are actually many other paths that he could win, other different combinations of
*  states.
*  So the basic way that the Trump people see it is that Kamala Harris is simply winning
*  back people that Democrats should have had in the first place.
*  And it's not like the mood of the country has changed.
*  It is still a country that is still very, very sour about the economy, anxious about
*  high prices, worried about the border and immigration.
*  These are all issues in which Donald Trump holds huge advantages over Kamala Harris and
*  Democrats.
*  And when you talk to the Trump people, as I do every day, they have a very narrow, as
*  they would say, universe of the electorate that they're focusing on that they call target
*  persuadables.
*  These are voters who they believe are up for grabs.
*  It's about 11% of the electorate.
*  They are disproportionately male, under 50, non-white, independent, moderate actually
*  in ideology.
*  And even though you have an electorate that is overall very sour about the economy, this
*  group is even more sour.
*  These are not people who are following, who are reading newspapers, reading digital news
*  sites, following cable news.
*  They are consuming non-traditional media, you know, streamers, gaming, etc.
*  And that's why you see the Trump campaign doing so much of this non-traditional media
*  to meet these low-information voters where they are.
*  So the Trump team is betting that all of this Harris boom is a honeymoon, it's cotton candy,
*  but they still believe that the fundamental issues that are going to decide this election
*  are issues in which they can not just beat Harris on, but absolutely destroy her on.
*  So in the eyes of the Trump people, just to put this all together, it might look like
*  this race has changed a lot because there's so much energy around Kamala Harris, because
*  there's so much media attention around Kamala Harris.
*  But the fundamentals of the race, the electoral college math, and the reality of who's actually
*  gettable, those haven't changed.
*  And the Trump people are confident that their plan is the more sophisticated one for actually
*  pulling it off.
*  I wouldn't say it hasn't changed.
*  They acknowledge it's a tighter race, but they are betting that hammering those messages
*  in the key states for, and I can't emphasize this enough, a very narrow, small slither
*  of voters that are up for grabs will carry the day.
*  So let's talk about their plan not just to define an issue set that they think will win
*  this election for them, but their plan to define Harris herself.
*  Because so far, as we established in the first half of this conversation, Trump hasn't quite
*  seem to settle on a path or a message for confronting Harris.
*  Well, I think that's an understatement.
*  One of the challenges when you talk to Trump advisors is that they need to narrow their
*  focus.
*  They have so much tape of Kamala Harris saying all sorts of things that are unpopular and
*  very, very liberal and out of step with moderate centrist voters that they actually need to
*  go through a culling exercise and make sure that they're not just throwing everything
*  at the wall.
*  And in the end, nothing will stick.
*  Voters will sort of tune it out.
*  They've done this exhaustive message testing.
*  Top pollster Tony Fabrizio has tested dozens and dozens of messages against Harris to see
*  which ones resonate the most.
*  The ones that they're going to just hammer her again and again and again on are immigration.
*  Joe Biden appointed her to deal with the root causes of migration.
*  They're going to talk about aspects of her record as a prosecutor in San Francisco to
*  portray her as soft on crime.
*  And they're going to tie her to the Biden economy, which while on many indicators is
*  doing well, voters aren't feeling it and aren't saying that.
*  So that's what they're going to focus on.
*  But beyond policy, they're also trying to attack her personally in a few key ways.
*  Like what?
*  So the two that they are doing with her personally is defining her as someone who is not presidential,
*  who's not strong, who is unserious.
*  There's a video they have internally.
*  They call it the word salad video.
*  We've been to the border.
*  You haven't been to the border.
*  And I haven't been to Europe.
*  I mean, I don't understand the point.
*  It's clips of Kamala Harris.
*  You know, she goes on these sort of very unusual verbal excursions.
*  It is time for us to do what we have been doing in that time is every day.
*  Every day it is time.
*  She sort of repeats lines and says things that sound like at times a mangled self-help book.
*  I can imagine what can be and be unburdened by what has been, you know?
*  There's one where she talks about talking about the significance of the passage of time,
*  right?
*  The significance of the passage of time.
*  So when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time.
*  They're trying to paint her as fundamentally unserious, not ready to be commander in chief.
*  Right.
*  They're basically going to start mocking her in compilations of videos that are intended
*  to take the worst possible moments, put them all together and hope that it somehow undermines
*  her credibility.
*  Exactly.
*  The other thing that they're doing that's specific to her is they're trying to portray
*  her as a fraud, as a fake, as someone who reinvents herself for political expedience
*  every few years.
*  And you know, there's a bit of material to work with there.
*  In 2019 when she was running for president, she basically co-signed every hard left position,
*  Whether it be a ban on fracking, abolishing private health insurance, abolishing ICE,
*  giving free healthcare to undocumented immigrants, you know, it's a very long list.
*  She's basically running away from that record now, but they're going to try and portray
*  her as someone who, you know, doesn't actually stand for anything and flip flops.
*  Right.
*  I mean, in a very simple sense, it seems like they're going to try to make this campaign
*  about her now in the same way that for the past two weeks since she became the nominee,
*  she's been trying to make this campaign about Trump.
*  Her stump speech reliably has its loudest applause line when she gets to the idea that
*  she knows Trump's type.
*  And it seems like their plan is to kind of invert that and say, we're now going to tell
*  you what type of person Kamala Harris is.
*  And in their estimation, she's ideologically inconsistent and unserious.
*  Yeah.
*  And one thing that they're desperately trying to do is smoke her out.
*  Their view in the Trump campaign is that Kamala Harris is good in scripted settings.
*  They're very frustrated.
*  She's having these very successful rallies, giving rehearsed stump speech.
*  It's all very well produced and polished, but she has not been giving interviews.
*  She has not been submitting herself to tough questioning.
*  They want to get her into these unscripted settings where they think she's very bad on
*  her feet.
*  I hear that again and again when I talk to Trump advisors, she can't think on her feet.
*  That's what they think.
*  They're trying to force her to take questions from journalists, to bully her into that,
*  to get her on the debate stage where they think that she will wilt under pressure.
*  They want to create new moments that I guess sound a bit like the videos they have in their
*  offices that word salad that will become embarrassing in real time.
*  Exactly.
*  And what do they think those moments will look like?
*  How are they going to smoke her out?
*  Well, he's challenged her to three debates and notably two of them are on networks he
*  hates, ABC and NBC.
*  So that shows you how eager Trump is to get her on that debate stage.
*  And perhaps he of course thinks that what happened to Biden will happen to Harris on
*  a debate stage.
*  In other words, it will be an indelible moment that could change the course of the race.
*  Exactly.
*  The one thing I can't underscore enough is just how much contempt Trump has for Harris.
*  He actually respected Hillary Clinton's intellect.
*  As much as he despised her, he thought she was smart.
*  He does not think Kamala Harris is smart.
*  And in fact, he's been counseled by some advisors to try not to show as much of that contempt
*  publicly.
*  So he does think he's up against someone who is incompetent and is not going to perform
*  well in a debate against him.
*  It could be a big miscalculation, but that's how Trump sees it.
*  And that's how a number of his allies and advisors see it.
*  It feels like the Trump campaign strategy to meet this moment rests on not just the
*  first assumption, which is that Harris, if and when smoked out will falter, but that
*  Trump himself will be capable of being the kind of disciplined candidate who can deliver
*  the policy messages you're talking about on crime, immigration and the economy and not
*  keep doing what he did at NABJ and talking about whether she's actually black or, as
*  you just said, demonstrating open contempt for her intelligence.
*  Those are the biggest X factors.
*  And the biggest one of the two of them is Trump.
*  So far, he has been struggling to adapt to her as a new candidate.
*  It has brought out some of his harshest instincts.
*  And we don't know yet whether he's going to be able to sufficiently control himself
*  not to turn off the voters that he needs to win this election.
*  There was this sort of amazing moment two days after the Association of Black Journalists
*  event.
*  You know, the news cycle has gone crazy about Trump questioning whether she's black.
*  Trump goes to the Hamptons and he's at this very high powered donor dinner.
*  These are some of the wealthiest donors in Republican politics.
*  And one of the donors asks this question that in any normal time, it would have been this
*  completely benign, forgettable question, which was basically what issues should you be talking
*  about?
*  But of course, this was a question that was sort of imbued with great meaning and relevance
*  because he'd just been on this race-basing spree and Trump says, direct quote, I am who
*  I am.
*  Which you know, not exactly reassuring.
*  At the same event, he said that he thought he was right to bring up the question whether
*  she was really black.
*  He said that, you know, we have to stop the steal, you know, relitigating his false claims
*  about the 2020 election, which his advisors are desperate that he would stop talking about.
*  So, you know, this is a 78 year old man who is not changing.
*  So they're going to have to do the best they can with the candidate they've got.
*  Right.
*  I mean, the real risk for Trump is that he sabotages himself, which has always been a
*  risk with Trump, but it's especially a risk, it would seem, in the final weeks of a campaign
*  that he thought he was on a glide path to victory and when it was against Joe Biden.
*  And now, despite everything that's happened, he's basically saying, as a candidate, as
*  a person, I won't change.
*  I don't think I need to change.
*  Exactly.
*  And in fact, if there was ever a moment when Republicans were sort of saying, you know,
*  oh, I think maybe he's a changed man, was after the assassination attempt.
*  He's now saying to people, if anything, I'm more angry.
*  The press wants to say I got nicer after that.
*  No.
*  He's saying that out loud.
*  No.
*  He's not.
*  If that doesn't change you, I'm not sure what does.
*  Right.
*  Apparently not a new rival either.
*  Not so far.
*  Well, Jonathan, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, Trump's political troubles continued.
*  His campaign said it had been the victim of a hacking operation allegedly linked to Iran
*  that resulted in the theft of sensitive internal documents, including research on Trump's
*  running mate, Senator J.D. Vance.
*  Some of those documents have since been shared with major news organizations, including
*  Politico and The Washington Post, in what appears to be an effort to embarrass Trump's
*  campaign.
*  And.
*  No timeouts here.
*  It's Williams.
*  That was a two.
*  Banking in.
*  A two ball.
*  And the United States is going to claim gold for the eighth consecutive Olympics.
*  What a finish.
*  Williams with her foot on the line.
*  On the final day of the 2024 Olympic Summer Games, the U.S. women's basketball team
*  defeated France by a single point, allowing the United States to tie China for the most
*  gold medals, 40 in all.
*  A few hours later.
*  The games ended in Paris with an elaborate closing ceremony, broadcast by NBC from the
*  same stadium where the games began two weeks ago.
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Claire Tennis-Getter, Diana Nguyen and Luke
*  Vanderplug.
