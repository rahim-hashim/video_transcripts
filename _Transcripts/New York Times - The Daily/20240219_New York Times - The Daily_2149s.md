# The Booming Business of Cutting Babiesâ€™ Tongues
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMQ583iwtf0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  A Times investigation has found that doctors are increasingly performing unnecessary medical
*  procedures that generate huge profits while often harming patients.
*  Today, my colleague Katie Thomas on the forces driving this emerging and troubling trend in
*  American healthcare and the story of one family caught in the middle of it.
*  It's Monday, February 19th.
*  So Katie, tell me about this investigation.
*  So I am a healthcare reporter who writes about the kind of intersection of healthcare and
*  money.
*  And I was working with two other colleagues, Sarah Cliff and Jessica Silver Greenberg.
*  And together the three of us had long been interested in are the medical procedures and
*  the tests and other things that we get when we go to the doctor or into a hospital, are
*  they always necessary?
*  But what we were really interested in exploring was not just are these procedures and are
*  these tests, et cetera, are they necessary?
*  But in some situations, could they actually be harmful to patients?
*  And so that's what we decided to try and take a look at.
*  And so we had gotten started in our reporting when we got a tip.
*  And it was from a mom in Boise, Idaho, and her name was Lauren Lavelle.
*  Hi.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Hi.
*  How are you?
*  And my colleague Jessica Silver Greenberg and I went to her house to meet with her.
*  And where does her story start?
*  I am a mom of two.
*  I live in Boise.
*  My daughter June is four and I have a 17 month old Flora.
*  Her story starts when Lauren gets pregnant with her daughter June.
*  So by the time we got pregnant with June, November of 2018, about eight months after
*  we had the miscarriage.
*  I think I was just more hesitant and nervous than anything.
*  Lauren and her husband had had trouble conceiving.
*  And so they were so happy when they learned that they were going to have June.
*  And like most first time parents, they were also a little bit nervous.
*  But being type A and super prepared, I did all my homework.
*  We hired a doula.
*  I wanted an epidural.
*  Having an actual childbirth absolutely was not for me.
*  And Lauren is very organized.
*  She's always on top of everything and she makes all sorts of plans and she gets a lot
*  of different providers lined up ahead of time.
*  I didn't know anything about breastfeeding, like zero things.
*  Including one that she has hired to help her with breastfeeding.
*  Where did you find out about her?
*  So I asked our doula for a list of recommendations and she gave me a very short list.
*  At the time there were very few lactation consultants in the valley and Melanie was
*  one of them.
*  We ended up deciding to work with Melanie Henstrom, who is a local lactation consultant
*  in Boise.
*  She sold this package at the time.
*  I don't know if she still did, but it was like prenatal visit, breastfeeding class.
*  And then she'll come to the hospital and help you latch and then she'll come to the house
*  a couple times after.
*  And I thought, well, that sounds perfect.
*  Great.
*  You know, I'm covered there.
*  So one week after her due date, she gives birth and it was a difficult labor.
*  It took 24 hours.
*  Lauren was completely exhausted.
*  Once June arrived, the family was very, very excited to have her.
*  And I remember June coming out and that surreal feeling you have when you see your first baby
*  for the first time.
*  Like, oh my God, like there's a baby in the room.
*  And June was a healthy baby, but she was having trouble breastfeeding.
*  She would not latch.
*  Like she wouldn't even attempt.
*  She would scream.
*  It was the only time she ever cried, if you tried to make her breastfeed.
*  So as her pediatrician was making the rounds, they noticed that June was having trouble
*  and said that June's tongue is really tight.
*  We can clip it if you like.
*  And that they could clip it.
*  What does that mean exactly, Katie clipping her tongue?
*  What it means is that there's a small percentage of babies whose tongue is very tightly tethered
*  to the bottom of their mouth.
*  And for a very small percentage of babies, their tongue is almost tied so tightly down
*  that they can't nurse well.
*  So it makes breastfeeding very difficult if a baby has a tongue like this.
*  Exactly.
*  If you bottle feed your baby, the baby can basically adjust and make do.
*  But if you want to breastfeed, some babies have trouble basically latching on to their
*  mother when they don't have that tongue motion.
*  And so some version of clipping these tongue ties has been done for centuries.
*  Midwives have been doing it.
*  Pediatricians do it.
*  Traditionally what it's been is a very quick snip right underneath the tongue just to loosen
*  up the tongue.
*  And traditionally that procedure is extremely straightforward.
*  There's little to no follow-up care.
*  And basically the baby naturally heals as it learns to breastfeed.
*  And so we said, okay, you know, they explained that it was completely painless.
*  They do it with scissors.
*  She wouldn't even feel it.
*  And all of that was true.
*  They clipped it.
*  I don't even think she woke up.
*  But in June's case, it didn't seem to help much.
*  She and Lauren were still having problems breastfeeding afterwards.
*  So while she's still in the hospital, she calls up the lactation consultant that she
*  had hired, Melanie Henstrom, just to let her know what was going on.
*  And from talking to her on the phone, Melanie said that the situation was actually much
*  worse than Lauren had thought and that Lauren's baby needed another tongue tie procedure,
*  a deeper cut under the tongue.
*  How did she make this diagnosis, Katie?
*  Was it over the phone?
*  How did she know this?
*  Yes.
*  Lauren told us that it was from a phone conversation.
*  And in addition to that, she also warned her that basically, you know, Lauren and her husband
*  should really take this seriously and consider getting it done because if she doesn't get
*  it fixed, it could lead to a whole host of problems beyond just problems breastfeeding.
*  She'll have scoliosis and she'll suffer from migraines and she'll never eat and she'll
*  have a speech impediment and she won't sleep.
*  I mean, just like the long list of things over the phone.
*  And Lauren starts panicking.
*  I mean, first of all, I've never felt more terrible in my life than that first day or
*  so after giving birth, like the come down from the hormones, the drugs, all of it, the
*  sleep deprivation.
*  And then, you know, here was this baby we'd wanted, we were told we probably would never
*  have after one miscarriage.
*  And she's so perfect, like the most beautiful baby I've ever seen.
*  And you think that she has some deformity that's going to ruin her.
*  But Melanie says it's okay.
*  She has a solution.
*  And she tells Lauren that there's a dentist in town who can handle cases that are as severe
*  as June's.
*  A dentist?
*  Why a dentist?
*  Well, there's a procedure that's done in a dentist's office that's a laser surgery.
*  And dentists use this high powered laser machine that can quickly cut the flesh that connects
*  the lips and the cheeks to the gums.
*  So according to Lauren, Melanie tells her that by chance, this dentist has an opening
*  because she said a family coming in from Oregon had just canceled their Saturday appointment.
*  So I thought, okay, wow, you know, people are coming in from Oregon to see him.
*  So we talked about it.
*  We both felt unsure.
*  But we said, well, let's at least take the appointment and then we can at least meet
*  with the dentist and also someone can look at our mouth and assess.
*  So Lauren agrees to go in and meet the dentist.
*  Like I think some people, when they hear this story, think like, why would you believe that?
*  Like it just sounds so scammy.
*  But to me, there's a lot of things that you hear in the hospital that sound insane.
*  Like it's no different than someone saying like your baby's orange because their Billy
*  Rubens little levers are too high.
*  So we got to go put them under these lights.
*  Like that sounds insane.
*  That sounds more insane than, you know, your baby's having a hard time eating because their
*  tongue is too tight and it needs to be cut.
*  Like that seems rational, actually.
*  And all of this seemed really weird to Lauren at the time.
*  But you know, in the context of the hospital and having a baby, lots of things about health
*  care are weird.
*  Right.
*  So one day after they got back home from the hospital, Lauren and her husband pack up the
*  car and go to the office early in the morning.
*  You know, I was wearing my hospital diaper and an ice pack, took the elevator up to his
*  office.
*  And what happens?
*  So Melanie greets them at the door.
*  They sign some paperwork and pretty soon the dentist, Dr. Samuel Zink arrives.
*  And then he like very briefly, you know, very briefly looks in her mouth and is like, yeah,
*  she's got, you know, whatever, however he classified it, grade four, whatever he says,
*  class four.
*  And she has a lip tie, which, you know, that had never been mentioned to us before.
*  So it's very much like on the spot, like this new piece of information.
*  You know, pretty quickly the dentist diagnosed June as having a couple of ties.
*  He confirmed that she had a tongue tie and he said it was severe.
*  He also said that she had tightness under her top lip called a lip tie.
*  And so the baby actually needed to get two cuts.
*  And again, Lauren said that the dentist and the consultant told her how important it was
*  for her to do this for her baby.
*  One of us says like, you know, what happens if we don't do the procedure?
*  Like what are our alternatives?
*  And it was like basically like, there's no alternative.
*  Like you have to do this otherwise, like again, long, long.
*  So Lauren and her husband decided to do it.
*  But before the procedure starts, Melanie actually stopped Lauren from coming into the room.
*  Melanie turned around and put a hand on my shoulder and said, oh, no.
*  And I said, oh, am I not going with you?
*  She goes, well, we can't tell you no.
*  But you know, if you hear her cry, it'll impact your milk supply, like adversely.
*  What do I know?
*  So I said, oh, OK.
*  And she pulled out the white noise machine and said, what do you want to listen to?
*  And I had no idea what she was talking about.
*  I had no idea what it was.
*  And so then she just turned it on, white noise and left.
*  What happens next is Melanie turns on a white noise machine in the room.
*  And that was the moment that I was like, get your baby and get out of here.
*  And I didn't listen to it.
*  It was like all of my mom intuition firing, being like, this isn't right.
*  You know, it's like, I don't know how to describe it, but like a full body, you have
*  to get your baby and get out of here.
*  And I just ignored it.
*  She said her maternal instincts really kicked in and she just had this instinctive fear
*  about the procedure and whether June would be OK.
*  But the procedure itself was very quick.
*  Within just a couple of minutes, Melanie returns with June.
*  And she was screaming, like screaming.
*  And so worked up.
*  This was like hysterical and consolable.
*  And she was also choking on something like gagging.
*  And June was so worked up.
*  Lauren had only had her for a couple of days, but she said that this was on a different
*  level than any other way she had ever seen June crying.
*  And June just wouldn't stop crying.
*  And she looked over to Melanie and Lauren said that she remembered Melanie saying this
*  was very typical.
*  And so they pay the dentist, they pay $600 for the procedure, and then they go home.
*  And what happens over the next several days?
*  June did not get better, you know, as Melanie had assured them.
*  You know, she was basically inconsolable, Lauren said, just crying hysterically.
*  And Lauren and her husband, you know, they don't know how to comfort her.
*  They're new parents.
*  They've only had a baby a couple of days.
*  And you know, they're almost beside themselves.
*  There was nothing we could do.
*  And I remember finally, I said like, this is not normal.
*  We're going to the emergency room.
*  And they decided to go to the emergency room, where a doctor looks inside June's mouth and
*  finds a large sore in her mouth that he says is probably causing her so much pain.
*  And so he said, you know, it breaks my heart to see a sore that big and a baby this small.
*  It was like, the floodgates opened and like, there was nothing but guilt and shame, like
*  unmanageable guilt and shame.
*  Like what have we done?
*  Who are these people?
*  What have I done to my baby?
*  Will she ever be the same?
*  Like, what did I do?
*  So at this point, Lauren is really understanding that her intuition about this surgery was
*  probably right and that she and her husband may have really made a mistake with this.
*  What does June's recovery look like?
*  So June never did end up breastfeeding successfully, which was the main reason why Lauren and her
*  husband had decided to do this procedure.
*  That was the whole point, right?
*  That was the whole point, right.
*  And over the next couple of years, June had a number of issues that, you know, there's
*  no official medical diagnosis for, but Lauren has attributed a lot of her behaviors to what
*  had happened to her when she was just a few days old.
*  I mean, you couldn't close the fridge door too loud or else it would like set her off.
*  Or, you know, we would attempt to take her for a stroller walk on the green belt, which
*  is the walking path.
*  And she'd be asleep in her car seat, you know, stroller and someone would try to pass this
*  on their bike and like ring their bell and it would start a whole and it would just like
*  set her off.
*  So she just was very, very, very fragile.
*  So Lauren just wanted to get answers and she really wanted to hold Melanie and the dentist
*  accountable.
*  So she gathered all of the paperwork that she had, texts, emails, other correspondence,
*  and she went to the Idaho Board of Dentistry where she filed a complaint against the dentist.
*  And then she also went to a professional organization that certifies lactation consultants and filed
*  a complaint with them as well.
*  And did she get anywhere with either of them?
*  At first, no.
*  The Idaho Dentistry Board didn't want to investigate and Lauren appealed and she lost her appeal.
*  And she didn't initially hear back at all from the lactation board.
*  No one wanted to take responsibility.
*  That's the thing.
*  No one wanted to stick their neck out there.
*  What's the alternative?
*  The story never gets told?
*  And that's when she decided to reach out to us.
*  And after our story came out, the lactation board finally told Lauren that they were investigating Melanie.
*  And Katie, you guys were reporting the story.
*  I'm assuming you reached out to both the dentist and to Melanie.
*  What did they say?
*  Beyond a very brief phone conversation that I had with Melanie in which she defended her
*  work and she said that she had a number of very satisfied customers.
*  She didn't respond to detailed questions about Lauren's story or the stories of her former
*  clients.
*  And Dr. Zink did not respond to our request for comment.
*  But he did tell the dentistry board that Lauren's baby's procedure was uneventful and that an
*  extremely small percentage of patients do not respond well to the procedure.
*  And how big of an issue is this, Katie?
*  I mean, how common is it for mothers to have an experience like Lauren's?
*  So after we got the tip from Lauren and we dug deeper into her story, we found ourselves
*  really surprised by how big this industry was for tongue tie releases.
*  And in part, it's been driven by this movement for breastfeeding and the breast is best campaign
*  and a growing number of parents who are choosing to breastfeed their children.
*  In turn, that has sparked this big boom in tongue tie releases.
*  One study that we found showed that these procedures have grown 800% in recent years.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And also, as we started talking to other parents around the country, we learned that some of
*  them had similar stories to what Lauren had told us.
*  There's plenty of instances where there's no harm done to the baby at all when they
*  get these procedures.
*  We also found cases where babies were harmed, where they developed oral aversions, which
*  basically means that they don't want to eat because they fear having anything put in their
*  mouth, including a bottle.
*  We found cases where babies became malnourished, had to be hospitalized.
*  We found more than one instance in which babies had to be given a feeding tube just weeks
*  after the procedure.
*  So these sounds so painful and awful for a newborn, these problems, but I guess there's
*  always a risk, Katie, in any medical procedure, right?
*  How much of this is just the risk you sign up for when you agree that your baby should
*  have a surgery?
*  Well, that's true.
*  There's always a risk, but what you're supposed to do is weigh the risks against what the
*  potential benefits of a procedure are.
*  When we really started drilling down into what those benefits were and into the medical
*  research, we found there just wasn't a lot of potential benefit for these procedures,
*  you know, if at all in many cases.
*  Really?
*  So the procedures don't have a medical reason to exist?
*  That's right.
*  We reviewed all of the best quality medical research on this, and you know, other than
*  that old fashioned snip under the tongue, which does show that in some cases it can
*  reduce pain for breastfeeding mothers.
*  But otherwise, all of this growth and all of these other more invasive procedures, we
*  found there just wasn't good evidence that they helped babies.
*  And the more we looked into tongue ties and started to connect it to the other reporting
*  we were doing, we started to realize that it was driven by some really big forces in
*  our health care system that really had the potential to harm patients.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Katie, we talked about this new surge in a procedure that surgically unties infants
*  tongues from the bottom of their mouths, often needlessly, sometimes even harmfully.
*  And you said your reporting found that this surgery was actually part of a broader trend.
*  Tell me about this trend and what's driving it.
*  So that's what this investigation was really about, to find the procedures that are doing
*  unnecessary harm to patients and to really kind of understand why this is happening.
*  You know, like what's driving the prevalence of these procedures.
*  And you know, there's just a lot of unnecessary surgeries out there.
*  We decided to center our reporting on three particular surgeries that had the potential
*  to harm patients in addition to tongue ties.
*  We focused on a particular hernia surgery, a bariatric surgery, which can be overdone
*  and cause harm, and a vascular surgery done on patients' legs to help us understand the
*  forces that were at work that were driving all of this.
*  And what did you find when you dug deeper into those surgeries?
*  Well, it's very complex, but we ultimately found three main drivers that were underlying
*  all of these.
*  First, there's a financial incentive for the doctors to perform these surgeries.
*  There's also a real push from the medical device companies that make these surgeries
*  possible.
*  And last, there's a huge information void for solid medical advice that a lot of these
*  doctors and companies take advantage of in order to push the surgeries.
*  OK, so let's start with the money, Katie.
*  How exactly is that incentivizing doctors to perform a lot more of these procedures?
*  Like, what are the mechanics of that?
*  So the reality of our health care industry today is that in many places, even in places
*  like nonprofit hospitals, the doctors who work there are not getting a salary, a straight
*  salary that's just kind of you get paid for showing up to work that day.
*  Instead, they're actually getting paid based on the procedures that they're doing, how
*  complex those procedures are, possibly how lucrative.
*  And it's not every doctor.
*  There are still doctors that get paid salaries.
*  But it's increasingly the case that doctors have at least a part of their pay is tied
*  to the procedures that they're doing.
*  Interesting. So the procedure is growing in importance in terms of actual compensation
*  for doctors.
*  Right.
*  I mean, in part, it's kind of baked into the health care system that we've always had.
*  You can even think about it as the small town doctor who operated his own independent practice
*  or her own independent practice.
*  It's essentially a small business, and they would get paid based on the patients that
*  they saw it.
*  But like increasingly, even in, for example, large hospital systems where you might think
*  that a doctor is just getting paid a salary to work in a hospital.
*  In fact, a chunk of their bonus, for example, can sometimes be tied to the procedures that
*  they're doing.
*  And that is increasingly the case.
*  Interesting.
*  And so one particularly egregious example of this was at a hospital that's in New York,
*  Bellevue Hospital.
*  And basically what my colleagues found there was that they had basically turned their surgery
*  department into an assembly line for bariatric surgery, which makes your stomach smaller
*  and can lead to weight loss.
*  But what we found was that they were green lighting patients that basically didn't meet
*  the qualifications for the surgery, which is a serious surgery.
*  And what they found was that there were several situations where people had very serious outcomes
*  as a result of getting the bariatric surgery there.
*  Okay.
*  So this is an extreme case of a hospital turning to a particular surgery to drive profits.
*  And it wasn't uncommon in your reporting, it sounds like.
*  No, it wasn't the only example, but it was the most striking.
*  And when we reached out to Bellevue, they defended their work and they said that their
*  practices were helping patients who wouldn't otherwise get care.
*  But our reporting was pretty conclusive that the program was turning through a record number
*  of surgeries.
*  So what else was driving this increase in harmful surgeries that you guys found?
*  So we found it wasn't just the hospitals who were benefiting.
*  The other major player that benefits are these companies that are making the tools and the
*  products that doctors are using during the procedures.
*  And in order for them to sell more of their products, a lot of time what they end up doing
*  is promoting the procedures themselves.
*  So like medical device makers, like the company that made the laser in June surgery.
*  Right.
*  And, you know, they do this in a number of ways.
*  They're giving them loans to help them buy the equipment.
*  And in some cases, they're even lending them money to help set up those clinics where the
*  procedures are performed.
*  So they're really underwriting these doctors so that they can perform more surgeries and
*  ultimately sell more machines.
*  Yes.
*  And the other things that they do is, you know, the laser companies, for example, they
*  will host webinars where they will have dentists who frequently perform these procedures show
*  other dentists how to do the procedures.
*  We even discovered this conference that was created by one of the laser companies, and
*  it had kind of a wild name.
*  The name of the conference was tongue ties and tequilas.
*  Oh, God.
*  Right.
*  It brought in dentists to talk about how to make money off the procedures, you know, how
*  to promote themselves on social media, how to actually perform the procedure.
*  And you know, of course, when they were all done, they got to celebrate with an open tequila
*  bar.
*  Okay, so a lot of this really amounts to these companies trying to popularize these procedures,
*  basically, like to get the word out, even if the procedures don't really work or in
*  some cases cause harm.
*  Right.
*  But they also play a big role in the other factor that's driving a lot of this, which
*  is the information that they put out there about the surgeries.
*  These companies often sponsor research, which doctors often rely on to guide their practices.
*  And you know, part of what we found is that it can kind of create this echo chamber where
*  doctors feel more comfortable and justified in doing these procedures when they have kind
*  of this whole alternate universe that is telling them that it's okay to do these procedures.
*  And in fact, it's beneficial to patients.
*  So tell me about this echo chamber effect.
*  The best example of this we found was a doctor in Michigan named Dr. Jihad Mustafa.
*  He calls himself the leg saver.
*  And what we found was that he and several other doctors do these procedures called atheroctomies,
*  which is basically like inserting a tiny roto-router inside an artery to get the blood flowing.
*  Dr. Mustafa in particular was not only a very prolific performer of these procedures, but
*  he actually founded his own medical conference and even helped start a medical journal that
*  was devoted to using these procedures.
*  You know, like tongue ties, there's really no good evidence that these are actually beneficial
*  to patients.
*  And in fact, despite his nickname as the leg saver, one insurance company told Michigan
*  authorities that 45 people had lost their limbs after getting treated at Dr. Mustafa's
*  clinic over a four-year period.
*  Forty-five people lost their limbs?
*  Yes.
*  I mean, that is the ultimate version of harm, right?
*  Right.
*  Now, he did speak to us and he defended his work and said that he treats very sick people.
*  And despite his best efforts, some of these patients are already so sick that they sometimes
*  lose their limbs.
*  And how much did he receive for each procedure?
*  Doctors like him typically receive about $13,000 for each of these atheroctomy procedures.
*  Wow.
*  We found that that misinformation or poor information also applied when doctors were
*  learning new types of surgeries.
*  Really?
*  Like how?
*  So one of the areas we looked at was the area of hernia surgery that I mentioned.
*  And there's a particular type of surgery.
*  It's a very complex version of a hernia surgery called component separation.
*  And the expert surgeons that we spoke to said that it's difficult to learn and you have
*  to practice it over and over and over again to get it right.
*  But one recent survey of hernia surgeons said that one out of the four surgeons had taught
*  themselves how to perform that operation.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Not by learning it from an experienced surgeon, but by watching videos on Facebook and YouTube.
*  I mean, how unusual is that?
*  I guess to me it strikes me as very unusual.
*  I mean, I think of learning about how to take my kitchen faucet apart on YouTube, but I
*  do not think of a doctor learning about how to perform a surgery on YouTube.
*  Right.
*  And it has actually become increasingly popular in recent years and there's not good vetting
*  of the quality of the instruction.
*  We even found videos on a website run by a medical device company that was intended to
*  be a how-to for how to do these surgeries, but the video contained serious mistakes.
*  Wow.
*  And Katie, all of these videos, some of them with serious mistakes, I mean, is this something
*  that would be subject to medical regulators?
*  Like, is there any kind of rules of the road for this stuff?
*  You know, there's less than you would expect.
*  Sometimes hospitals have rules about what sort of education their doctors need before
*  performing a surgery, but we were surprised that there was a lot less regulation than
*  we thought there would be and much less vetting of these videos than we anticipated.
*  So essentially what you found was this complex, oftentimes interconnected group of forces,
*  device companies pushing their products, hospitals bolstering their bottom line, and rampant
*  misinformation that, as you said, all really trace back to the same motivating factor,
*  which is money.
*  But wouldn't the fear of being sued for medical malpractice prevent a lot of this behavior?
*  You know, this kept popping up during the course of our reporting.
*  I do think we have this idea that any time a doctor does anything wrong, they're going
*  to get sued.
*  But that just wasn't always the case in our reporting.
*  You know, there's a lot of statutes of limitations, time limits on when somebody can file a lawsuit,
*  in other ways that make it somewhat hard to really hold a doctor accountable.
*  One example is the regulatory organizations that oversee doctors.
*  The one doctor that I mentioned earlier, Dr. Mustafa, state investigators had found that
*  his overuse of procedures had led people to lose their legs.
*  And yet he ultimately settled with the state and he was fined $25,000.
*  That actually adds up to about two of these atherectomy procedures.
*  So it sounds like malpractice is not necessarily going to be the route to rectifying a lot
*  of this.
*  But I guess I'm wondering if the federal government could actually rein some of this in, you know,
*  before the patients are harmed.
*  You know, it's possible, but this is just a very difficult issue.
*  Some of the themes that we explored in this reporting are really just firmly embedded
*  in our healthcare system in the way that it works.
*  The fact is that we have a for-profit healthcare system, right?
*  So everyone from doctors to hospitals to the device companies benefit when more procedures
*  are done.
*  All of the incentives are pointing in the same direction.
*  And so trying to find one or two simple solutions will probably not easily fix the issue as
*  much as we all hope that it could.
*  So is the lesson here be much more discriminating and vigilant as a patient?
*  I mean, to get a second opinion when you're standing in front of a doctor or a dentist
*  who's telling you that you or your baby needs a procedure?
*  Yes, I think that is one of the takeaways.
*  But look, we understood that even reporting on all of this was risky, because people could
*  hear about these harmful surgeries and start wondering if everything that their doctors
*  tell them is a scam.
*  And of course, while some of these procedures are harmful, a lot of procedures are lifesaving.
*  But ultimately, for now, patients are kind of left on their own to navigate what's a
*  pretty complex and opaque healthcare system.
*  When you have somebody standing in front of you saying, you should do this, it can be
*  very confusing, right?
*  And this is something that Lauren talked a lot about, just how confusing all of this
*  was for her.
*  There's a lot of information that you're getting that is truly like someone is speaking
*  a foreign language.
*  And because they do it all day long, it's not user friendly.
*  It isn't designed for the comfort or understanding of the person receiving the information.
*  There is so much blind trust and faith that you have in the system, in the providers who
*  are giving this information.
*  You trust this is what they do all day long.
*  So there is no real reason to question that is the system that we have in this country.
*  Katie, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Friday, the Russian authorities announced that opposition leader Alexei Navalny died
*  in prison.
*  He was 47.
*  Navalny, a charismatic anti-corruption activist, led the opposition to Vladimir Putin for more
*  than a decade.
*  His popularity was broad, extending far outside the realm of liberal Moscow.
*  And that proved threatening to the Russian authorities who attempted to poison him in
*  2020.
*  Navalny survived and later extracted a confession from his would-be assassin on tape.
*  Navalny believed that Russia could be a free society.
*  And he had the extraordinary ability, through sheer force of his personality, charisma and
*  confidence to get others to believe it too.
*  Though he had been in prison since 2021, his death still came as a shock.
*  His wife, Yulia Navalny, made a surprise appearance at a security conference in Munich shortly
*  after the Russian authorities announced her husband's death.
*  She received an emotional standing ovation.
*  In Moscow, my colleague Valerie Hopkins spoke to Russians who were placing flowers in his
*  honor.
*  And expressing disbelief that he was gone.
*  And I asked them if they believe in the beautiful Russia of the future that Navalny talked about.
*  And they said yes, but we don't think we will survive to see it.
*  At least 400 people have been detained since his death, including a priest who had been
*  scheduled to hold a memorial service in St. Petersburg.
*  Today's episode was produced by Ashta Chaturvedi, Diana Nguyen, Will Reed and Alex Stern, with
*  help from Michael Simon Johnson.
*  It was edited by Michael Benoit, with help from Brendan Klinkenberg, contains original
*  music by Diane Wong and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderland.
*  That's it for the daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tarnisi.
*  See you tomorrow.
