# There’s No Escaping Wildfire Smoke
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA)
*  This is Daily Producer Alex Stern. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm in the Brewery Town neighborhood of Philadelphia. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  This is Sydney Hopper. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  I'm in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=8.52s)]
*  This is Claire Tennesgetter out in Brooklyn. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=10.74s)]
*  And this is the third day of air quality warnings in New York City. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=13.32s)]
*  So I'm going to talk to people who are outside today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=17.52s)]
*  Can I ask you about the air? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=19.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=22.72s)]
*  First I noticed it when I was looking up at the sun, it was pretty much orange and stuff [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=23.72s)]
*  like that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=27.76s)]
*  And then I smelled like it was a burning snow. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=28.76s)]
*  Last time I smelled something like that when I was in Afghanistan. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=31.12s)]
*  So it's just from a reminder. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  I was smelling some plastics and some like other weird toxins and I don't know. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Something was in that air that wasn't agreeing with my nose. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=44.6s)]
*  I got a big nose as you can see. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=47.28s)]
*  I can smell anything and everything. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=49.32s)]
*  But I had to run back in the house. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  That's the case. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=53.88s)]
*  I had to get a mask, my inhaler and everything. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=54.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=58.0s)]
*  Why are you wearing a mask? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=59.0s)]
*  Because I got your air. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=62.0s)]
*  I've been sneezing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=65.0s)]
*  No, stop. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=67.0s)]
*  I like to keep sneezing a lot. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=68.0s)]
*  It does feel different. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=70.84s)]
*  I do have a headache. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=72.04s)]
*  I feel a little bit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=73.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=74.04s)]
*  I just want to go home. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=75.04s)]
*  I can feel it in my eyes. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=82.04s)]
*  I can feel it in my throat. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=84.16s)]
*  I feel it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=86.36s)]
*  It's inside my house. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=87.36s)]
*  We've had the windows closed, but it's inside my house. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=88.36s)]
*  And it's sort of like, is this what our future is going to be like? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=91.36s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=101.36s)]
*  Over the past few days, wildfires in Canada have created a crisis in the American Northeast, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  where air pollution in New York reached its worst level in modern history. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=112.6s)]
*  Today, climate columnist David Wallace Wells explains why it happened, why it's likely [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=117.6s)]
*  to keep happening, and why there's so little we can do to stop it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=124.72s)]
*  It's Friday, June 9th. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=130.6s)]
*  David, welcome to the show. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=133.6s)]
*  Thanks for it to be here. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=139.6s)]
*  So David, I'm in Washington, D.C., and I walked my dog this morning. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=141.84s)]
*  And the air had this very bitter burning smell. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=144.84s)]
*  Even my dog was noticing it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=149.84s)]
*  She kept kind of looking back up at me like, are we still walking? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=151.84s)]
*  What is this? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=154.84s)]
*  Now it's lunchtime. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=155.84s)]
*  I just looked at my phone and scrolled for the AQI measure, which now of course we all [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=157.84s)]
*  know what that means, air quality index. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=162.84s)]
*  And the reading is 175, which my phone tells me is pretty unhealthy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=164.84s)]
*  You're in New York. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=171.08s)]
*  What did it look like out of your window this morning? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=172.08s)]
*  Things are gray. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=175.08s)]
*  They're not orange. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=177.08s)]
*  Yesterday, they were orange. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=178.08s)]
*  The AQI is, I think, about the same level as you're seeing in D.C. now, which is in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=179.08s)]
*  the high 100s. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=184.08s)]
*  But yesterday, it peaked well above 400. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=185.08s)]
*  Over 400? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=187.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=188.68s)]
*  And this is a level of pollution that is the worst wildfire exposure in recorded recent [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=189.68s)]
*  history going back at least several decades in the U.S. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=195.52s)]
*  And this is not just unprecedented for a place like New York, which has felt very distant [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  from the threat of wildfire in recent years, but it's really close to unprecedented globally. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  This is not what the most polluted places in the world are dealing with on a regular [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=207.28s)]
*  basis. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  It is a dramatic, historic spike, and people have become principally preoccupied with it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  in a way that has reminded a lot of people I know of the first days of COVID in 2020. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=219.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  Can you just explain simply why is there so much smoke and where's it coming from? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=224.8s)]
*  The basic story is that Canada is on fire. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  And when I say that, it's not much of an exaggeration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=237.16000000000003s)]
*  There are out-of-control fires, hundreds of them, all the way from the west coast of Canada, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=239.8s)]
*  stretching all the way to the east. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  This is really unusual for this time of year. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=248.32000000000002s)]
*  The last time I checked, the country as a whole had registered 14 times as much burning [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=251.0s)]
*  this year as has been typical in the last decade for Canada. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=256.68s)]
*  14 times. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=260.12s)]
*  And it's compared to the last decade, which was itself an off-the-charts period for Canadian [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=261.36s)]
*  wildfire because as is happening almost everywhere in the world, fires are getting more intense, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=265.76s)]
*  more dramatic, in part because of the influence of climate change. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=270.8s)]
*  And so we're saying even from that totally bonkers baseline of the last decade, this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=273.92s)]
*  year we are 14 times higher. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=278.18s)]
*  Now that's not to say that by the end of the year we're going to end up with a fire season [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=282.0s)]
*  that's been 14 times as bad in Canada as in previous years. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=286.2s)]
*  It could plateau, it could slow down. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=288.6s)]
*  But for this time of year, from May into June, we are dealing with something that is completely [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=291.16s)]
*  unprecedented and the Canadian fire services are totally overwhelmed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=295.94s)]
*  They're calling in international support and they're openly saying that something like [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=301.8s)]
*  the majority of the fires that are burning right now are out of control and indeed beyond [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=305.92s)]
*  their capacity to control. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=310.04s)]
*  And what does this mean about how long this is going to stick around? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=315.68s)]
*  I mean, this horrible air. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=319.44s)]
*  Well, the fires themselves are going to be burning for quite a while, probably months. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=321.0s)]
*  What determines where the smoke goes, though, are wind patterns that are a little bit more [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=325.48s)]
*  fickle. In this case, we have wind that's pushing the smoke directly south, basically [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=329.32000000000005s)]
*  right into the path of New York City. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=334.0s)]
*  That's a bit of an unusual wind pattern. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  Probably it will change quickly if it hasn't already. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=337.48s)]
*  But we can't really see all that far into the future, which means we don't know precisely [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=340.84s)]
*  where the smoke will be carried, say, a week or two weeks from now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=344.96s)]
*  In the medium term, I don't expect that New York is going to return entirely to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=347.76s)]
*  clear skies like we had a few weeks ago. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=352.92s)]
*  Any time soon, there's probably going to be some ongoing impact for not just New Yorkers, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=355.28s)]
*  but people really all around the eastern US. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=360.24s)]
*  So, David, presumably they've had wildfires in the past in Canada and the smoke hasn't [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=363.6s)]
*  turned our sky orange. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=368.16s)]
*  Why now? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, the world is becoming more fire prone because of climate change, which is warming [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=371.32s)]
*  things, baking things, drying things out and making them more like ready tinder. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=375.68s)]
*  And one thing that means is that the character of the fires themselves are changing once [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=380.64s)]
*  they burn. They're able to grow faster and larger. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  They burn at higher temperatures. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=389.04s)]
*  I had some folks from Cal Fire a couple of years ago tell me they now burn so hot that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  they can turn the silica in the soil into glass. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=394.88s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=397.92s)]
*  They can also burn a lot of other material, pieces of metal, pieces of plastic, pieces [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=398.68s)]
*  of rubber. And in part, as a result of the intensity of these fires and the extra heat, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=403.32000000000005s)]
*  you end up drawing a lot more of the burned material higher up into the atmosphere. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=408.12s)]
*  It's an effect of just how hot and how intense the fires are, which allows winds to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  carry it farther afield. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=416.56s)]
*  And we know that's going to be happening more and more often, in part because we're [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  actually seeing that already play out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=421.72s)]
*  Just a few years ago, the Australia bushfires of 2019, 2020, which is often called the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  Black Summer fires in Australia, was an absolutely off the charts wildfire season. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=432.24s)]
*  Millions of acres burned. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=437.52s)]
*  Billions of animals died. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  They had to rescue Australians off the beach. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=440.68s)]
*  You know, people were floating in the water, hanging off piers to escape the fire that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=443.52s)]
*  was right on the shore, waiting for a boat or a helicopter to pick them up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=447.48s)]
*  And even in Sydney, the smoke was so thick that ferries in the harbor had to cancel [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  their service because they couldn't navigate the harbor. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=457.40000000000003s)]
*  They couldn't see. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=459.12s)]
*  But the global drift of the Australian smoke is really remarkable to contemplate. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=465.6s)]
*  It doesn't just blanket Australia in toxic smoke. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  That smoke travels eastward with the wind. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  And when it gets to New Zealand, it's still so thick that Auckland is dealing with the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  same visual effects and air quality issues that New York has been dealing with the last [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=482.12s)]
*  few days. It is also totally eerie and amber. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=485.88s)]
*  But the smoke didn't stop there either. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=488.92s)]
*  It kept going. It kept went out across the Pacific and traveled all the way across the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=490.48s)]
*  enormous South Pacific, all the way to South America. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=495.44s)]
*  And it didn't stop there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=498.64s)]
*  It traveled across the continent and it didn't stop there. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=499.6s)]
*  It ended up going across the Atlantic as well. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  We're seeing smoke like this, smoke events like these, especially from these truly off [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=504.48s)]
*  the charts fires, traveling farther and farther and reaching into more and more places, more [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=508.6s)]
*  and more, ultimately more and more lungs. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  So, David, looking at all of this together, we're seeing hotter fires with smoke that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  travels farther. And this means that there's bad air in more and more places, including [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=529.24s)]
*  in places that we haven't seen before. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=534.2800000000001s)]
*  There's a pattern here, it looks like. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=536.44s)]
*  Is this the new normal? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=538.88s)]
*  Well, I don't think that we're going to be seeing many days like we saw in New York this [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=540.2800000000001s)]
*  week, all that frequently going forward. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  They're so off the charts. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=546.44s)]
*  Wednesday's air quality in New York City was by far the worst that had ever been recorded. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  And I don't think we're going to be living on that baseline going forward. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=553.24s)]
*  I don't think there are going to be many days when New Yorkers wake up with air quality [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=558.04s)]
*  above 400. But we are moving in that direction. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=561.04s)]
*  Things are not going to be as safe and stable when it comes to air quality as we've come [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=564.24s)]
*  to assume. That's especially true in the West when for months out of the year, you can [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=569.04s)]
*  have a bad fire event and a bad wind day and deal with some really horrific impacts [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=574.16s)]
*  already. But it's even true in places that got used to thinking of themselves as living [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=580.12s)]
*  outside of this particular threat, like New York City and Boston, Philadelphia. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=584.16s)]
*  These are places that looked at the West over the last couple of years and we thought, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=588.68s)]
*  well, thank God we're not there. Thank God we don't have to deal with that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  I often thought, how could you live in California given these threats? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  I know people who moved from California to the East Coast to escape the fires and to [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=600.4s)]
*  escape the smoke. And now... [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=605.16s)]
*  It's following them. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=607.56s)]
*  It's following them. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=608.68s)]
*  So, you know, not an AQI of 400 as the new normal, you're saying, but still much less [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=609.72s)]
*  good air. And we'll be dealing with that more and more. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=616.08s)]
*  And the more that we know about that impact, the worse it looks. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=620.24s)]
*  You know, it's emerging research. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  It's developing. The health impacts of pollution generally is a young science. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=624.88s)]
*  The health impacts of wildfire pollution in particular is an even younger science. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  But every new paper revises our estimate in the same direction, which is to say it's [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=633.5200000000001s)]
*  worse than we thought and affecting more things about human health and flourishing [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=638.28s)]
*  than we expected. And so not only are more people dealing with more smoke, but our [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=643.16s)]
*  understanding of what that means for those people is darkening too. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=652.16s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=665.48s)]
*  So, David, given that we should expect to see smoke from wildfires continuing to travel [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=668.28s)]
*  great distances, causing bad air and orange skies far from the places that wildfires are [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  actually burning, what's the impact on people? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  How is this going to affect health? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=689.16s)]
*  Well, I think the best way of thinking about that is to back up a little from wildfire [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=692.1999999999999s)]
*  smoke in particular, because the truth is that the science of those impacts is relatively [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=696.16s)]
*  limited, in part because people haven't been focused on it very long. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=701.12s)]
*  And most of what has been revealed in the science that does study wildfire smoke suggests [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=705.0s)]
*  that it's quite comparable to other kinds of air pollution that are grouped together [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=709.9599999999999s)]
*  in this category called PM 2.5, which has to do with the size of the particular microns [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=715.0799999999999s)]
*  in the in the air. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=720.52s)]
*  I see. So it's the size of those things that you're actually breathing in. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=721.28s)]
*  And we actually know quite a lot about what particulate matter does to our health and [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=724.8s)]
*  can essentially assume that almost anything that we know is caused by it will probably [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  also be caused by wildfire smoke. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=734.0s)]
*  What that says is really quite grim. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=736.16s)]
*  Ten million people are dying a year from air pollution globally. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=739.7199999999999s)]
*  And the estimates vary from source to source. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  But it's in that ballpark. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=748.4s)]
*  And even the really lowball estimates are still in the millions. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=749.76s)]
*  And that number is growing over time, not because the damage is getting worse, but [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=753.92s)]
*  because the more we look, the more impact we see. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=758.36s)]
*  But like, how do people die? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=761.24s)]
*  I mean, how does actually this kind of small particulate matter, as we're all going to [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=763.2s)]
*  have to get used to saying the lingo, right? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=768.4399999999999s)]
*  How does it affect our bodies? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=770.92s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, in almost every way imaginable. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=773.24s)]
*  I mean, there are the intuitive ways you can imagine why breathing really dirty air [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=775.88s)]
*  might exacerbate your asthma condition or even trigger an asthma attack. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=780.2s)]
*  You can imagine how it could worsen other respiratory diseases, you know, COPD, for [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=783.48s)]
*  instance. But the pollution can also affect you in a lot of other less intuitive ways, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  some of which we only understand partially. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=793.6s)]
*  But we do know that the pollution can get into the bloodstream. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=795.44s)]
*  It can cross the blood-brain barrier. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=799.36s)]
*  And almost every aspect of human health that you can imagine is therefore affected by [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=801.48s)]
*  it, because this becomes a circulating pervasive problem for the body. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=806.44s)]
*  So that means it's not just respiratory diseases, it's also coronary diseases. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=811.88s)]
*  It raises rates of cancers of all kinds. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=815.96s)]
*  It has all of kinds of unfortunate and distressing effects on the brain. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=819.0799999999999s)]
*  So it raises rates of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and dementia. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=822.92s)]
*  And it changes your risks for schizophrenia and ADHD and autism, depression, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=827.12s)]
*  suicide, admissions to mental hospitals go up when there's bad air out. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=834.16s)]
*  Additionally, it affects your cognitive performance. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=838.52s)]
*  It changes rates of premature birth and low birth weight. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=842.36s)]
*  And it even affects the health of babies in the womb and in the placenta. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=846.44s)]
*  And there have been studies showing that you can find particulate matter on the inside [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=851.2s)]
*  of placentas extracted from mothers who have just given birth. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=855.48s)]
*  And in fact, when you look from a different perspective, statistically, you can see the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=858.44s)]
*  impact on the health and well-being and indeed other measures of flourishing of those [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=862.84s)]
*  children across their lifespan. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=867.76s)]
*  So you can see the impact, for instance, on their lifetime earnings. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=869.72s)]
*  And those effects are not gargantuan. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not like it means that you're going to go from being a billionaire to being impoverished [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=875.68s)]
*  because, you know, your mother walked through one cloud of smoke when she was giving birth [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=879.8s)]
*  to you. But at the population level, you see some really notable and statistically strong [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  correlations that are horrifying, really, especially when you think you may be living in [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=888.52s)]
*  a place that's dealing with more wildfire smoke in the decades to come. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=892.76s)]
*  Right. I mean, you're saying, you know, clearly the impact of air pollution is bad, but the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=896.04s)]
*  level of exposure does really matter when we're talking about this, right? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=901.0799999999999s)]
*  Like being exposed to this bad air for a few days, like we were in New York, is very [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=904.16s)]
*  different than, you know, being exposed for extended periods of time. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=909.52s)]
*  Yeah, the duration matters a lot. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=913.8s)]
*  The intensity matters a lot. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=915.6s)]
*  The truth is, we don't know precisely how exposure to the air of New York over the last [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=917.12s)]
*  few days is going to compare to, say, someone who spent two years in Delhi breathing in [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=921.48s)]
*  its famously toxic air. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=927.04s)]
*  But, you know, the chances are that the impact will be significant, especially at the population [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=928.88s)]
*  level. And in some pieces I've written in the past, I've called this the sort of law [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=933.24s)]
*  of small numbers in a big world, which is to say if there's a public health impact that [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=937.44s)]
*  raises a population's risk of this or that disease by two or three percent and you're [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  dealing with a population of 330 million people, you know, that can be quite large. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=946.16s)]
*  We learned that through Covid. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=949.88s)]
*  These are not especially high death rates. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=951.4s)]
*  And yet when you see it play out over the course of the country, it's an absolutely brutal [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=952.84s)]
*  toll. And, you know, the effect of fire and wildfire smoke is quite similar. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=957.2800000000001s)]
*  There was a big study published in The Lancet last year that found that living within 30 [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=961.5600000000001s)]
*  miles of just a single fire, so within 30 miles of one fire, meant that over the course [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=966.52s)]
*  of 20 years, your risk of a couple of different kinds of cancer were elevated by five to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=971.0400000000001s)]
*  10 percent. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=975.44s)]
*  And that was like one fire and that was just absolutely conclusive. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=976.16s)]
*  Like that seems kind of shocking. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=979.92s)]
*  Well, like a lot of these studies, you don't want to take any one finding and say this [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=982.12s)]
*  is absolutely true. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=986.84s)]
*  The results are often correlative rather than causal. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=988.16s)]
*  What you want to do is aggregate the whole body of literature and say there's probably [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=991.8s)]
*  some error here. Some things are overstating things, some things are understating the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=995.48s)]
*  findings. But when you look at the whole mass of the literature, you see, wow, air [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=998.64s)]
*  pollution is having an absolutely catastrophic impact on global health. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1003.76s)]
*  It's larger now than the impact of smoking, which was the main story of the last half [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1007.44s)]
*  century in global health. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1012.64s)]
*  And David, how much is smoke from fires affecting the overall air pollution picture? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1014.48s)]
*  Well, the question is different in different parts of the world. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1019.0s)]
*  In the U.S., we have relatively clean air. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1022.9200000000001s)]
*  We've cleaned up quite a lot of the air pollution that we used to see regularly because [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1025.44s)]
*  of fossil fuel burning, you know, cars with worse emission standards or, you know, no [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1030.32s)]
*  emission standards for a very long time. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  And so our air is a lot cleaner than it used to be. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1037.36s)]
*  It's enviably clear by global standards. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1039.44s)]
*  Nevertheless, we still see about 350,000 Americans dying every year from air pollution. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  But wildfire is playing a larger and larger role. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1047.12s)]
*  So we have this longer term trend in which we're drawing down fossil fuel use. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1049.8799999999999s)]
*  We're especially giving up on coal. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1053.84s)]
*  That's true globally, but it's especially true in the U.S. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1055.72s)]
*  And for all these reasons, we're breathing cleaner air and suffering less as a result. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1058.0800000000002s)]
*  But wildfires are at the same time getting worse, producing more particulate pollution, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1061.92s)]
*  which is spreading throughout the country and at the very least clouding that picture [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1067.72s)]
*  and to some degree reversing the gains of the Clean Air Act. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1071.92s)]
*  Depending on where you are in the country, we may have lost as much as 20 or 30 percent [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1074.96s)]
*  of those gains already. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1079.1200000000001s)]
*  Most scientists don't believe we'll be getting anywhere to a total reversal of those [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1081.6000000000001s)]
*  gains anytime soon. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1085.28s)]
*  But it does mean that if you based your expectations for air cleanliness on our experience [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1086.72s)]
*  in the last couple of decades, probably that's going to be getting worse from fire. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1091.76s)]
*  So, David, this conversation is pretty depressing, I'll be honest. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1096.4s)]
*  Can you give me any hope about the future, about how we solve this problem of wildfires? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1101.48s)]
*  Well, you can take action both upstream and downstream. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  So starting with the fires themselves, one of the things that's driving this new fire [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1112.24s)]
*  era is climate change and global warming. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1116.1200000000001s)]
*  And we can limit the effect there by limiting our use of fossil fuels, getting them to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1119.24s)]
*  zero pretty quickly and making sure that the planet's temperature rises only a little [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1124.76s)]
*  bit more and not a lot more. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1129.8000000000002s)]
*  That's really significant. It's a huge challenge, as we all know, thinking about climate [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1132.1200000000001s)]
*  change in other contexts, but it is meaningful. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1135.5600000000002s)]
*  We can also take action at the level of the forests themselves, which is a transformation [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1138.48s)]
*  that's already underway, in part because more and more people are alarmed at the size and [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1143.88s)]
*  intensity and health threat posed by these out of control, totally monumental wildfires. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1147.96s)]
*  And that's to say, undoing the damage that was done by about a half century or more of [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1154.08s)]
*  fire phobic forest management. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1159.64s)]
*  So for many decades, we basically responded to any fire by trying to put it out immediately [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1161.68s)]
*  because we thought all fire was bad. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1166.48s)]
*  And that's contrary to the way that the landscape really operates. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1168.4s)]
*  You know, the natural landscape of any forest is for there to be some significant fire [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1171.96s)]
*  almost all the time. Right. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1177.84s)]
*  But because we spent so long suppressing fire, we now have all of this additional fuel. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1178.96s)]
*  And we are already taking a different approach, which means that we're trying to do more of [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1184.28s)]
*  what are called controlled burns, where we sort of make sure that a certain fire once [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1189.64s)]
*  set will only burn a certain amount of land and then light it and let it burn ourselves. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1195.0s)]
*  So that in a future event, when there's a future non-human accidental or even human, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1200.96s)]
*  but still accidental ignition, the fire won't spread all that much because, you know, a [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1206.44s)]
*  huge chunk of this land will have already burned. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1211.0s)]
*  There are some complications to this program. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1213.24s)]
*  It doesn't mean that no air pollution is produced because fire is fire. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1215.48s)]
*  But if the fires are burning at lower temperatures through certain kinds of brush, as [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1219.44s)]
*  opposed to big trees, you can reduce the amount of exposure, especially if you do it at the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1223.8s)]
*  right time. When there's not much wind, you can sort of make sure that certain local [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1227.8s)]
*  populations are not exposed. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1231.84s)]
*  And that means that, you know, presumably as the climate continues to warm over the next [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1233.48s)]
*  couple of decades, we could also be through those efforts, reducing the amount of fuel it [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1237.1599999999999s)]
*  finds to burn. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1241.9199999999998s)]
*  But David, we in the U.S. can't exactly do more to change Canada, right? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1242.96s)]
*  I mean, that's a more complicated question. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1248.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's one of the sort of unfortunate mind bending features of this new science is the way [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1251.6399999999999s)]
*  in which the effects of these fires cross not just local boundaries, but national boundaries, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1256.8s)]
*  even continental boundaries. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1262.08s)]
*  It is no longer the case that Cal Fire is just managing Californians smoke exposure. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1263.6399999999999s)]
*  They're also managing the smoke exposure of many states across the West and indeed all the [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1271.24s)]
*  way to the other side of the country. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1276.24s)]
*  And in the instance of this event, we're not even dealing with a cross country exposure. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1278.04s)]
*  We're dealing with a international exposure. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1282.3600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it happens that Canada has a close ally of ours and there is a way of [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1284.96s)]
*  coordinating some action there. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1289.72s)]
*  But that's not true for every country in the world. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1291.28s)]
*  And the farther that these effects travel from their source point, the harder it will be [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1293.68s)]
*  for those affected to take action to control what's actually damaging and impacting their [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1298.2s)]
*  lives. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1302.52s)]
*  So because this problem has become so dispersed, smoke travels across international borders, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  right? As you're saying, it's way more complicated to solve, not unlike how climate change [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1308.92s)]
*  has been hard to solve because, you know, you have to get the whole world on board and [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1313.68s)]
*  that's very hard to do. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1317.04s)]
*  Yeah, it wouldn't exactly be easy to solve the problem of wildfire within national borders, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1318.64s)]
*  but it gets a bit harder internationally. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1322.88s)]
*  And I think as a result, it's a little more dispiriting than thinking that it's something [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1325.16s)]
*  that we might be able to commandeer some political response to in a more direct way. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  So, David, given that this is not a problem that's easy to solve and it's not going away [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1333.2s)]
*  anytime soon, I want to focus on what we can do right now, like practically what we can [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1337.64s)]
*  actually accomplish. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1343.76s)]
*  Like, what are you going to do to protect yourself with all this smoke in the air? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1345.32s)]
*  Well, you know, I think everybody probably needs to calibrate their own sense of risk [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1349.0s)]
*  here for themselves. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1352.6000000000001s)]
*  I would say as a broad principle, just keep in mind that, you know, there is a threat [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1353.76s)]
*  out there, but it is not resolvable necessarily at the individual level where you know that [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  if you take one action or another, it will have this very concrete and predictable impact [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1361.36s)]
*  on your particular health in the next week or the next month or even the next year. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1365.6799999999998s)]
*  The last couple of days in New York may well be the worst air quality readings of any city [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1370.04s)]
*  in the world anytime this year. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1374.6s)]
*  And so if you put yourself in a position where you're asking questions like, you know, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1376.1999999999998s)]
*  should I wear a mask outside? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1380.1999999999998s)]
*  Should I go outside? Should I exercise? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1381.1599999999999s)]
*  How much time should I spend outside? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1383.1599999999999s)]
*  Should I open my window? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1385.04s)]
*  Should I close my window? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1386.04s)]
*  You know, one way of thinking about that is like if you were taking a trip to what you [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1387.32s)]
*  knew would be the most polluted place in the entire world this year, would you feel [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1390.44s)]
*  comfortable doing those things? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1395.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1396.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, my own experience over the last couple of days is I've spent some time outside. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1396.72s)]
*  I've mostly been inside. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1401.0s)]
*  I've mostly when I've been outside worn a mask, but I've also stepped outside without a [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1402.6000000000001s)]
*  mask. My windows have been shut. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1407.1200000000001s)]
*  I have air purifiers in my house and I've tried to get my five year old and my two year [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1409.3200000000002s)]
*  old daughter to wear a mask when they were outside, but I did not succeed. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1413.8400000000001s)]
*  And don't feel like I'm throwing them under a bus by bringing them to school without a [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1416.72s)]
*  mask on for a 15 minute walk. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1421.32s)]
*  You know, I wish that they I wish I had persuaded them that I wasn't able to. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1423.9199999999998s)]
*  So you want to try to limit all of the exposure that you can. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1427.04s)]
*  And, you know, to the extent that you can afford it, run some air purifiers to the extent [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1431.44s)]
*  that you can't just, you know, stay away from the outdoors and try to block off the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1436.44s)]
*  openings to where you are. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1440.08s)]
*  And in a way, the pandemic prepared us for some of this, right? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1441.76s)]
*  I mean, we still all have masks tucked up somewhere in a back closet. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1445.0s)]
*  I got mine out this morning. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1449.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it took a year or so into the pandemic for people to know what a KN95 was [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1450.72s)]
*  as opposed to just a mask. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1455.16s)]
*  And now everybody knows exactly what it is. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1456.92s)]
*  We did see the CDC yesterday saying that, you know, masks are not a perfect protection [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  against wildfire smoke, which is worth keeping in mind. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1463.8000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, as with many of these things, it's not about getting yourself from 100 [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1466.8400000000001s)]
*  percent risk to zero risk. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1470.8000000000002s)]
*  It's just about limiting your risk. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1472.16s)]
*  And it's the same with the choices you make about the way you organize your day. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1473.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, probably most people are not going to be comfortable completely suspending all [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1476.6s)]
*  human activity in the event of smoke. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1479.76s)]
*  But, you know, you might make some choices that are different in an environment where [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1482.4399999999998s)]
*  there's a lot of pollution outside versus one where there's not. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1485.3999999999999s)]
*  And among other things that may mean, you know, kids aren't going outside to recess [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1487.6799999999998s)]
*  and maybe when they come home, they don't play around outside in the playground either. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1491.6799999999998s)]
*  They go upstairs instead. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1494.36s)]
*  In general, you know, the less exposure, the better. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1495.76s)]
*  And the choices that you make should be your own responsibility. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1498.24s)]
*  Where you land on that spectrum is, you know, as I say, like more a matter of risk [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1501.76s)]
*  tolerance than hard science. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1505.4399999999998s)]
*  But we're probably going to be learning a lot more about our risk tolerance for smoke [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1506.9199999999998s)]
*  and air pollution than we knew two or three years ago. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  David, thank you. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1517.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1519.56s)]
*  Just want to give a brief update on what's happening with the smoke. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1524.76s)]
*  In New York City on Thursday, Mayor Eric Adams said he expected a gradual improvement of [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1530.44s)]
*  air quality. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1535.4s)]
*  It would be great to see the sun again, but the wind is going to determine that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1536.0s)]
*  But he also said a sea breeze in the afternoon could push the smoke back over the city. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1541.8s)]
*  Stay indoors, stay safe and mask up if you are outside. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1547.52s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1559.44s)]
*  Here's what else you should know today. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1576.3200000000002s)]
*  In a surprise ruling, the Supreme Court found that Alabama's Republican controlled [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1578.56s)]
*  legislature had violated the Voting Rights Act by drawing a congressional map in which [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1583.3600000000001s)]
*  Black voters make up the majority of just a single district. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1588.6399999999999s)]
*  The 5-4 decision broke from the court's recent pattern of weakening the Voting Rights Act, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1593.3999999999999s)]
*  a civil rights era law that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1598.3999999999999s)]
*  As a result of the ruling, Alabama must now draw a second congressional district dominated [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1603.28s)]
*  by Black voters who make up more than a quarter of Alabama's voters overall. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1608.32s)]
*  The ruling could complicate Republicans' years-long effort to redraw congressional [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1613.56s)]
*  voting maps across the country in ways that favor members of their own party and frequently [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1618.24s)]
*  weaken the voting power of minority communities. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1623.68s)]
*  And. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1627.36s)]

*  I'm standing in a giant flood zone because one of Ukraine's largest dams was blown up. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1631.24s)]
*  In southern Ukraine, rescue workers in boats kept up a frantic effort to save thousands [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1636.28s)]
*  of people in the vast flood zone that was created when a dam was blown up earlier this [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1641.6s)]
*  week. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1645.48s)]
*  I'm looking now at four-story buildings with water that comes up to about the middle of [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1645.92s)]
*  the first floor. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1651.44s)]
*  My colleague Andrew Kramer talked to residents who saw cars, animals and even houses floating [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC61-UcSVA&t=1652.56s)]
