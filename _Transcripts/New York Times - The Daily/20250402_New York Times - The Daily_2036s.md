# Shen Yun: The Dark Side of a Dance Troupe
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. This is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=0.0s)]
*  A few days ago, one of the most ubiquitous live shows in the country, Shen Yun, began [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=11.8s)]
*  its latest run at arguably its most prestigious venue, Lincoln Center. It's drawn thousands [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=16.84s)]
*  of people to a performance that is colorful, acrobatic, and, according to many of its performers, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=23.14s)]
*  shockingly abusive. Today, my colleague Nicole Hong on what a Times investigation has found [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=28.76s)]
*  about this secretive and sprawling enterprise. It's Wednesday, April 2nd. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=35.72s)]
*  Nicole, I have seen billboards for Shen Yun literally all over New York City. They are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  pastel colored. They show people dancing. They're wearing this sort of long, flowy, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=57.84s)]
*  diaphanous clothing. But I will admit this, I don't think I've ever actually bothered [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=62.64s)]
*  to look into what these billboards were actually advertising. And now you've done this big [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  investigation into Shen Yun, which I'm really excited to talk about. We're going to get [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=72.02000000000001s)]
*  to in a minute. But first, can you just tell us what exactly is Shen Yun? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=75.92s)]
*  So on the surface, Shen Yun is this performing arts group. They tour around the world. They [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=82.24s)]
*  perform traditional Chinese dance accompanied with a full orchestra. And most people know [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  them because of their advertising. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=95.41999999999999s)]
*  We've seen TV ads, flyers on storefronts, direct mailers into our mailboxes. And they're [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=105.92s)]
*  often advertising these vague slogans. Like China before communism or 5,000 years of civilization [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=125.68s)]
*  reborn. Like many people, I have seen these for years and never thought twice about what [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=138.32s)]
*  this group was. They were just part of the landscape. Yes. But in late 2023, my reporting [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=153.36s)]
*  partner Michael Rothfeld got a tip from someone who was familiar with the inner workings of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Shen Yun and said we should take a closer look at their operations. So we started making [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=167.52s)]
*  phone calls. And of course, we also decided to go to one of their shows in Boston. And [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=175.72000000000003s)]
*  what was that like? So the tickets were actually quite expensive. Our tickets were over $200. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=180.8s)]
*  Wow. Okay. It's like going to Broadway. Yeah. And the show is basically a series of short, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=187.4s)]
*  very choreographed dance and music pieces. And a lot of the scenes are retelling traditional [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  Chinese folk tales and mythology. And the level of dancing is very high level. As I [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=202.62s)]
*  was watching it, it reminded me of Olympic gymnastics or ballet. It's a lot of flips [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=209.04s)]
*  and splits in the air, that kind of thing. But as you get deeper into the show, you start [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=215.84s)]
*  to realize there's also something else going on, which is that there's a sort of spiritual [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  and political element to some of these pieces. So for example, there's this one dance number [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=228.64s)]
*  we saw where a performer is dressed as a police officer for the Chinese Communist Party. And [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=234.74s)]
*  he is beating up this innocent man with a baton in a violent way. And it turns out this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=242.46s)]
*  man is getting beaten for practicing a religion called Falun Gong. And it becomes clear to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=248.62s)]
*  you as an audience member as the show progresses that the show is presenting this religion, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=255.88s)]
*  Falun Gong, as a force for good fighting against the evil of the Chinese government. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=262.22s)]
*  So that is not at all what I was expecting. I mean, I expected that you were going to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=272.14000000000004s)]
*  tell me that it was a show with dancing and colorful costumes and being transported to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=275.70000000000005s)]
*  faraway places. But I did not expect that there would be this whole underlying religious [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  and political message. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  Right. This is not just a dance group. Shen Yun is about spreading the message of this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=287.9s)]
*  religious movement, Falun Gong, to a mainstream audience. And I got to witness this firsthand [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=292.74s)]
*  because when I went to the Boston show, the man sitting next to me I saw at intermission [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=298.82s)]
*  was Googling on his phone, what is Falun Gong? So that indicated to me that the message was [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=305.22s)]
*  penetrating. It was coming through to this audience member. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=312.02s)]
*  Which is what they want. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=314.92s)]
*  Exactly. But at the time, we didn't fully understand the bigger picture. We didn't [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  yet know what was really happening behind the scenes. And when we dug more into Shen [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=322.14000000000004s)]
*  Yun, what we uncovered through many, many months of reporting was this massive operation [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=328.56s)]
*  built on exploitation and coercion, all in service of Falun Gong's religious leader, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  who has turned Shen Yun into a major source of wealth and influence for his movement. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=342.86s)]
*  So tell me about this man and this religious movement. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=350.42s)]
*  So this religious movement, Falun Gong, began in China in the early 1990s. And it was started [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=353.32s)]
*  by this man whose Chinese name is Li Hongzhi. He was actually a grain clerk. But somewhere [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  along the way, he starts traveling across China to introduce this new movement he's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=369.02s)]
*  created. It combines elements of Buddhism with these ancient Chinese energy-based exercises [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=375.82s)]
*  that are known as qigong. These are basically slow movements where you move your hands and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=384.18s)]
*  arms around the body to circulate energy. And Li is teaching his followers his version [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=391.62s)]
*  of these exercises, along with spiritual texts that he's written. And he's promoting this [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=398.98s)]
*  religion not only as a way to improve your health physically, but he's also saying that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=405.72s)]
*  this can help you reach enlightenment, that this is the roadmap to becoming a better and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=410.94s)]
*  more moral person. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=416.4s)]
*  Okay, so far, all of this sounds pretty on par with what you would expect a lot of religions [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=417.7s)]
*  to be. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=422.38s)]
*  Yes. But once you get deeper into the teachings, there are more mystical elements that come [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=423.38s)]
*  up. For example, he has said that advanced practitioners can develop supernatural powers, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=428.97999999999996s)]
*  like the ability to levitate, or the ability to see through walls. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so that seems kind of out there. Are people buying into it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=439.9s)]
*  Yeah, so it's important to understand the context of what was going on in China at the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=443.18s)]
*  time. This is the 1990s. It was a period of economic and political turmoil. Mao Zedong, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=447.42s)]
*  the Communist Party leader, had died not that long ago. And Mao had tried to stamp out traditional [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=455.34000000000003s)]
*  culture and traditional religions during his rule. So when he died, it left a spiritual [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=462.58s)]
*  vacuum in the country. And his death led to this revival of spiritual life in China, including [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=468.98s)]
*  ancient practices like qigong. So as a result, by the mid 1990s, Falun Gong has followers [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=476.82s)]
*  all over China. Many of them said their health did improve through the meditation exercises. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=484.24s)]
*  And so the practice becomes extremely popular. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=489.94s)]
*  So very quickly, it sounds like it becomes a national movement. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=492.58s)]
*  Yeah, and not just a national movement, but an international one. Li actually started [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=495.3s)]
*  taking his lectures and his teachings to the Chinese diaspora overseas. And it catches [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=501.46s)]
*  on in many countries like Australia, Canada, and the US as well. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=509.34s)]
*  The Chinese government has been concerned at how Falun Gong has gained adherence within [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=519.8199999999999s)]
*  the political establishment. But this is where it gets the attention of the Chinese [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=524.42s)]
*  Communist Party. The group claims its practitioners include as many as 100 million people in China, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=529.66s)]
*  a figure disputed by the Chinese government. Obviously, this is an authoritarian regime. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=536.06s)]
*  They are suspicious of any group they cannot control, especially one that can mobilize [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=541.42s)]
*  large groups of people very quickly. And all of this comes to a head in April 1999. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=547.7s)]
*  10,000 people gathered in Beijing at the government leaders compound known as Jingnanhai. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=554.1800000000001s)]
*  More than 10,000 Falun Gong followers had this rally in Beijing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=560.38s)]
*  It was the largest public assembly in the Chinese capital since the Tiananmen Square [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=565.58s)]
*  demonstrations a decade ago. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  And after the rally, this is where the persecution really starts. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=573.5s)]
*  Today in Beijing, arrests of Falun Gong practitioners continued. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=577.44s)]
*  Police and paramilitaries have been drafted into railway stations and bus depots to prevent [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=581.24s)]
*  members of the sect traveling to Beijing to protest. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=585.96s)]
*  Falun Gong is banned in China. China puts out an arrest warrant for Li. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, Chinese state television is running an almost constant video campaign against [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=594.12s)]
*  the group. Newscasts have run pictures showing the group's literature and audio cassettes [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=599.1600000000001s)]
*  being crushed by a steamroller. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=604.32s)]
*  The leadership is now trying to discredit Falun Gong with a barrage of propaganda aimed [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=606.4s)]
*  at showing that devotion can lead to insanity, suicide or murder. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=611.26s)]
*  They start calling this group a, quote, evil cult, which the group has vehemently denied. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=615.64s)]
*  The group has followers in the Communist Party and the military, and many of them have now [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  been sent for so-called re-education in Marxist ideology. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=626.1999999999999s)]
*  And thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are imprisoned. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=631.36s)]
*  They are sent to labor camps. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=635.88s)]
*  They are tortured. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  They are beaten. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=639.98s)]
*  And some of them never make it out. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=641.88s)]
*  They died in custody during long prison terms. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=644.4s)]
*  It was an incredibly brutal response that led many people abroad, including lawmakers [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=648.76s)]
*  in the United States, to consider Falun Gong a persecuted group and a victim of human rights [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=654.32s)]
*  abuses. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=660.8s)]
*  Last week, as the Chinese government stepped up its crackdown against the group, State [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=661.8s)]
*  Department spokesman James Rubin expressed concern. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  We are disturbed by reports of some heavy-handed tactics being used to prevent Chinese citizens [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  from exercising internationally protected fundamental rights and freedoms. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=675.28s)]
*  And I think it's also important to note that this suppression continues to this day. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=680.4399999999999s)]
*  This is starting to explain the scenes in the play that you described of the man who's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=685.4s)]
*  practicing Falun Gong being beaten. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=689.04s)]
*  This is starting to make sense now. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=690.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=692.56s)]
*  You mentioned Lee earlier, the founder of Falun Gong. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=693.56s)]
*  So where is he in the middle of all this? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=697.0s)]
*  So by the late 1990s, in the middle of the persecution, Lee and his family have settled [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=699.92s)]
*  in the United States, in New York. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=706.72s)]
*  This is now his new home base where he directs this global movement. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=709.04s)]
*  The persecution becomes this huge galvanizing and organizing force. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=715.52s)]
*  At this point, Lee's teachings actually take on an apocalyptic tone. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  He starts to portray the situation as this existential battle between the Chinese government [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=727.84s)]
*  and Falun Gong. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=734.6s)]
*  It becomes a fight for survival. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=736.3000000000001s)]
*  So in part to draw global attention to the persecution and to continue to spread the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=739.36s)]
*  religion, Lee and his followers have this idea to put on a traveling show. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=745.64s)]
*  And that's how, in 2006, Shen Yun was born. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=753.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  So everything you just said really helps to explain the show and the framing around, as [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=757.5600000000001s)]
*  you described it, good versus evil and Falun Gong versus the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=761.6s)]
*  But given that the show is essentially propaganda, it does sort of surprise me that it's gotten [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=766.52s)]
*  so ubiquitous that it has billboards literally all over the world. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=772.18s)]
*  So how successful could the show actually be? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=776.74s)]
*  So this show has ended up becoming this huge moneymaker for Falun Gong. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=780.28s)]
*  We are able to look at their tax records because it's registered as a nonprofit. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  And by the end of 2023, they have $266 million in assets. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=792.0s)]
*  They're making tens of millions of dollars a year in ticket sales. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  And they're stockpiling assets at a rate that would be extraordinary for any type of performing [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=803.04s)]
*  arts company, let alone this nonprofit dance group. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=808.1999999999999s)]
*  So how is this possible? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=812.86s)]
*  How are they making so much money with this show? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=814.28s)]
*  It's possible because Li has these legions of followers in countries all over the world [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=817.72s)]
*  who are devoted to him, devoted to this fight against the Chinese Communist Party, and are [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  willing to make all of these sacrifices for him. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=831.88s)]
*  But what our reporting uncovered was the extent of that sacrifice. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=839.02s)]
*  The success of Shen Yun has also come at this extraordinary cost. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=844.9200000000001s)]
*  And much of it has been at the expense of Li's most loyal followers, who have sometimes [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=851.12s)]
*  dedicated their entire lives and livelihoods to carry out his vision. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=858.36s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=874.44s)]
*  So Nicole, your investigation pulls back the curtain on the inner workings of this show. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=887.2s)]
*  And what you found is a system that's far more complex and sounds like it exploits people [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=892.36s)]
*  in a way that might not be apparent at first blush. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=899.0s)]
*  So walk us through how all of this works. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=902.56s)]
*  So there are three main ways that Shen Yun is essentially built on the backs of its followers. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=906.04s)]
*  One has to do with the performers in Shen Yun, the dancers and musicians. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=913.5999999999999s)]
*  The second has to do with the Falun Gong followers who help to finance the shows. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=919.1199999999999s)]
*  And the third way involves the Falun Gong practitioners who run and operate this sophisticated [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=927.2800000000001s)]
*  media network to promote the show and also attack its critics. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=934.96s)]
*  So let's start with the first piece that you outlined, the people who are actually performing [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=940.2800000000001s)]
*  in these shows. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  How do they fit in? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  So we interviewed dozens of dancers, musicians, and instructors who used to perform for Shen [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=946.7800000000001s)]
*  Yun or work for Shen Yun. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=955.28s)]
*  And what we learned was that many of the performers in Shen Yun are brought to New York when they [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=957.76s)]
*  are as young as 11 years old. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=965.04s)]
*  They come from all over the world and they've typically grown up in Falun Gong households. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=968.16s)]
*  This is the religion that they practiced with their parents. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=973.28s)]
*  And their parents were very eager to send them to Shen Yun because this dance group [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=976.8s)]
*  is seen as a holy honor for any practitioner to participate in. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=982.42s)]
*  And the way they join this group is that they're brought to this enormous 400-acre compound [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=987.9399999999999s)]
*  called Dragon Springs where Li himself is based. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=994.2199999999999s)]
*  And just to illustrate how they view him there, at Dragon Springs there is this giant golden [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=998.78s)]
*  Buddha statue. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1004.18s)]
*  The face of this Buddha looks a lot like Li. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1005.74s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1008.3399999999999s)]
*  It sounds like he's basically made himself into a god-like figure. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1009.34s)]
*  Yeah, many Falun Gong practitioners see him as a living god. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1012.86s)]
*  They want their kids to be close to Li. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1016.6600000000001s)]
*  And so these young performers end up living and training at Dragon Springs, sometimes [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1019.94s)]
*  well into their 20s. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1025.54s)]
*  So what is daily life actually like for these young students who end up living at the compound? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1027.32s)]
*  What we found in our interviews is that it was a very grueling environment both physically [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1032.66s)]
*  and mentally. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1037.92s)]
*  Many of them described often working or training 15 hours a day, six days a week. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1039.98s)]
*  They're essentially working a professional workload as students, but they're getting [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1045.8200000000002s)]
*  little to no pay. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1050.5800000000002s)]
*  We spoke to a lot of people who said they weren't paid at all during their first year [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1051.9s)]
*  on tour. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1054.9s)]
*  Their access to outside information is heavily controlled. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1056.44s)]
*  Some students told us they got in trouble if they were caught watching unapproved movies [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1060.26s)]
*  or listening to music that was created after the year 1900. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1065.66s)]
*  You're encouraged to inform on your classmates if you see them breaking the rules. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1071.42s)]
*  And the rule breakers can actually face these public critique sessions in front of all of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1077.26s)]
*  their peers. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1082.5s)]
*  And one of the things we heard repeatedly from people is that they were discouraged [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1083.5s)]
*  from seeking medical help if they got injured. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1088.98s)]
*  And this is tied to Li's teachings. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1091.66s)]
*  He says that negative karma causes illness and that if you're a true believer, you can [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1095.06s)]
*  expel that from your body. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1099.72s)]
*  So for example, we spoke to one dancer who said that right before a performance, she [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  was practicing a flip and then dislocated her kneecap. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1106.28s)]
*  One of her classmates popped it back into place and she just performed through it for [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1109.86s)]
*  two hours in completely excruciating pain. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  But she was terrified to ask for medical treatment and she also didn't get any because if you [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  do, you get shamed as someone who is not a devout Falun Gong practitioner. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1124.24s)]
*  There was also this former violinist in Shen Yun's orchestra who told us that he started [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1129.74s)]
*  feeling these sharp pains in his shoulder. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1135.76s)]
*  So he was brought to see Li, who touched his shoulder and then told him he was healed. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1139.16s)]
*  When the pain kept going, the violinist classmates told him, oh, that's because your faith is [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1146.66s)]
*  not strong enough. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1151.8s)]
*  It wasn't until years later that he discovered the cause of the pain was actually a bulging [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1153.26s)]
*  disc in his spine. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1159.0s)]
*  And this was a consistent theme that we heard from a lot of people. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1160.78s)]
*  The conditions sound so extreme. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1164.06s)]
*  Some of the injuries that you just described, having to dance through a busted kneecap, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1169.82s)]
*  why do people put up with this or why do their parents let them stay? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1176.4s)]
*  It has a lot to do with what Li was telling the performers about their duty to Shen Yun. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1179.88s)]
*  We learned that Li was telling them the purpose of a Shen Yun show is not only to educate [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1186.2800000000002s)]
*  audiences, but to actually save them from the end times, this end times that is coming. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1192.2600000000002s)]
*  The idea is that if audience members believe in Falun Gong's message, they'll be saved [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1199.16s)]
*  when the universe is destroyed. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1204.88s)]
*  Some of the performers said they were told that any mistakes they made on stage could [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1207.4399999999998s)]
*  actually doom their audiences to hell. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1211.98s)]
*  These young people aren't just performing. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1214.9399999999998s)]
*  They actually believe they are responsible for people's salvation. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1216.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1220.48s)]
*  One of the dancers we talked to said he had this attitude that if he did not do well as [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1221.48s)]
*  a Shen Yun performer, then the universe wouldn't be saved and it would be his fault. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1226.8799999999999s)]
*  This is the kind of pressure that a lot of these performers, many of whom are teenagers, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1234.0s)]
*  are hearing. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1239.16s)]
*  Another reason that many of them are terrified to leave is financial. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1240.84s)]
*  They get free tuition, free housing, free food. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1245.74s)]
*  It's a full scholarship to a boarding school, essentially. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1249.58s)]
*  And when they try to quit, many of them are told, if you leave, you're going to have [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1253.08s)]
*  to pay all of that back. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1256.68s)]
*  Now we did not actually hear from anyone that they tried to seek repayment, but the threat [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1258.48s)]
*  of it was enough to keep many of them there. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1263.46s)]
*  So basically, all of these different incentives, all of these different pressures are allowing [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1266.3s)]
*  Li to get cheap or free labor from these young people. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1270.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1275.7s)]
*  And that's not the only way his followers are propping up the mission. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1276.7s)]
*  They're also giving large amounts of their money to Li's movement. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1279.98s)]
*  So the way these Shen Yun shows work, they put on hundreds of shows a year during their [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1284.7s)]
*  world tour. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1289.26s)]
*  And there are a lot of costs to putting on a show, for example. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1291.1s)]
*  The ads, the billboards, someone has to go out and print the flyers and put them up in [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1295.54s)]
*  storefronts. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1301.02s)]
*  Someone has to pay for hotel rooms and meals for the performers. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1302.5s)]
*  Someone has to book the venue. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1306.96s)]
*  In each location, most of the costs for putting on that show are taken on by local followers [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1309.04s)]
*  of Falun Gong. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1316.7s)]
*  So the followers are actually putting up the money for the production costs of the show. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1318.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1322.5400000000002s)]
*  And these are essentially unpaid volunteers who organize to put on Shen Yun shows. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1323.5400000000002s)]
*  And if the shows do well, they get their money back, but any profit has to go back to Shen [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1330.0600000000002s)]
*  Yun. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1335.0600000000002s)]
*  If the shows lose money, the followers are the ones responsible for making up that shortfall. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1336.0600000000002s)]
*  So they're in a very vulnerable position. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1341.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1343.42s)]
*  We've also obtained internal messages to Falun Gong followers that say a show in this particular [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1344.5800000000002s)]
*  city is not selling well, so you guys either need to work harder to sell tickets or you [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1351.38s)]
*  need to buy up some of them yourself. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1357.54s)]
*  And Li has publicly said that ticket sales are a sign of your spiritual devotion. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1360.5800000000002s)]
*  So many followers feel this urgent pressure to sell as many tickets as they can. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1366.68s)]
*  This helps explain why in your local city you might see so many ads for Shen Yun. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1373.22s)]
*  And all of this helps explain why they could be so incredibly profitable. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1378.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1382.34s)]
*  But where is the money going? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1383.34s)]
*  How is it being used? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1384.6599999999999s)]
*  So we don't exactly know. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1386.62s)]
*  A lot of their financial records are opaque and we can't see where the money is going. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1388.5s)]
*  But we did uncover the story of one Falun Gong follower that could offer us a clue. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1394.62s)]
*  So there was this woman who was Shen Yun's bookkeeper. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1402.04s)]
*  She was a very, very devoted practitioner. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1405.94s)]
*  Both of her kids performed with Shen Yun. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1408.6399999999999s)]
*  She spent most of her time at Dragon Springs working for Shen Yun and for the Li family. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1411.72s)]
*  And around 2018, 2019, she was getting very sick. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1419.1599999999999s)]
*  Because she was a diligent Falun Gong believer, she resisted seeing a doctor for a long time. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1424.0s)]
*  When she finally did, she found out that she had kidney cancer. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1430.1599999999999s)]
*  But she told her kids that she wouldn't be able to pay for medical treatment because [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1434.8799999999999s)]
*  she had donated all of her money to Dragon Springs. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1439.8s)]
*  And this was a huge shock to them. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1443.4399999999998s)]
*  But after the bookkeeper died of cancer, a Shen Yun employee accidentally mailed the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1446.84s)]
*  bookkeeper's credit card statement to her family. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1452.9599999999998s)]
*  What they eventually saw in the statements were tens of thousands of dollars in purchases [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1456.8s)]
*  of luxury goods from brand names like Hermes, Van Cleef, and Ferragamo. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1461.4s)]
*  We've heard from many former performers that Li's wife liked to dress well. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1468.72s)]
*  She liked to wear luxury brands. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1474.38s)]
*  The bookkeeper had also spent money on custom billiard cues. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1476.94s)]
*  And we know that Li loves to play pool. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1481.46s)]
*  So basically, the assessment was that these purchases were likely for the Li family. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1483.86s)]
*  What we found was that she was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars for purchases that [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1487.86s)]
*  her family believed were for the Li family and for Shen Yun. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1494.8s)]
*  We also found that she was paying for the monthly cell phone bills of Li and his wife. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1499.3799999999999s)]
*  And our reporting showed that some of the money was repaid to her family. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1505.54s)]
*  But because it was all part of this confidentiality agreement, we don't know a lot of the details. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1510.18s)]
*  So the purchases, the fact that she didn't seek medical treatment, the fact that she [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1520.18s)]
*  didn't have money when she did seek medical treatment, it seems like this bookkeeper is [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1523.58s)]
*  emblematic of how much these followers are giving to Falun Gong, whether it's their [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1528.3s)]
*  money or their labor. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1531.9s)]
*  And it also shows the extent to which this institution, and maybe even the lifestyle [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1533.82s)]
*  of the Li family, is made possible by these sacrifices. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1538.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1541.7800000000002s)]
*  I also want to come back to something you said earlier, because you mentioned that even [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1542.7800000000002s)]
*  beyond all of that, there's actually a third piece of this puzzle. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1546.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1549.98s)]
*  That is their media arm, primarily a newspaper run by Falun Gong practitioners called The [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1550.98s)]
*  Epoch Times. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1555.8200000000002s)]
*  I've heard of it, but tell us a little bit more about it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1557.3000000000002s)]
*  So this newspaper has been around since the persecution. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1559.9s)]
*  It was initially started by Falun Gong followers in the year 2000 as a way to raise awareness [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1562.54s)]
*  about human rights abuses in China, including the persecution of Falun Gong. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1569.54s)]
*  And it specifically rose to prominence in the U.S. after the 2016 presidential election [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1574.78s)]
*  by promoting right-wing conspiracy theories and also by embracing President Donald J. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1581.34s)]
*  Trump as someone who supports the paper's opposition to the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1587.18s)]
*  And in fact, Cash Patel, who was recently confirmed as Trump's FBI director, actually [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1594.5s)]
*  had a show with The Epoch Times in recent years where he got a sit-down interview with [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1600.6200000000001s)]
*  Trump. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1606.94s)]
*  But beyond their political coverage, what our investigation found was that they have [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1608.02s)]
*  more than 17,000 articles about Shen Yun. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1613.14s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1617.3400000000001s)]
*  And they're typically glowing audience testimonials after each show. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1618.7800000000002s)]
*  We found that they have this special team of reporters that go to the shows who are [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1624.3400000000001s)]
*  almost always Falun Gong followers. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1629.5800000000002s)]
*  They're often working all night, getting very little sleep, to get these reviews published [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1632.3400000000001s)]
*  as quickly as possible. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1637.74s)]
*  And do we know how influential they've actually been, though? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1639.44s)]
*  So we don't exactly know how much influence this coverage has had. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1642.0s)]
*  For example, we don't know how many ticket sales can be attributed to Epoch Times coverage. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1646.72s)]
*  But this is some pretty unusual editorial treatment for a newspaper to give to a dance [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1652.8s)]
*  show. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1659.84s)]
*  We actually obtained internal editing guides that said anything negative about Shen Yun [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1660.92s)]
*  could not be published. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1667.12s)]
*  And Li himself has way more influence over the newspaper's operations than we realized. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1669.46s)]
*  So for example, we found out about this meeting in 2023 where he gave direct editorial guidance [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1675.9399999999998s)]
*  to top Epoch Times editors. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1682.86s)]
*  So it seems clear that even if we can't pinpoint exactly how influential The Epoch Times is [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1685.36s)]
*  in this larger ecosystem, it is part of this huge network that you've helped to reveal [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1690.2s)]
*  a new reporting. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1695.1599999999999s)]
*  And that network seems like at the center of it are these followers who in many cases [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1697.02s)]
*  have been quite mistreated. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1701.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm curious about the response to that part of your reporting about that mistreatment. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1703.18s)]
*  So since we've published our reporting, New York state regulators have been looking into [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1707.94s)]
*  Shen Yun for their labor practices. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1713.22s)]
*  We also found out that there's a federal criminal investigation into Shen Yun, including into [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1715.96s)]
*  their finances, and a former dancer has sued them and accused them of forced labor. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1721.9s)]
*  And how has Li and Falun Gong responded to all of this? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1729.7800000000002s)]
*  They've denied wrongdoing. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1732.98s)]
*  They say that everything they're doing is legal. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1734.5400000000002s)]
*  A major part of their response to our reporting is to say that our sources are Chinese spies, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1738.42s)]
*  their followers have relentlessly attacked The Times, they've attacked me personally. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1747.98s)]
*  Oh wow, during the course of your reporting. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1755.74s)]
*  Yeah, they've even published false information about my family all over the internet, calling [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1757.74s)]
*  all of us agents of the Chinese government. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1762.34s)]
*  So this is their playbook for responding to scrutiny or criticism. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1764.78s)]
*  And you can often see a lot of these responses published in The Epoch Times as news articles. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1771.34s)]

*  like a persecutor just in terms of what they're doing to crack down on dissent and keep their [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1786.84s)]
*  followers in line. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1791.4199999999998s)]
*  So that has been one of the themes that has really stuck with me throughout this reporting. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1793.4199999999998s)]
*  It's something that's come up over and over again in our interviews with people who either [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1800.26s)]
*  personally survived the persecution in China or had family members go through it. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1805.8000000000002s)]

*  And many of them were so happy when they got into Shen Yun. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1823.2800000000002s)]
*  And when they got to Dragon Springs, they just felt this overwhelming sense of relief. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1827.48s)]
*  So it was especially devastating once they actually saw how the group operated, that [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1832.88s)]
*  this thing that they had devoted their entire lives to turned out to be something completely different. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1839.44s)]

*  It was a major victory for Democrats in an election that had become a referendum on President [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1904.52s)]
*  Trump and Elon Musk, who spent $25 million supporting the Republican-aligned candidate. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1909.08s)]
*  Musk's interest in the race was so intense that he offered $100 to any registered voter [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1915.8s)]
*  who signed a petition related to the race and then entered those voters into a lottery [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1920.36s)]
*  to win a check for $1 million. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1924.92s)]
*  And... [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1927.68s)]

*  I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1934.0s)]
*  for as long as I am physically able. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1939.04s)]
*  I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1942.4s)]
*  And I believe that... [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1946.2s)]
*  On Tuesday night, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker broke the record for speaking on the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1947.28s)]
*  Senate floor more than 25 hours without a break, during which he criticized the Trump [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1951.6000000000001s)]
*  administration for violating the Constitution and disregarding the needs of everyday Americans. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1957.0s)]
*  So I've tried over the last 25 hours and one minute to center the conversation back on [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1962.44s)]
*  what will we do of good conscience. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lV8u-5d7I&t=1970.28s)]
