# The Staggering Success of Trumpâ€™s Trial Delay Tactics
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2j9nFdprnA)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Today, for Donald Trump, 2024 was supposed to be dominated by criminal trials. Instead,
*  he's found ways to delay almost all of them. My colleague, Alan Feuer, on how Trump did
*  it. It's Thursday, April 11th.
*  So, Alan, we are on the cusp of the very first criminal trial of former President Donald
*  Trump, which begins next week. So all eyes are going to be on Lower Manhattan.
*  Yeah, and you'll definitely remember this case, Michael. It's often shorthanded as the
*  hush money case. It involves allegations that Trump used illegal accounting techniques to
*  hide the fact that he had paid off a porn star. Prosecutors say he wanted to cover up
*  a sexual affair that they had had so that the scandal didn't blow up Trump's 2016 presidential
*  campaign. Right. You know, that case, which has always been a weird mix of tabloid and election
*  interference stuff, it's sometimes written off as the runt of the various cases Trump is facing,
*  even though that's not quite true. Nonetheless, it is the exception in one important way. It is
*  actually going to go in front of a jury before the election takes place, before voters go to the
*  polls. Let's not forget Trump is facing four criminal cases in four separate cities. And in
*  three of them, he and his legal team have managed in various ways to throw sand into the gears of
*  these proceedings to essentially grind them down to all but a halt.
*  Right. It appears that Trump has found a way to push back basically 75% of the criminal cases
*  brought against him until it looks like for now, after voters are going to decide whether or not
*  to reelect him, which if it stays that way, would be a pretty astonishing accomplishment of a kind
*  in, I'd argue, both a legal and a political sense.
*  Yeah, it would be a remarkable subversion of the normal course of justice. And look, for that reason
*  alone, it makes sense at studying some of the tactics that Trump's lawyers have used in each
*  of these cases, filing motion after motion after motion after motion, many of which are filled
*  with far-fetched or even frivolous claims. And one of the places where we've seen this
*  in the starkest terms is in Trump's classified documents case in Florida. This is the case
*  in which Trump has been charged with taking home from the White House a trove of extremely
*  classified documents containing all kinds of national defense secrets about military capabilities,
*  nuclear programs, and storing them in crazy places in his home at Mar-a-Lago down in West Palm Beach,
*  Florida. Right. I'm remembering the photos. I mean, stages,
*  bathrooms, closets. Yes. And on top of that, the government has accused him of obstructing
*  this long attempt, this repeated attempts by the authorities to get that stuff back.
*  In some sense, this case is the strongest criminal case that has been brought against Trump.
*  The facts are, at least alleged by the government, are pretty damning. Not to mention he's caught on
*  a recording at one point showing some of this material to other people at Mar-a-Lago and saying
*  to them, hey, I shouldn't be showing you this stuff because it's classified.
*  Right. A prosecutor's dream. Yeah. Yeah. In many ways.
*  So Alan, if this seemed like perhaps the strongest of the four criminal cases against Trump,
*  what exactly is the story of how he and his lawyers have delayed it to the point where it
*  does not appear that there will be a trial before November, before the election?
*  Well, look, in short, Trump's lawyers have raised a series of far-fetched defenses and the judge in
*  this case has really engaged with these defenses and entertained these arguments in a way that,
*  frankly, I don't think most federal judges would have.
*  So tell us about both Trump's tactics and about this judge.
*  We can do both at the same time, Michael. So let's not forget that the first big
*  public event of this case was a search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club and residence
*  in West Palm Beach in Florida. And the consequences of that search fall into the hands of a very
*  unusual judge who catches this case. Her name is Aline Cannon. She was appointed by Trump himself
*  in Trump's waning days in office. And she is a young judge and checks all the boxes,
*  Federalist Society and clerked for a conservative judge herself. But while she may have had all the
*  right kinds of experience, she just didn't have a lot of experience. So at the moment that she
*  inherits this case in August of 2022, she's only been on the bench two years. She's had a sum total
*  of 14 trial days over the course of four trials. She's only had four trials. And so she is the
*  person who kind of inherits this enormous case involving at that point, an FBI search of a
*  former president's residence. And really right from the beginning, Trump's lawyers just throw
*  everything they can at this search warrant issue, trying to bog the entire investigation down.
*  And they end up challenging the search in a really weird way. They say because Trump is a former
*  president, he has executive privilege over all the material that the FBI took out of Mar-a-Lago.
*  And so the lawyers want Judge Cannon not only to appoint an independent arbiter to sort through
*  all that material and sort of take out the innocuous stuff from the stuff that's highly
*  privileged, they want the judge to essentially interfere in this case to the point of freezing
*  the FBI's investigation entirely until this independent arbiter's work is done.
*  So that's a very ambitious request. Trump's lawyers want a major FBI investigation into a
*  former president, very high profile, to just go on ice while some legal figure sorts through paper
*  to see if something's in there that shouldn't be.
*  Yes, exactly. And lo and behold, Judge Cannon grants this request. She freezes the case.
*  But the appellate court that sits over Judge Cannon, the 11th Circuit, very quickly and very
*  forcefully smacks her down and reverses her and essentially says, look, you have violated the
*  principle of the rule of law. You can't just make an exception in this case because the guy happens
*  to be a former president. That's not how US law works. But in the meantime, there has been a
*  delay, a delay of several weeks in a case where every day, every week counts.
*  Yes, that's exactly right. So this was like the prelude to the main event, so to speak. This is
*  before the indictment against Trump was filed. But we've seen very much the same dynamic play out
*  through the totality of the case once the indictment was formally brought.
*  Well, describe how these tactics play out once there is an actual
*  indictment against Trump for taking these documents.
*  Sure. So, you know, within months of the indictment being filed, Trump's lawyers start
*  submitting just a barrage of motions to Judge Cannon in this case. They make a really out there
*  motion to kind of rummage through the communications of all these various national
*  security officials because they want to prove that the deep state collaborated in order to
*  bring this case against Trump. They're filing motions saying like, oh, other politicians and
*  public figures have found classified documents in their possession, but they were never charged.
*  And Trump is being singled out unfairly as the only guy who's been charged in this case.
*  So they're they're burying Judge Cannon in paper.
*  They are burying her in paper and things are really just sort of piling up on her desk in a
*  way that at least from the outside looks like she's really struggling to prioritize decisions and
*  she's leaving this logjam of unresolved issues that just keeps growing and growing. And one of
*  the ultimate consequences of all of this is that she can't set a trial date yet because she hasn't
*  made all of these subsidiary decisions. So the logjam itself makes the delay problem even worse.
*  And of course, none of this seems all that surprising because as you have said,
*  she is a brand new judge. She's never before handled a case on this scale.
*  Sure. And it's very clear that Trump's lawyers are leveraging both her inexperience and some sort of
*  prior indication by her that she is willing to entertain unorthodox arguments. And so one of the
*  most unorthodox arguments that they make in a motion to Judge Cannon is one, to dismiss the case
*  altogether because of a law known as the Presidential Records Act.
*  Okay. And here you're going to have to educate us.
*  Yeah. So the quick gloss on the Presidential Records Act is that it was passed after Watergate
*  to essentially ensure that most records created during a president's time in office remain in the
*  possession of the government. They go to the National Archives. And while the law does sort
*  of permit presidents to lay personal claim to things like diaries they kept while in office
*  or notes or stuff of an obvious personal nature, the point is that the people through the government
*  and the archives own the official records of a presidency. That seems like it would be a law
*  that would be very bad for Trump in this case. Right. Except he has flipped this law entirely
*  on its head in his defense. He argued in a motion that was filed at the end of February
*  that under the small section of the law that allows presidents to designate records as personal,
*  he has designated all of this super secret, highly classified military and defense records
*  as personal and his own property. And to make matters even a little stranger, he's not saying
*  that he issued a proclamation or wrote a formal notification that he did this. He's saying the
*  fact that he took these records out of the White House to his home in Florida de facto shows you
*  that they are his because if they weren't his he would have given them back. He's basically saying
*  these classified government records, including nuclear plans and war plans, they're my private
*  records because I took them, which sounds a little bit like they're my private personal records
*  because I say they are. Right. Exactly. And so how does Judge Cannon respond to this innovative,
*  unexpected unorthodox motion? Well, look, the fact is that most federal judges when presented with
*  this claim would have dismissed it out of hand, would not have held a hearing,
*  would not have entertained it, would have said, thank you, Mr. Trump, for your argument, motion
*  denied. But Judge Cannon decides to take it quite seriously. And that has the effect not just of
*  further delaying the process as she decides how to grapple with this argument,
*  but also it sets up the possibility that she could kill this case altogether without it
*  ever going in front of a jury. We'll be right back.
*  Alan, at this point in our story, this case of Trump and the missing classified documents
*  is delayed and delayed. And now Judge Cannon is engaging with this very unusual argument that
*  Trump can almost wordlessly authorize himself to take classified materials home from the White
*  House. I have to imagine that federal prosecutors are trying to fight this in every way imaginable.
*  Yes, they hate this claim and they are absolutely fighting it every which way they can. And let's
*  not forget, the person in charge of the prosecution at this point is the special counsel, Jack Smith,
*  who was brought into the case really when Trump announced he was running for president. So there
*  was sort of, you know, some independence from the Justice Department. Right. And so what Smith does
*  when confronted with his argument advanced by Trump is, of course, you know, he files a motion
*  trying to oppose Trump's motion to dismiss. And then there's a hearing. And at the hearing,
*  you know, his prosecutors are telling Judge Cannon, this is not what the Presidential Records Act
*  says. Trump has this wrong. The idea that he could sort of like wordlessly transform this material
*  into his own personal property is absurd. And you should just get rid of this argument altogether.
*  And what's interesting is that for a moment there, it really looked like Cannon was going to rule
*  against Trump's Presidential Records Act defense. But then a few days after the hearing, she made an
*  extremely unusual move. And what she did was she asked both sides, the defense and prosecution,
*  to write jury instructions that sort of adopted Trump's Presidential Records Act defense.
*  And why would she want this in jury instructions, especially if she has cast doubt on it?
*  Yes. Well, you've hit on exactly what made this whole thing so weird and curious. Just as a basic
*  matter, jury instructions are generally decided on the eve of a trial. So it's weird to be thinking
*  about how to instruct a jury when the jury hasn't even been selected yet. There isn't even a solid
*  trial date for this case at this point. But the idea that we're working with here is simply that
*  jury instructions are the way that a judge explains the case to jurors. Sort of what's the law here?
*  How should it be interpreted? You know, I think a familiar example might be in a murder trial,
*  for instance, a judge will explain to the jury the legal difference between, say, manslaughter
*  and homicide, sort of guiding them in how to interpret the law so that they can decide whether
*  or not a person has actually broken it. The unusual part in this case is that Judge Cannon
*  has seemed to adopt Trump's own interpretation of the Presidential Records Act. And if she was using
*  that concept to help guide the jury towards making a decision on guilt or innocence,
*  it was almost like she was nudging them towards an acquittal. Because if the stuff is indeed his
*  own personal property, then the jury only has one way to decide. Right? Right. If it really is his
*  personal property, they have to acquit. And so nobody was quite sure, including, mind you,
*  Jack Smith, about what she was doing because it was so unusual and unorthodox. Right. And if you're
*  the prosecutor, you might be confused about what the judge is doing here, but you're definitely
*  not confused about how dangerous it is to your case. And to add something even more damaging to
*  the case, once a jury is seated, the concept of double jeopardy comes into play, right? That's
*  that you can't be tried twice for the same crime. So if the jury acquits Trump using these jury
*  instructions based on his own defense, it's over. There's no appeal. There's nothing Jack Smith
*  can do about it. Case closed. Move on. Got it. So we're kind of back where we were a few minutes
*  ago, which is to say federal prosecutors really do not want Judge Cannon to in any way endorse
*  this. Correct. And so what ends up happening is they file a barnstormer of a response to Judge
*  Cannon's request for jury instructions. It's the kind of stuff that you never hear prosecutors
*  say to a federal judge. Like what? Well, for example, one, you've got this whole thing wrong.
*  Your idea that the Presidential Records Act has anything to do with this case is totally legally
*  flawed. It's a fiction that Trump made up out of whole cloth, and it belongs nowhere in this case
*  at all. And so they ask Judge Cannon to do two things. They say, look, the normal way to proceed
*  here is just go back to the motion to dismiss this case based on the Presidential Records Act
*  and reject it out of hand. Just tell Trump, you can't have this case thrown out before it goes to
*  a jury making this argument. And don't put this stuff into the jury instructions. And he gave
*  her jury instructions that in his mind would follow the law and had nothing to do with the
*  Presidential Records Act. So it sounds like this motion from the federal prosecutors from
*  Jack Smith has the quality of almost tutoring Judge Cannon in the ways of the law, in the order in
*  which she should be doing things. Basically, it's Jack Smith saying to Judge Cannon, you really don't
*  get this. Correct. But in a not so gentle way. Okay, so what does Judge Cannon do with this perhaps
*  not so diplomatic response from the federal prosecutors? She kind of splits the baby. On the
*  one hand, she gives Jack Smith a little bit of what he wants. She rejects altogether Trump's
*  motion to dismiss the case based on the Presidential Records Act. And she agrees with Jack Smith that
*  like this notion that Trump declared this stuff his own personal property, it's not enough just
*  to kill the case before it even goes to trial at all. Got it. And yet, and yet, in a very prickly
*  way in her order, she tells Jack Smith that she's going to keep this idea of using the Presidential
*  Records Act in the jury instructions open. And so she's essentially allowing the possibility that
*  there's still this sort of existential threat hanging over the case when it eventually goes
*  into jury deliberations. Got it. So this particular delay tactic from Trump and his lawyers,
*  this effort to kind of invert the meaning of the Presidential Records Act, it's not just a very
*  successful delay tactic, which, as we've established, it very much seems it is. It now has become
*  a giant threat to the federal government's case and potentially a strong basis for Trump to prevail
*  in this case that seemed very strong and a case that Trump would have a hard time willing out of.
*  Yeah, Trump's lawyers raised this wacky argument in the kind of normal way you do it in the context
*  of a motion to dismiss. So what's most unusual, setting aside the unusual nature of the defense
*  itself, is the way Judge Cannon said no to the motion to dismiss and yet allowed this wacky
*  defense argument to linger in the context of jury instructions. And that was not something Trump's
*  lawyers asked for. That was wholly of Judge Cannon's devising. She came up with that idea herself.
*  That's what makes this all so strange. So now I'm curious, Alan, if this classified
*  documents prosecution had proceeded down a traditional normal path without this
*  very unique interplay of Trump's delay tactics and what seems like, for him, the lucky draw
*  of a pretty inexperienced, slow-moving judge willing to entertain a lot of his unusual arguments,
*  when do we think this trial would have probably started?
*  Well, Judge Cannon had initially said it was going to start at the end of May, but then she
*  very quickly kind of said that was not going to happen. I mean, she's got like 15 to 20 motions
*  sitting on her desk that she hasn't decided. And, you know, some of them could wind up being appealed.
*  She could set hearings, right, two or three days to argue about this stuff. And so it's just she
*  has left a mountain of unfinished business complicate the trial schedule.
*  So that is how we arrive at this reality that Trump's strategy has already basically succeeded
*  in keeping this case from unfolding before Election Day.
*  Yeah. And don't forget, it's not just in that case, you know, two of Trump's other criminal
*  cases also don't have trial dates yet. I mean, you know, his case in Washington involving
*  January 6 and the run up to it, he used a kind of similar wacky motion to dismiss that he managed
*  to get all the way up to the Supreme Court. And, you know, we're waiting for the Supreme Court
*  to render a decision to see whether or not that case sneaks in before the election or not.
*  And then in Georgia, where Trump has been charged also with election interference,
*  he kind of capitalized on this romantic relationship that the prosecutor Fannie Willis
*  had with one of her deputies and bury the judge with a bunch of motions, claiming that
*  there was a conflict of interest due to that relationship. And that ate up, you know, a period
*  of almost two months. So I want to know how you're thinking about this as someone who has covered
*  courts and criminal justice for so long. Trump didn't invent the idea of seeking to delay
*  the wheels of our criminal justice system. Corporations have been doing it for a long time.
*  Rich people with fancy lawyers, they do this kind of thing. But it does seem that he has been
*  stunningly successful at it. And I wonder how you think about it.
*  Well, look, one way to think about it is that the criminal justice system itself just really isn't
*  set up to handle a situation when you have a sophisticated group of lawyers who really just
*  wake up and just figure out ways in which to delay and hinder each of the four cases that Trump is
*  in. That's all they're doing. The entirety of the strategy here is to file motions of oftentimes,
*  you know, limited legal value, just to kind of gum things up. And if these lawyers are able to kind of
*  present a unified strategy in each of the cases, there's very little that the prosecution can do
*  about it except respond in a really reactive way, because they are essentially having to play Trump's
*  game at this point. And the way the system is set up, you know, our presumption of innocence
*  sort of permits this kind of gaming of the system because we want criminal defendants, obviously, to
*  try everything they can to sort of defend themselves. But if that fundamental part of
*  our criminal justice system is being leveraged, perhaps in bad faith, there's really nothing that
*  the government can do about it except go through it. That's our only choice in all of this.
*  Well, Alan, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Well, thank you, Michael.
*  This week, Trump undertook multiple efforts to delay the one criminal trial scheduled to begin
*  before the election, the hush money case. One of those efforts filed on Wednesday involved Trump
*  directly suing the judge overseeing the trial. So far, none of the delay tactics have succeeded,
*  and the trial is scheduled to begin on Monday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, the government said that inflation
*  rose in March, potentially undermining the case for reducing the country's high interest rate,
*  as many, including President Biden, have pushed for. The Consumer Price Index, a measure of prices
*  across the economy, rose 3.5 percent in March compared with a year ago, a higher number than
*  economists had forecast. So how concerned are you about the fight against inflation stalling? And do
*  you stand by your prediction for a rate cut? Well, I do stand by my prediction that before
*  the year is out to be a rate cut. During a news conference at the White House, Biden said he
*  remained confident that the Federal Reserve would soon reduce interest rates, and he defended his
*  administration's overall record on inflation. We have dramatically reduced inflation from 9 percent
*  down close to 3 percent. We're in a situation where we're better situated than we were when we
*  took office, where inflation skyrocketed. Today's episode was produced by Mary Wilson,
