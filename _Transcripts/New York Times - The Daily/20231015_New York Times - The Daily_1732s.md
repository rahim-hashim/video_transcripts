# The Sunday Read: ‘Is Måneskin the Last Rock Band?’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNFa2GWKkwM)
*  Cantano e Maneskin.
*  I'm Dan Brooks and I'm a contributor to the New York Times Magazine.
*  This week's Sunday Read is a story I wrote for the magazine about Maneskin.
*  They're a band of four very good-looking Italians in their early 20s who play throwback
*  hard rock music.
*  They sound like a lot of bands from the post-emo era.
*  It's this super competent execution of familiar elements and structures that evoke 2000s rock
*  with what I call an unswung boogie rhythm.
*  So a boogie rhythm is eighth notes but swung.
*  In bands like Franz Ferdinand, The Strokes, they often use boogie rhythms but not swung,
*  played in clean time.
*  Maneskin's tracks like I Wanna Be Your Slave
*  Eurovision winning Ziti e Buoni are hugely popular in continental Europe.
*  They're the biggest international music stars from Italy since Luciano Pavarotti and they
*  got there by busking on the streets as teenagers and then going on to win a series of talent
*  shows.
*  Last month, they kicked off a big multi-venue tour of the United States with a sold-out
*  show at Madison Square Garden.
*  And what's interesting about this band is that their core fan base is not closely connected
*  to the American critical establishment at all.
*  In fact, critics kind of hate Maneskin.
*  I first heard of Maneskin through a scathing review of their most recent album, Rush, on
*  Pitchfork.
*  The article went viral after giving the record a score of 2.0 out of 10 and holding up the
*  band as an example of many generally bad trends in music.
*  The use of multi-band compression, the predictable song structures, these sometimes actively
*  stupid lyrics.
*  So when I looked them up, I was astonished to see how popular they are.
*  They currently claim 8 billion streams across various platforms.
*  As a Gen Xer who grew up in an indie rock versus mainstream rock dichotomy, I was sort
*  of like, well, this is mainstream rock.
*  But then I realized, there's not really any such thing as mainstream rock anymore.
*  The last number one rock single was Nickelback's How You Remind Me in 2001, which makes Gen
*  Z the first generation in about 70 years that has not experienced rock and roll as a form
*  of pop music.
*  Instead, Maneskin is making pop music that takes the form of rock.
*  And that's why I was so interested in writing about them.
*  So I flew out to Rome during a heatwave, and I spent many hours with Maneskin and their
*  impressively large management team.
*  I saw their sold out shows at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome and the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in
*  Milan.
*  On stage, they put on these wildly theatrical, carefully engineered performances filled with
*  pyro and erratic spotlights, all of it emphasizing the return of the big stadium rock show.
*  One of the values of that performance is to call attention to the artificial or performed
*  nature of it all.
*  Maneskin wants you to remember that you're watching a show, and it's very much a zero
*  irony presentation.
*  So here's my article, Is Maneskin the Last Rock Band?
*  Read by James Patrick Cronin.
*  The American visitor to Rome arrives with certain preconceptions that feel like stereotypes,
*  but turn out to be basically accurate.
*  There really are mopeds flying around everywhere, and traffic seems governed by the principle
*  that anyone can be replaced.
*  Breakfast is coffee and cigarettes.
*  Despite these orthopedic and nutritional hazards, everyone is better looking.
*  Not literally everyone, of course, but statistically, as if whatever selective forces that emerge
*  from urban density have had an extra hundred generations or so to work.
*  And they really do talk like that, an emphatic mix of vowels, gestures, and car horns known
*  as Italian.
*  To be scolded in this language by a driver who wants to park in the crosswalk is to realize
*  that some popular ideas are actually true.
*  Also, it is hot.
*  The triumphant return to Rome of Maneskin, arguably the only rock stars of their generation
*  and almost certainly the biggest Italian rock band of all time, coincided with a heat
*  wave across southern Europe.
*  On that Tuesday in July, the temperature hit 107 degrees.
*  The tiber looked thick, rippled in places and still in others, as if it were reducing.
*  By Thursday morning, the band's vast management team was officially concerned that the night's
*  sold-out performance at the Stadio Olimpico would be delayed.
*  When Maneskin finally took the stage around 9.30 p.m., it was still well into the 90s,
*  which was too bad because there would be pyro.
*  There was no opening act, possibly because no rock band operating at this level is within
*  10 years of Maneskin's age.
*  The guitarist, Thomas Raggi, played the riff to Don't Wanna Sleep.
*  The lights came up and 60,000 Italians screamed.
*  Damiano David, the band's singer and at age 24 its oldest member, charged out in black
*  flared trousers and a mesh top that bisected his torso diagonally, his heavy brow and
*  hyper-symmetrical features making him look like some futuristic nomad who hunted the
*  fishnet mammoth.
*  Victoria De Angelis, the bassist, wore a mini dress made from strips of leather or possibly
*  bungee cords.
*  Raggi wore non-porous pants and a black button-down he quickly discarded, while Etten Torquio
*  drummed in a vest with no shirt underneath, his hair flying.
*  For the next several minutes of alternately disciplined and frenzied noise, they sounded
*  as if Motley Crue had been cryogenically frozen, then revived in 2010 with Rob Thomas on vocals.
*  That hypothetical will appeal to some while repelling others, and which category you fall
*  into is, with all due respect, not my business here.
*  Rolling Stone, for its part, said that Monaskin only managed to confirm how hard rock and
*  roll has to work these days to be noticed, and a viral Pitchfork review called their
*  most recent album absolutely terrible at every conceivable level.
*  But this kind of thumbs up, thumbs down criticism is pretty much vestigial now that music is
*  free.
*  If you want to know whether you like Monaskin, the name is Danish, you can fire up the internet
*  and add to the more than 9 billion streams Sony Music claims the band has accumulated
*  across Spotify, YouTube, etc.
*  As for whether Monaskin is good, degustibus non est disputatum, as previous Italians once
*  said, in matters of taste, there can be no arguments.
*  You should know, though, that even though their music has been heard most often through
*  phone and laptop speakers, Monaskin sounds better on a soccer field.
*  That is what tens of thousands of fans came to the Stadio Olimpico on an eyelid-scorching
*  Thursday to experience, the culturally, if not personally familiar commodity of a stadium
*  rock show delivered by the unprecedented phenomenon of a stadium-level Italian rock band.
*  The Pyro, 20-foot jets of swivel articulated flame that you could feel all the way up in
*  the mezzanine, kicked in on gasoline, a song Monaskin wrote to protest Vladimir Putin's
*  invasion of Ukraine.
*  From a thrust platform in the center of the field, David poured his full emotive powers
*  into the pre-chorus, standing alone on that hill, using your fuel to kill, we won't take
*  it standing still, watch us dance.
*  The effect these words will have on President Putin is unknown.
*  They capture something, though, about rock and roll, which has established certain conventions
*  over the last seven decades.
*  One of those conventions is an atmosphere of rebellion.
*  It doesn't have to be real, you probably don't even want it to be, but neither can it seem
*  too contrived, because the defining constraint of rock as a genre is that you have to feel
*  it.
*  The successful rock song creates in listeners the sensation of defying consensus, even if
*  they are right in step with it.
*  The need to feel the rock may explain the documented problems of fans' taste becoming
*  frozen in whatever era was happening when they were between the ages of 15 and 25.
*  Anyone who adolessed after Spotify, however, did not grow up with rock as an organically
*  developing form and is likely to have experienced the whole catalog simultaneously, listening
*  to Led Zeppelin at the same time they listened to Pixies and Franz Ferdinand, i.e. as a genre
*  rather than as particular artists, the way my generation, I'm 46, experienced jazz.
*  The members of Monoskin belong to this post-Spotify cohort.
*  As the youngest and most prominent custodians of the rock tradition, their job is to sell
*  new guitar-driven songs of 100 to 150 beats per minute to a larger and larger audience,
*  many of whom are young people who primarily think of such music as a historical artifact.
*  Starting this month, Monoskin will take this business on a multi-venue tour of the United
*  States, a market where they are considerably less known, whose first stop is Madison Square
*  Garden.
*  I think the genre thing is like, Torquio said to me backstage in Rome, making a gesture
*  that conveyed translingual complexity.
*  We can do a metaphor.
*  If you eat fish, meat and peanuts every day, like for years, and then you discover potatoes
*  one day, you'll be like, wow, potatoes, I like potatoes, potatoes are great.
*  But potatoes have been there the whole time.
*  Rock was the potato in this metaphor, and he seemed to be saying that even though many
*  people were just now discovering that they liked it, it had actually been around for
*  a long time.
*  It was a revealing analogy.
*  The implication was that rock, like the potato, is here to stay.
*  But what if rock is, like the potato in our age of abundance, comparatively bland and
*  no longer anyone's favorite?
*  Which rock song came first is a topic of disagreement, but one strong candidate is Rocket 88, recorded
*  by Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm Band in 1951.
*  It's about a car and in its final verse about drinking in the car.
*  These themes captured the context in which rock and roll emerged, a period when household
*  incomes, availability of consumer goods and the share of Americans experiencing adolescence
*  all increased simultaneously.
*  Although and possibly because rock started as black music, it found a gigantic audience
*  of white teenagers during the so-called British invasion of the mid-1960s, the Beatles, the
*  Rolling Stones, the Who, which made it the dominant form of pop music for the next two
*  decades.
*  The stadium progressive era, Journey, Fleetwood Mac, Foreigner, that now constitutes the bulk
*  of classic rock radio, gave way eventually to punk, the Ramones, Patti Smith, Minor Threat,
*  and then glam metal, Twisted Sister, Guns N' Roses, and various other hair-intensive
*  bands that were obliterated by the success of Nirvana and Pearl Jam in 1991.
*  This shift can be understood as the ultimate triumph of punk, both in its return to emotive
*  content expressed through simpler arrangements and in its professed hostility toward the
*  music industry itself.
*  After 1991, suspicion of anything resembling pop became a mark of seriousness among both
*  rock critics and fans.
*  It is probably not a coincidence that this period is also when rock's cultural hegemony
*  began to wane.
*  As the 90s progressed, larger and again whiter audiences embraced hip-hop, and the last song
*  classified as rock to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 was Nickelback's How
*  You Remind Me in 2001.
*  The run of bands that became popular during the aughts, The Strokes, The Killers, Kings
*  of Leon, constituted rock's last great commercial gasp, but none of their singles charted higher
*  than number four.
*  Let us say then that the era of rock as pop music lasted from 1951 to 2011.
*  That's a three-generation run.
*  If you take seriously rock's advice to get drunk and have sex in the car and therefore
*  produce children at around age 20, baby boomers were the generation that made rock a zillion-dollar
*  Gen X saved it from that industry with punk and indie, and millennials closed it all out
*  playing Guitar Hero.
*  The members of Monoskin are between the ages of 22 and 24, situating them firmly within
*  the cadre of people who understand rock in the past tense.
*  The Angelus, the bassist, and Raji, the guitarist, formed the band when they were both attending
*  a music-oriented middle school.
*  David was a friend of friends, while Torquio was the only person who responded to their
*  Facebook ad seeking a drummer.
*  There are few entry-level rock venues in Rome, so they started by busking on the streets.
*  In 2017, they entered the cattle-call audition for the Italian version of the X Factor.
*  They eventually finished as runners-up to the balladier Lorenzo Licitra, and an EP of
*  songs they performed on the show was released by Sony Music and went triple platinum.
*  In 2021, Monoskin won the San Remo Music Festival, earning the right to represent Italy with
*  their song Zitti e Buoni, whose title roughly translates to Shut Up and Behave, in that
*  year's Eurovision Song Contest.
*  This program is not widely viewed in the United States, but it is a gigantic deal in Europe.
*  And Monoskin won.
*  Not long after, they began to appear on international singles charts, and I Wanna Be Your Slave
*  broke the British top ten.
*  A European tour followed, as well as US appearances at festivals and historic venues.
*  This ascent to stardom was not unmarred by controversy.
*  The Eurovision live broadcast caught David bending over a table offstage, and members
*  of the media accused him of snorting cocaine.
*  David insisted he was innocent and took a drug test, which he passed, but Monoskin and
*  their management still seem indignant about the whole affair.
*  It's exactly this kind of incongruous detail, this damaging rumor that a rock star did cocaine,
*  that highlights how the Italian music-consuming public differs from the American one.
*  Many elements of Monoskin's presentation, like the cross-dressing and the occasional
*  male-on-male kiss, are genuinely upsetting to older Italians, even as they seem familiar
*  or even hackneyed to audiences in the United States.
*  They see a band of young, good-looking guys that are dressing up too much and then it's
*  not pure rock and roll because you're not in a garage looking ugly, the Angelus says.
*  The more conservative side, they're shocked because of how we dress or move on stage,
*  or the boys wear makeup.
*  She and her bandmates are caught between two demographics, the relatively conservative
*  European audience that made them famous, and the more tolerant, if not downright desensitized
*  American audience that they must impress to keep the ride moving.
*  And they do have to keep it moving because, like many rock stars before them, most of
*  the band dropped out of high school to do this.
*  At one point, Raggi told me that he had sat in on some classes at a university just to
*  try to understand, what is that?
*  One question that emerged early in my discussions with Monoskin's friendly and professional
*  management team was whether I was going to say that their music was bad.
*  This concern seemed related to the aforementioned viral pitchfork review, in which the editor,
*  Jeremy Larson, wrote that their new album, Rush, sounds, like it's made for introducing
*  the all-new Ford F-150 and seems to be optimized for getting busy in a Buffalo Wild Wings bathroom,
*  en route to a score of 2.0 out of 10.
*  While the members of Monoskin seemed to take this review philosophically, their press liaisons
*  were concerned that I was coming to Italy to have a similar type of fun.
*  Here I should disclose that Larson edited an essay I wrote for Pitchfork about the Talking
*  Heads album Remain in Light, score 10.0, and that I think of myself as his friend.
*  Possibly because of these biases, I read his review as reflecting his deeply held and,
*  among rock fans, widely shared need to feel the music, something that the many pop, commercial
*  elements of Rush, e.g. familiar song structures, lyrics that seem to have emerged from a collaboration
*  between Google Translate and Nikki Sixx, compulsive use of multi-band compression, left him unable
*  to do.
*  This perspective reflects the post-90s rock consensus, PNRC, that anything that sounds
*  too much like a mass-market product is no good.
*  The PNRC is premised on the idea that rock is not just a structure of song, but also
*  a structure of relationship between the band and society.
*  From rock's earliest days as black music, the real or perceived opposition between rocker
*  and society has been central to its appeal.
*  This adversarial relationship animated the youth and counterculture eras of the 60s and
*  then, when the economic dominance of mass-market rock made it impossible to believe in, provoked
*  the revitalizing backlash of punk.
*  Even major labels felt obliged to play into this paradoxical world view, e.g. that period
*  after Nirvana when the most popular genre of music was called alternative.
*  Monoskin, however, are defined by their isolation from the PNRC.
*  They play rock music, but operate according to the logic of pop.
*  In Milan, where Monoskin would finish their Italian mini-tour, I had lunch with the band
*  as well as two of their managers, Marika Casalinuovo and Fabrizio Ferraguzzo.
*  Casalinuovo had been an executive producer working on the X-Factor, and Ferraguzzo was
*  its musical director.
*  Around the time that Monoskin broke through, Casalinuovo and Ferraguzzo left the show and
*  began working with the stars it had made.
*  We were at the in-house restaurant of Moizza, the combination recording studio, soundstage,
*  rehearsal space, offices, party venue and creative playground that Ferraguzzo opened
*  two months earlier.
*  After clarifying that he was in no way criticizing major record labels and the many vendors they
*  engaged to record, promote and distribute albums, he laid out his vision for Moizza,
*  a place where all those functions were performed by a single corporate entity, basically describing
*  the concept of vertical integration.
*  Ferraguzzo oversaw the recording of Rush, along with a group of producers that included
*  Max Martin, the Swedish hitmaker best known for his work with Backstreet Boys and Britney
*  Spears.
*  At Moizza, Ferraguzzo played for me Monoskin's then-unreleased new single, Honey, Are You
*  which features many of the band's signature moves, guitar and bass playing the same melodic
*  phrases at the same time, unswung boogie-type rhythm of the post-strokes style, but also
*  has David singing in a higher register than usual.
*  I listened to it first on studio monitors and then through the speaker of Ferraguzzo's
*  phone, and it sounded clean and well-produced both times, as if a team of industry veterans
*  with unlimited access to espresso had come together to perfect it.
*  The sheer number of older and more experienced professionals involved in Monoskin introduces
*  a tension between the rock conventions that characterize their songwriting and the fundamentally
*  pop circumstances under which those songs are produced.
*  They are four friends in a band, but that band is inside an enormous machine.
*  From their perspective though, the machine is good.
*  There's hundreds of people working and talking about you and giving opinions, DeAngelo said
*  at lunch, so if you start to get in this loop of wanting to know and control and being anxious
*  about it, it really ruins everything.
*  Here lies the conflict between what the PNRC wants from a band, resistance to outside influences,
*  contempt for commerce, authenticity as measured in doing everything themselves, and what any
*  sane 23-year-old would want, which is to have someone with an MBA make all the decisions
*  so she can concentrate on playing bass.
*  The other way Monoskin is isolated from the PNRC is geographic.
*  Over the course of lunch, it became clear that they had encyclopedic knowledge of certain
*  eras in American rock history, but were only dimly aware of others.
*  Raji, for instance, loves Motley Crue and has an album-by-album command of the Los Angeles
*  hair metal band Skid Row, which he and his bandmates seemed to understand were supposed
*  to be guilty pleasures.
*  But none of them had ever heard of Fugazi, the post-hardcore band whose hatred of major
*  labels, refusal to sell merchandise, and commitment to keeping ticket prices as low as possible
*  set the standard for a generation of American rock snobs.
*  In general, Monoskin's timeline of influences seems to break off around 1990, when the rock,
*  most respected by Anglophone critics, was produced by independent labels that did not
*  overseas distribution.
*  It picks up again with Franz Ferdinand and the emo era of mainstream pop rock.
*  This retrospect leaves them unaware of the indie, punk, DIY period that was probably
*  most important in forming the PNRC.
*  The question is whether that consensus still matters.
*  While snobs like Larson and me are overrepresented in journalism, we never constituted a majority
*  of rock fans.
*  That's the whole point of being a snob, and snobbery is obsolete anyway.
*  Digital distribution ended the correlation between how obscure your favorite band was
*  and how much effort you put into listening to them.
*  The longevity of rock and roll as a genre, meanwhile, has solidified a core audience
*  that is now between the ages of 40 and 80, rendering the fan-versus-society dimension
*  of the PNRC impossible to believe.
*  And the economics of the industry, in which streaming has reduced the profit margin on
*  recorded music and the closure of small venues has made stadiums and big auditoriums the
*  only reliable way to make money on tour, have decimated the indie model.
*  All these forces have converged to make rock, for the first time in its history, merely
*  a way of writing songs instead of a way of life.
*  Yet rock, as a cluster of signifiers, retains its power around the world.
*  In the same way everyone knows what a castle is and what it signifies, even though actual
*  castles are no longer a meaningful force in our lives, rock remains a shared language
*  of cultural expression even though it is no longer determining our friendships, turning
*  children against their parents, yelling truth at power, etc.
*  Also like a castle, a lot of people will pay good money to see a preserved historical example
*  of rock or even a convincing replica of it, especially in Europe.
*  In Milan, the temperature had dropped 20 degrees and Monaskin's show at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza,
*  commonly known as San Siro, the largest stadium in Italy, sold out that night at 60,000, was
*  threatened by thunderstorms instead of record-breaking heat.
*  Fans remained undaunted, many camped in the parking lot the night before in order to be
*  among the first to enter the stadium.
*  One of them was Tamara, an American who reported her age as 60 and a half and said she had
*  skipped a reservation to see Da Vinci's last supper in order to stay in line.
*  When you get to knocking on the door, you kind of want to do what you want, she said.
*  The threat of rain was made good at pretty much the exact moment the show began.
*  The sea of black t-shirts on the pitch became a field of multicolored ponchos and raindrops
*  were bouncing visibly off the surface of the stage.
*  David lost his footing near the end of I Wanna Be Your Slave, briefly rolling to his back,
*  while DeAngelis, who is very good at making lips parted in ecstasy-type rock faces, played
*  with her eyes turned upward to the flashing sky, like a martyr.
*  The rain stopped in time for Cool Kids, a punk-inspired song in which David affects
*  a cockney accent to sing about the vexed cultural position of rock and roll.
*  Cool Kids, they do not like rock, they only listen to trap and pop.
*  These are probably the monoskin lyrics most quoted by music journalists, although they
*  should probably be taken with a grain of salt, considering that the song also contains lyrics
*  like I like doing things I love, yeah, and Cool Kids, they do not vomit.
*  Cool Kids was the last song before the encore, and each night a few dozen good-looking twenty-somethings
*  were released onto the stage to dance, and then, as the band walked off, to make we're-not-worthy
*  bows around Raji's abandoned guitar.
*  The whole thing looked at least semi-choreographed, but management assured me that the Cool Kids
*  were not professional dancers, just enthusiastic fans who had been asked if they wanted to
*  be part of the show.
*  I kept trying to meet the person in charge of wrangling these Cool Kids, and there kept
*  being new reasons that was not possible.
*  The regular kids, on the other hand, were available and friendly throughout.
*  In Rome, Dorca and Sarah, two young members of a monoskin fan club, saw my notebook and
*  shot right over to tell me they loved the band because, as Sarah put it, they allow
*  you to be yourself.
*  When asked whether they felt their culture was conservative in ways that prevented them
*  from being themselves, Dorca, who was 21 and wearing eyeglasses that looked like part
*  of her daily wardrobe and a mesh top that didn't, said,
*  Maybe it turns out that you can be yourself, but you don't know that at first.
*  You feel like you can.
*  Here lies the element of rock that functions independently from the economics of the industry
*  or the shifting preferences of critics, the part that is maybe independent from time itself.
*  A continually renewed experience of adolescence, of hearing and therefore feeling it all for
*  the first time.
*  But how disorienting must those feelings be when they have been fully monetized, fully
*  sanctioned, when the response to your demand to rock and roll all night and party every
*  day is, great, exactly, thank you.
*  In a culture where defying consensus is the dominant value, anything is possible except
*  rebellion.
*  It must be strange, in this post-everything century, to finally become yourself and discover
*  that no one has any problem with that.
