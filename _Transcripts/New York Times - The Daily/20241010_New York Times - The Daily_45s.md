**New York Times - The Daily:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns8L9XF2kQE)
*  This was the week in the campaign for president where back-to-back natural disasters became an inescapable story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns8L9XF2kQE&t=0.0s)]
*  Hurricane Milton is turning closer to the west coast of Florida. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns8L9XF2kQE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Pamela Harris finally met the press. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns8L9XF2kQE&t=10.16s)]
*  And it was the week when Donald Trump faced new and really serious accusations of cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns8L9XF2kQE&t=15.120000000000001s)]

*  So how should we make sense of all of that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns8L9XF2kQE&t=28.96s)]
*  I brought together three of my colleagues, chief politics analyst Nate Cohn, senior political correspondent Maggie Haberman, and the host of the Times campaign podcast, The Run-Up, Astead Herndon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns8L9XF2kQE&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  I'm Michael Bobarro, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns8L9XF2kQE&t=41.92s)]
