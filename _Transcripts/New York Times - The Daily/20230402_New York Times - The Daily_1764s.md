# The Sunday Read: â€˜A Sandwich Shop, a Tent City and an American Crisis'
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NONCoUKnZlU)
*  Hi, I'm Eli Saslow, and I'm a writer at large for the New York Times.
*  For this week's Sunday Read, I'm going to be sharing a story that I wrote for the paper,
*  about a couple that has been running a sandwich shop near the Arizona State
*  Capitol in Phoenix, Arizona for 37 years.
*  And now surrounding that business is one of the largest homeless encampments in
*  the country, where on some nights, 1,100 people are sleeping outdoors in tents
*  and clapboard structures on wooden pallets in the middle of the road,
*  sometimes just face down on the sidewalk within blocks and sometimes frankly
*  within feet of their business.
*  I write about how the big issues in the country impact people's lives.
*  And I've seen homelessness increasing around the country in a lot of my
*  reporting trips and also in the city where I live in Portland, Oregon, where
*  homelessness is the number one issue for everybody here and also increasingly the
*  number one political issue for many cities across the American West.
*  So once I started thinking about that issue, I began calling business owners
*  around the country and trying to figure out where is a place that I can go to
*  not only inform people about this story, but hopefully to make them feel it, to
*  make them understand what it's like.
*  I talked to dozens of business owners.
*  I thought maybe I would go to San Jose or Sacramento or San
*  Francisco or Salt Lake City.
*  And in this canvassing of making a bunch of calls, I learned about what was
*  happening in Phoenix, where there is a homeless encampment on the edges of
*  downtown that is larger than all, but maybe one or two encampments in the country.
*  One of those calls was to Joe and Debbie.
*  And I think what immediately made their story resonate with me is that their
*  sandwich shop is not just a business.
*  It's a place they started together when they were a young couple.
*  They then expanded the little back part of this restaurant to build a nursery for
*  their kids.
*  They expanded into catering to help pay for those kids to go to state college.
*  Every part of them has been invested inside this restaurant.
*  Joe said something when I was with him that's in the story that I think
*  summarizes what I saw better than anything I could say, which is, who is this
*  working for?
*  Like us, them, inside, outside, nobody's winning.
*  I think that one of the things that I found in Phoenix, and hopefully one of the
*  things that the story shows, is a system that is broken at this point and is not
*  working for anybody.
*  So here's my article.
*  He had been coming into work at the same sandwich shop at the same exact time
*  every weekday morning for the last four decades.
*  But now Joe Fialici, 69, pulled up to old station subs with no idea what to expect.
*  He parked on a street lined with three dozen tents, grabbed his mace and unlocked
*  the door to his restaurant.
*  The peace sign was still hanging above the entryway.
*  Fake flowers remained undisturbed on every table.
*  He picked up the phone and dialed his wife and business partner, Debbie Fialici, 60.
*  All clear, he said.
*  Everything looks good.
*  You're sure?
*  No issues?
*  She asked.
*  What's going on with the neighbors?
*  He looked out the window toward Madison Street, which had become the center of
*  one of the largest homeless encampments in the country, with as many as 1100
*  people sleeping outdoors.
*  On this February morning, he could see a half dozen men pressed around a roaring
*  fire.
*  A young woman was lying in the middle of the street, wrapped beneath a
*  canvas advertising banner.
*  A man was weaving down the sidewalk in the direction of Joe's restaurant with
*  a saw, muttering to himself and then stopping to urinate a dozen feet from
*  Joe's outdoor tables.
*  It's the usual chaos and suffering, he told Debbie, but the restaurant's still
*  standing.
*  That had seemed to them like an open question each morning, but it was
*  the same as it had been each morning for the last three years, as an epidemic
*  of unsheltered homelessness began to overwhelm Phoenix and many other major
*  American downtowns.
*  Cities across the West had been transformed by a housing crisis, a
*  mental health crisis, and an opioid epidemic, all of which landed at the
*  doorsteps of small businesses already reaching a breaking point because of the
*  pandemic.
*  In Seattle, more than 2300 businesses had left downtown since the beginning of
*  2020.
*  A group of fed up small business owners in Santa Monica, California had hung a
*  banner on the city's promenade that read, Santa Monica is not safe.
*  Crime, depravity, outdoor mental asylum.
*  And in Phoenix, where the number of people living on the street had more than
*  tripled since 2016, businesses had begun hiring private security firms to guard
*  their property and lawyers to file a lawsuit against the city for failing to
*  manage, quote, a great humanitarian crisis.
*  The Fialiches had signed on to the lawsuit as plaintiffs, along with about a
*  dozen other nearby property owners.
*  They also bought an extra mop to clean up the daily flow of human waste, replaced
*  eight shattered windows with plexiglass, installed a wrought iron fence around
*  their property, and continued opening their doors at exactly eight each morning
*  to greet the first customer of the day.
*  Hey bro, the usual, Joe said to a construction worker who always ordered
*  Italian on wheat.
*  Love the new haircut, Joe said a few minutes later to a city employee who came
*  from meatballs three days each week.
*  Debbie arrived to help with the lunch rush and she greeted customers at the
*  register while Joe prepared tomato sauce and weighed out 2.2 ounces of turkey
*  for each chef's salad.
*  Their margins had always been tight, but they saved on labor costs by both going
*  into work every day.
*  They remodeled the kitchen to make room for a nursery when their children were
*  born and then expanded into catering to help those children pay for college.
*  They kept making the same nine original house sandwiches for a loyal group of
*  regulars, even as the city transformed around them.
*  It's population growing by about 25,000 each year, inflation rising faster than
*  in any other U.S.
*  city, housing costs soaring at a record pace until it seemed that there was
*  nowhere left for people to go except onto sidewalks, into tents, into broken
*  down cars and increasingly into the air conditioned relief of old station subs.
*  I need to place a huge order, a woman said as she walked up to the counter
*  wearing mismatched shoes and carrying a garbage bag of her belongings.
*  I own Dairy Queen.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Which one?
*  Debbie asked, playing along.
*  All of them, the woman said.
*  I'm queen of the queen.
*  That's wonderful, Debbie said as she led the woman to a table with a menu and a
*  glass of water and watched as the woman emptied her bag onto the table.
*  Covering it with rocks, expired bus passes, a bicycle tire, clothing, 17
*  batteries, a few needles and a flashlight.
*  Would you like me to take an order?
*  Debbie asked.
*  You know why I'm here, the woman said, suddenly banging her fist against the
*  table.
*  Don't patronize me.
*  The king needs his payment.
*  Debbie refilled the woman's water and walked behind the counter to find Joe.
*  For the past several months, she had driven into work with stomach pain and
*  stress headaches.
*  She'd started telling Joe that she was done at Old Station, whether that meant
*  selling the restaurant, boarding it up, or even moving away from Phoenix for a
*  while without him.
*  She had begun looking at real estate in Prescott, a small town about a hundred
*  miles away with a weekly art walk, mountain air, a few lakes.
*  What am I supposed to tell this lady?
*  She asked him.
*  I can't keep doing this every minute.
*  It's something Joe reached for her hand.
*  It'll get better.
*  Stick with me.
*  He said.
*  But now they could hear the woman tossing some of her belongings onto the
*  floor.
*  The king needs his ransom, she shouted.
*  I'm sorry, but it's time to go.
*  Debbie told her.
*  You thieves, you devils, the woman said.
*  Please, Debbie said, this is our business.
*  We're just trying to get through lunch.
*  Their restaurant was located a half mile from the Arizona state capital in an
*  industrial neighborhood of warehouses and crisscrossing train tracks that had
*  always attracted a small number of transients.
*  Over the years, Joe and Debbie came to know many by name and listened to their
*  stories of eviction, medical debt, mental illness, and addiction.
*  They were all very well-informed.
*  They were very well-informed.
*  They were very well-informed.
*  They were very well-informed.
*  They were very well-informed.
*  They were very well-informed.
*  They were very well-informed.
*  They were very well-informed.
*  They had given out water, opened their bathroom to the public, and cashed
*  unemployment and disability checks at no extra cost.
*  They hired a sandwich maker who was homeless and had lost his teeth
*  after years of addiction, a dishwasher who lived in the women's shelter and
*  first came to the restaurant for lunch with her parole officer, a cleaner who
*  slept a few blocks away on a wooden pallet and a
*  cleaner who slept a few blocks away on a wooden pallet and a
*  cleaner who slept a few blocks away on a wooden pallet.
*  officer, a cleaner who slept a few blocks away on a wooden pallet and washed up in the
*  bathroom before her shift.
*  But the homeless population in Phoenix continued to grow by hundreds each year, even as the
*  city's supply of shelter beds remained relatively flat, and a federal court ruling in 2018 required
*  places with no shelter capacity to allow some camping in public spaces.
*  The city's average rent rose by more than 80% during the pandemic.
*  A wave of evictions drove more people from their homes, until for the first time ever,
*  more than half of Phoenix's homeless population was finding refuge not in traditional places
*  like shelters or temporary apartments, but in cars or tents.
*  Soon there were hundreds of people sleeping within a few blocks of old station, most of
*  them suffering from mental illness or substance abuse as they lived out their private lives
*  within public view of the restaurant.
*  They slept on Joe and Debbie's outdoor tables, defecated behind their back porch, smoked
*  methamphetamine in their parking lot, washed clothes in their bathroom sink, pilfered bread
*  and gallon jars of pickles from their delivery trucks, had sex on their patio, masturbated
*  within view of their employees, and lit fires for warmth that burned down palm trees and
*  scared away customers.
*  Finally, Joe and Debbie could think of nothing else to do but to start calling their city
*  the city manager, the mayor, the governor, and the police.
*  We've got a guy outside who's naked, trespassing, and needs some serious help, Joe reported,
*  in a call to the police in the fall of 2021.
*  They're throwing rocks from across the street at our windows, he said, in another call a
*  few months later.
*  Breaking and entering, vandalism, harassment, I'm probably leaving some stuff out, he said.
*  She's swinging a pipe at people.
*  Would you consider that normal, he said?
*  It's a fire the size of my house.
*  My customers are trying to eat and they can't even breathe, he said.
*  Gunshots, shouting, it goes on all day, he said.
*  Within a half mile of their restaurant, the police had been called to an average of eight
*  incidents a day in 2022.
*  There were at least 1,097 calls for emergency medical help, 573 fights or assaults, 236
*  incidents of trespassing, 185 fires, 140 thefts, 125 armed robberies, 13 sexual assaults, and
*  four homicides.
*  The remains of a 20 to 24-week-old fetus were burned and left next to a dumpster in November.
*  Two people were stabbed to death in their tents.
*  16 others were found dead from overdoses, suicides, hypothermia, or excessive heat.
*  The city had tried to begin extensive cleaning of the encampment, but in December the American
*  Civil Liberties Union successfully filed a federal lawsuit to keep people on the street
*  from being, quote, terrorized and displaced.
*  And now Joe and Debbie arrived for work on another morning and noticed a woman sprawled
*  on the sidewalk with her face against the pavement.
*  Debbie watched for a moment until she saw the woman roll onto her side.
*  Maybe she was sick, maybe she was just asleep.
*  Let's give her a bit to get sorted, Debbie said.
*  But at lunchtime, the woman had barely moved, and two hours later she was still lying there
*  as the temperature climbed and Debbie began to imagine the worst possibilities.
*  More than 1,250 homeless people had died in Maricopa County in the last two years, including
*  hundreds from drug overdoses or heat exposure.
*  Other nearby property owners had started calling the neighborhood, Death Row.
*  Debbie picked up the phone and dialed 911.
*  I'm concerned, she said.
*  It sounds like someone who could be resting, the dispatcher told her.
*  Maybe, Debbie said, but I'm about to go home for the day.
*  Can you do a wellness check?
*  That would mean sending the fire department, and lately firefighters had been harassed
*  or assaulted so often within the encampment that they typically responded with a police
*  escort.
*  The dispatcher explained that it wasn't possible to send a full team of emergency medical workers
*  to check on every person on the street who might in fact be taking a nap.
*  And she suggested that Debbie approach the woman herself to ask if she needed help.
*  I'll stay on the line with you, the dispatcher offered.
*  Debbie stood by her car and watched the woman's chest rise and fall.
*  At least a dozen times in the last month, Debbie had been screamed at, threatened, or
*  verbally assaulted on the street by people who were suffering from severe mental illness,
*  until sometimes she felt her compassion giving way to fear and anger.
*  Fine, she said, keep doing nothing.
*  She hung up and drove home.
*  A while later, the woman got up off the sidewalk and walked to a tent across the street.
*  The woman's name was Sheena Sepulveda, and she had been living in the encampment for
*  a few weeks, or maybe for a few months.
*  It was hard to know for sure, she said, because she had been experiencing delusions.
*  What she remembered was escaping from a cult in Mesa, building the first internet search
*  engine, losing billions of dollars to a government conspiracy, cutting wiretaps out of her brain,
*  retaking her dynastic name of SB Rockefeller, and then moving onto an eight by eight foot
*  plot of sidewalk across the street from old station subs.
*  For as long as she had been homeless, she tried to nap during the relative safety of
*  the day and stay up late at night to help look over her small corner of the encampment.
*  She put on makeup and sat down at a plywood desk, where a handwritten nameplate introduced
*  her as, quote, doctor, poet, psychologist, partner at law.
*  And where in reality, she was now the 47 year old caretaker of a half dozen people, because
*  even if many of her stories were fantastical, she had earned a reputation for being generous
*  and kind and for knowing a bit about everything.
*  Hey, Espy, can you help me?
*  Brandon Mack said as he walked over from his nearby tent.
*  He lifted his shirt to reveal two stab wounds from a few days earlier.
*  He had fought with a neighbor over a coveted corner spot on the sidewalk, walked to the
*  emergency room, gotten 18 stitches, and then returned to recover on a molding mattress
*  in a partly burned tent.
*  Oh, yeah, it's infected, Espy said.
*  I saw a lot of this when I was a surgeon.
*  How do you feel?
*  I'm alive, he said.
*  This isn't a life.
*  It's an existence, Espy said, as she took out a pair of scissors, scrubbed them with
*  hand sanitizer and started to cut away a few of his stitches.
*  She wiped away the pus and blood with napkins, tossing them into the street.
*  Then she turned her attention to the next person in need of help.
*  Cecilia wanted soap, so Espy handed her a bar she had scavenged from the nearby shelter.
*  CJ was drunk and needed help getting into the street to go to the bathroom.
*  A man known as KD was moving his tent 50 yards down the sidewalk because he'd gotten into
*  an argument with a neighbor who insulted his pit bull.
*  Nobody talks down to dots, KD said.
*  I'm ready to go off.
*  I'm armed and dangerous.
*  I was a police officer, Espy told him.
*  If you really have to shoot, don't aim to kill.
*  Just fire a warning shot.
*  The sun went down and Espy saw her closest friend and neighbor, Kip Polston, 65, coming
*  back from the bus stop carrying a bucket and his 10-foot window washing pole.
*  In the last year, he had lost his business to heroin addiction, his apartment to eviction,
*  and his truck to an accident.
*  Now he was working to get clean, leaving his tent at 5.30 each morning for an appointment
*  at a methadone clinic before riding the city bus to businesses all across Maricopa County.
*  He was trying to piece his life back together one window at a time, washing each for $3.
*  He'd washed 268 windows in the last month, but he was still nowhere close to saving enough
*  for a security deposit and rent.
*  So instead, he had settled into an encampment so immense that it operated as its own separate
*  economy.
*  Blue fentanyl pills sold for $2, and anyone could trade a decent pair of shoes for a week's
*  supply of methamphetamine.
*  A group of young men in the encampment had begun selling off pieces of the public sidewalk,
*  charging each person $20 a week for what they called, quote, lot rent and security.
*  That had seemed ridiculous to Kip until he decided not to pay and then awoke one night
*  to the smell of someone dousing his tent with lighter fuel.
*  He stood on the sidewalk to brush his teeth, went into his tent, and turned on his portable
*  radio.
*  It reminded him of sleeping inside his truck, so he usually kept it playing all night.
*  Too loud, Espy?
*  He asked.
*  No, Kip, you're fine, she said.
*  He tucked his toothpaste into his backpack and noticed a small bag with the leftover
*  remnants of black tar heroin.
*  There was just enough to numb himself out so he could forget about his methadone appointment
*  and the 18 windows he was scheduled to wash the next day.
*  He held the bag in his hand for a moment, opened the zipper of his tent, and tossed
*  it outside.
*  Joe came into work the next morning and saw a bag of drugs in the road, human waste on
*  the sidewalk, a pit bull wandering the street, and blood-soaked napkins blowing toward his
*  restaurant patio, where he and Debbie were scheduled to meet with a real estate agent
*  about the future of Old Station.
*  Debbie still insisted that she was ready to be done with the restaurant.
*  Joe didn't want to run it without her, but he also didn't want to board it up and walk
*  away with nothing.
*  They had spent the past several months exploring a compromise, seeing if they could sell the
*  business and retire together.
*  Are we getting any bites?
*  Joe asked the agent, Mike Gaeta, as they sat on the patio.
*  Oh yeah, I get calls every week, Mike said.
*  And he explained that at least 25 potential buyers had looked over the financials and
*  recognized a strong family business for the reasonable price of $165,000.
*  Several bailed once Mike mentioned the encampment, but at least a dozen potential buyers secretly
*  came to Old Station to check out the property.
*  Most of the time, they don't call back, Mike said.
*  If I track them down, it's like, God bless those people for staying in business, because
*  I couldn't do it.
*  It's taken years off my life, Debbie said.
*  For her it's, get me out, we've got to sell, sell, sell, Joe said.
*  But we refused an offer for $250,000 eight years ago, and it keeps dropping.
*  I don't want to give this place away.
*  I can't afford it.
*  I get it, said Mike.
*  If you were a half mile in another direction, you'd be sitting on a million bucks.
*  Instead, it's, how can you dispose of it?
*  Joe sat with that word for a moment as he smoothed the wrinkles from his apron.
*  He had worked in restaurants since he was 15 when he started washing dishes at his father's
*  Italian diner in Montreal.
*  He'd learned how to cook and keep the books, but his father had mostly shown him that a
*  restaurant could succeed because of an owner's charisma, and Joe brought that philosophy
*  to Phoenix.
*  A lot of places could make a good ham and cheese.
*  Old Station had thrived for 37 years because of Debbie's hugs at the entryway, Joe's teasing
*  at the register, and the hand-picked signs and inside jokes that covered every inch of
*  their walls.
*  We've put all of ourselves into this place, Joe said.
*  They didn't have a pension.
*  Their plan had always been to invest in the business, sell it, and use that money to retire.
*  They weren't seeking any damages in their lawsuit, but instead were asking the city
*  to remove the encampment and find a different solution to care for its occupants.
*  Lawyers for the city had argued in court that the case should be dismissed because Phoenix
*  to go, quote, above and beyond to address the problem.
*  It had opened a new office of homeless solutions, and it was spending more than $50 million
*  on outreach programs, mental health services, and the creation of 800 more shelter beds
*  in converted hotels and refurbished shipping containers.
*  Maybe it all turns around in a few years, Joe said.
*  That's not on my timeline, Debbie said.
*  Mentally and mentally, I cannot keep waking up to this level of stress.
*  But maybe in six months, Joe started, and she shook her head and gestured across the
*  street.
*  You'll be dealing with this alone, she said.
*  It's aging you.
*  It's eating you up.
*  How much longer can you do it?
*  I don't know, he said.
*  A few days later, Joe drove four blocks through the encampment to visit the one person who
*  could always make him feel better about the state of the neighborhood.
*  Joel Coplin, 68, owned a building that was now surrounded by more than 55 tents, and
*  yet he continued to run an art gallery downstairs and live with his wife upstairs.
*  He never seemed to run out of hope or compassion or patience, and that's what Joe thought
*  he needed.
*  Meet the luckiest dog in the world, Joel said to Joe, introducing him to a stray puppy that
*  he'd adopted after its owner overdosed in the encampment.
*  She'd been tied up and barking for days when I found her.
*  You've got a good heart, buddy, Joe said.
*  Me, maybe not so much anymore.
*  I've got a bleeding heart, Joel said, inviting him inside.
*  The gallery had been named the best new art space in Phoenix when it opened in 2019, but
*  But lately, Joel could barely persuade a dozen people to come into the neighborhood for a
*  weekend opening, so he decided to turn his attention to the bigger problems outside.
*  He'd lived for a while in an abandoned building in Hell's Kitchen when he was an art student
*  in New York, and he knew what it was like to be homeless.
*  He began inviting some of his neighbors into the gallery, offering them food and firewood,
*  paying for some of their medical bills and sometimes painting their portraits as he listened
*  to their stories.
*  He had tried to help Sterling, who sang prayers in Apache over his meals at the soup kitchen
*  and lived for a while in the bed of Joel's truck, and Rosie, a grandmother and a heroin
*  addict who was always asking Joel for, quote, one last five, which he kept giving to her,
*  and Jennifer, a prostitute in the encampment whom he allowed to use his bathroom until
*  she started bringing guests with her.
*  He banned her from the restroom despite her pleading, and a few nights later she was arrested
*  a block away for public urination.
*  That charge triggered a warrant for another previous offense, which meant she was now
*  serving four years in prison, and Joel was putting $80 each month onto her commissary
*  card to help assuage his guilt.
*  And then there was Keisha, barely out of her teens, who had skittered around the encampment
*  like a scared cat, wary of everyone, carrying a few old dolls and crying sometimes.
*  Joel had tried to watch out for her, offering her water or a few minutes inside whenever
*  she was upset.
*  But one weekend when he wasn't around, the temperature was 115 degrees, and she laid
*  down on the curb near his gallery and died of heat exposure and dehydration.
*  Not a lot of happy endings here these days, Joel said.
*  He took out his phone, handed it to Joel, and hit play on a video that he had recorded
*  a few nights earlier from the window of his upstairs apartment.
*  There were 26 broken streetlights in the encampment because of vandalism and wire theft,
*  so the video was dark except for the reflection of police lights, which illuminated one man
*  being handcuffed and another lying dead on the ground.
*  My wife and I were relaxing after dinner, all fat and happy, and then it was, bap bap
*  bap bap bap, Joel said.
*  Did you hit the floor, Joel asked?
*  Well, yeah.
*  We have our castle dark and our fortress strong, but it's becoming crazy.
*  Our fence got cut the other night and there was a woman in our yard screaming and yelling
*  her head off in Spanish.
*  Joel handed back the phone and shook his head.
*  I'm realizing here lately that we're living in a frigging hellhole, he said.
*  Us, them, inside, outside.
*  Who's it working for?
*  When does it stop?
*  Not yet, Joel said.
*  He explained that he had heard rumors from within the encampment that there would be
*  more gunfire because of a turf battle over pieces of the sidewalk.
*  Joel had already called to warn the police, and now he suggested that Joel leave the neighborhood
*  before dark.
*  It's hard to believe, but they're telling me it will get worse, he said.
*  Joel arrived for work early the next morning to the sound of a gunshot coming from across
*  the street and a bullet pinging off a nearby fence.
*  He hurried inside the restaurant and locked the door behind him.
*  He crouched low beneath the windows and called the police.
*  Yeah, it's Joel again over at Old Station, he said.
*  And a few minutes later, two police officers were walking the perimeter of his restaurant
*  with flashlights in the predawn darkness, searching for the bullet.
*  Joel ran cold water over his hands, changed into his apron, and tried to focus on the
*  day ahead.
*  Fresh fruit cup on special, he wrote on the chalkboard, and then he started preparing
*  fruit cups as he looked outside and watched the encampment stir to life as if it were
*  just any other morning.
*  Espy set up her desk on the corner.
*  Kip came out of his tent and started assembling his window washing pole.
*  The police drove through the area and left without making any arrests.
*  KD came out of his tent with his pit bull and started pacing the sidewalk, screaming
*  to himself, waving his arms in the air and narrating the events of the previous night
*  for everyone to hear.
*  Y'all made me go psychotic, he yelled as Joe stirred his tomato sauce.
*  You come at me with a nine millimeter, then I'm pulling out my 45, KD said as Joe weighed
*  the turkey.
*  Next time, there won't be no warning shot, KD shouted as Joe unlocked the door for the
*  first customer of the morning and looked up at the clock.
*  It was just after 8 a.m.
*  By now, Debbie would be waking up and getting ready for work.
*  Soon she would be pulling into the parking lot to help handle the lunch rush.
*  What the heck am I going to tell her to keep her from losing it, Joe wondered as he began
*  to rehearse the possibilities in his head.
*  It was only one bullet.
*  Nobody had gotten hurt.
*  The police had come right away.
*  The shooter wasn't targeting the restaurant.
*  The gunshot was random.
*  It could have happened anywhere.
*  Joe poured tomato sauce over the meatballs and went outside to get some air.
*  KD was still ranting on the sidewalk, banging his hand against the fence,
*  contorting his fingers into the shape of a gun, and then firing it off at the sky.
*  This could be the last straw for her, Joe said.
*  And then he saw Debbie driving toward the parking lot, steering around KD and hurrying
*  through the gate.
*  Wow, tough morning, she asked.
*  He took her inside the restaurant while he tried to come up with the right words.
*  It was only one shot.
*  The restaurant was still standing.
*  They'd run Old Station together for 37 years, and maybe they could hang on for a while longer.
*  But instead, Joe put his hand on her shoulder and told her the only thing that felt true.
*  The whole thing's a disaster, he said.
*  I get it.
*  It's okay.
*  I understand why you're done.
