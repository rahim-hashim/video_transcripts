# An Assassination in Minnesota and a Growing War Between Israel and Iran
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=0.0s)]
*  During a dark and tumultuous weekend, two shootings in Minnesota left one lawmaker dead [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=14.16s)]
*  and another seriously injured. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  While overseas, Israel and Iran traded devastating strikes back and forth in what some fear is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=22.84s)]
*  a new phase of violence in the Middle East. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=28.8s)]
*  Today, my colleagues Ernesto Lindoño on what we know about the violence in Minnesota and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=32.4s)]
*  Farnas Fasihi on what now appears to be an all-out war between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=39.6s)]
*  It's Monday, June 16. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=56.68s)]
*  Ernesto, thank you so much for making time for us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=61.68s)]
*  I'm sure it's been a very hectic and probably quite stressful few days for the people of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Minnesota where you are. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=74.24s)]
*  That's where there's been a manhunt for the person who was alleged to have shot two lawmakers [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=76.56s)]
*  and was just taken into custody last night. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  But he still haven't released many details about him or the details surrounding his arrest. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=85.48s)]
*  I'd like you to take us to the beginning of the story and tell us what actually happened [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  in Minnesota over the weekend. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=96.16s)]
*  Yeah, in the early hours of Saturday, the police got a call about a shooting at a house [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=98.56s)]
*  in a suburb of Minneapolis, Champlain. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  And when they got there, they soon realized that a state senator, John Hoffman, and his [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=108.38000000000001s)]
*  wife had been shot at approximately two in the morning. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=114.2s)]
*  So police are very alarmed by this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=118.16s)]
*  And as a proactive measure, they decide to go check on the residence of another lawmaker, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=120.96s)]
*  the former Speaker of the House, Melissa Hortman, who lived not far away. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=127.12s)]
*  And that is where police say they ran into the shooter, a gunman, as he was about to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=133.88s)]
*  enter the house. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=141.54s)]
*  So there was an exchange of gunfire with police. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=143.12s)]
*  The gunman manages to get into the home and he guns down the lawmaker, Mrs. Hortman, and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=146.74s)]
*  her husband, Mark, in their residence. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=154.04s)]
*  While the police are outside. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=157.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=159.28s)]
*  And unfortunately, Representative Hortman and her husband, Mark, died. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=160.28s)]
*  But the senator made it out alive and he and his wife are in a hospital recovering. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=165.22s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=171.12s)]
*  In the chaos that followed the second shooting, the gunman was able to escape. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=172.76s)]
*  And what do we know about the gunman at this point? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=177.88s)]
*  So we know that he had an SUV, a vehicle that was outfitted to look exactly like a police [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=182.76s)]
*  vehicle. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=189.24s)]
*  We also know that he apparently was wearing a uniform and body armor that would lead a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=190.24s)]
*  bystander to think he was actually a law enforcement official. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=195.28s)]
*  So he was pretending to be a cop, basically, is what the thinking was. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=200.24s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  And then hours later, law enforcement officials identified the suspect as Vance Bolter, a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  57-year-old man. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=211.12s)]
*  And what have we been able to find out about this man's background? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=213.08s)]
*  We know he was a businessman with a career that had a number of acts. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=216.06s)]
*  Recently he had been in the process of establishing a private security company, but he was apparently [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=221.24s)]
*  also working for a funeral home. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=226.58s)]
*  And his job there was to collect bodies from the morgue. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=229.22s)]
*  We know he had a primary residence about an hour away from the Minneapolis area where [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=233.62s)]
*  he lived with his wife and his children. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=238.14s)]
*  But more recently, he had been renting a room in a house in Minneapolis alongside a longtime [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=241.58s)]
*  friend, David Carlson, a man who I interviewed yesterday who described himself as this guy's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=247.94s)]
*  best friend dating back to fourth grade. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=254.78s)]
*  He's a friend I knew for 50 years. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=257.34s)]
*  You knew him for 50 years? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=260.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  Since fourth grade. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  What did the man say to you? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  Well Carlson told me that his friend had been in somewhat of a downward spiral. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=266.78s)]
*  I can't believe this is all, it all happened. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=271.42s)]
*  I think he was just mental health. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=275.42s)]
*  He had been struggling financially and he had been struggling emotionally. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=279.18s)]
*  When was the last time you saw him? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=283.7s)]
*  Yeah, yesterday. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=285.7s)]
*  How did he seem at the time? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=287.14s)]
*  Well, he paid for four months of rent in advance. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=289.14s)]
*  He said that quite out of character, he had given him four months worth of rent on Friday [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  night. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=302.58s)]
*  And he said that on Friday night he went to bed early and said he just needed to get some [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=303.58s)]
*  rest. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=308.06s)]
*  However, on Saturday morning around 6 a.m. Carlson said he got a text message from this [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=309.54s)]
*  guy that really alarmed him. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=316.22s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just going to read it so you guys can kind of understand what he was thinking. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=318.1s)]
*  David and Ron, I love you guys. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=324.9s)]
*  I made some choices and you guys don't know anything about this, but I'm going to be gone [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=327.14s)]
*  for a while. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=333.14s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=340.06s)]
*  Take your time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=342.06s)]
*  Maybe dead shortly. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=344.06s)]
*  The text message said, in effect, that he may not be alive for long. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=347.82s)]
*  I don't want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don't know [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=353.58s)]
*  anything about this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=362.18s)]
*  Wow, that must have been very alarming to receive. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=364.18s)]
*  Yeah, he was terrified. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=367.46s)]
*  He told me that he called the police instantly after getting this text message, even though [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=369.7s)]
*  he didn't quite know what it meant. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=373.82s)]
*  And within hours, the police arrived with a SWAT team and they knocked the door open [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=376.7s)]
*  and clearly they were wondering if this is where the gunman had come to hide after the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=383.18s)]
*  shootings. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  Did David Carlson say anything about why Bolter was renting a room in this place when he [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=390.7s)]
*  clearly had a house somewhere else with his family? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=397.38s)]
*  Yeah, he told me it was simply a matter of convenience because working for the funeral [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=399.74s)]
*  home, he oftentimes had to be available on short notice, oftentimes very late at night. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=404.18s)]
*  So it's just easier to rent a small room in this house that was shared among a handful [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=409.1s)]
*  of adults. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=413.94s)]
*  Ernesto, I know that the investigation is still ongoing, but what can you tell us about [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=414.94s)]
*  Bolter's motivation? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=421.21999999999997s)]
*  Law enforcement officials said that in his vehicle, which he left behind at the second [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=424.18s)]
*  shooting, they found several documents. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=429.02s)]
*  They were described as a target list that included some 70 names. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=432.38s)]
*  These names were a combination of elected officials as well as individuals affiliated [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=437.82s)]
*  with abortion in some way, shape or form. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  This included abortion providers, for instance. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=446.64s)]
*  One law enforcement official called this a manifesto, but so far we haven't really been [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=449.5s)]
*  given a glimpse into his ideology. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=453.82s)]
*  We haven't really been provided with a clear rationale of what he saw to accomplish [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=456.26s)]
*  with these shootings. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=461.73999999999995s)]
*  I hear you that the police have not released the manifesto. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=463.94s)]
*  They haven't given a detailed report about what they believe Bolter's motivations to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  be. But his targets do, from what we know so far, seem to be mostly Democrats and abortion [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=470.82s)]
*  providers. So it sounds like there's a decent chance that there was some kind of political [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=476.73999999999995s)]
*  motivation here, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=480.29999999999995s)]
*  Do we know anything about Bolter's politics? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=481.82s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=483.7s)]
*  Yeah, well, the roommate told me that he voted for President Trump last year and described [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=485.34000000000003s)]
*  him as a very strong Trump supporter. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=489.82s)]
*  On the question of abortion, he said that his friend was adamantly opposed to abortion, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=492.7s)]
*  that as a devout Christian, he considered abortion murder. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=499.5s)]
*  One thing we know is he had been appointed by a previous governor to a state board that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=504.22s)]
*  includes dozens of local business people. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=509.74s)]
*  And one curious thing about this board is that one of the members was Senator John [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=513.26s)]
*  Hoffman, one of his targets. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=518.58s)]
*  So they may have crossed paths. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=520.42s)]
*  But this board was described to me as a collection of people that advise state officials [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=522.78s)]
*  on different issues affecting the economy and the workforce. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=528.1s)]
*  And it's not entirely clear to me just how closely he would have overlapped or worked [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=533.14s)]
*  with Senator Hoffman. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=538.9s)]
*  Right. We don't actually know whether they interacted, whether they got along. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=540.78s)]
*  We just know that they were both on this board together. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=544.9399999999999s)]
*  That's right. Ernesto, it's hard to take these shootings in isolation, just given what [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=547.4599999999999s)]
*  else has happened in the country over the weekend. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=552.98s)]
*  We see in Minnesota this possibly politically motivated attack against Democrats, while [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=555.78s)]
*  across the country, there are hundreds of thousands of people marching in this anti-Trump [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=561.6999999999999s)]
*  protest on the day that the president is hosting a military parade in Washington, D.C. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=566.9s)]
*  And I just wonder whether you feel like there is any connection here between the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=574.1s)]
*  shootings in Minnesota and what we are seeing around the country. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=580.14s)]
*  We don't have any hard evidence that the shooter wanted to time this alongside the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=585.06s)]
*  military parade or the protests. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=589.3s)]
*  But we do know that the protests were on his mind because the authorities said on [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=591.02s)]
*  Saturday that they found papers in his vehicle that made a reference to no kings, which [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=596.46s)]
*  was the theme of many of the protests in the country. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=602.34s)]
*  And that led Governor Tim Walz to urge people not to go out to protest, because at the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  time there was an active manhunt and many elected officials and people who were on this [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=613.38s)]
*  target list were worried about whether they were next. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=619.1s)]
*  It also feels hard to ignore the fact that these shootings seem to be the latest in a [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=622.5s)]
*  string of political violence in this country. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=626.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=629.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, we all remember that there were two assassination attempts targeting President [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=630.82s)]
*  Trump during the campaign. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=635.34s)]
*  The governor of Pennsylvania was the target of arson in his home while he was sleeping. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=637.86s)]
*  There was the attack on former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband in his residence. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=643.5s)]
*  So unfortunately, this has become incredibly common in our political era. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=648.86s)]
*  But this incident stands apart in that the gunman was able to execute an influential [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=654.98s)]
*  member of the state legislature. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=662.06s)]
*  Now, on Saturday, while Minnesotans were absorbing this disturbing and shocking news [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=669.1s)]
*  and authorities were scrambling to find the whereabouts of the gunman, the governor told [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=674.98s)]
*  people, please don't go to the rallies. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=680.0200000000001s)]
*  Today is too dangerous a day to be out protesting. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=683.1s)]
*  I went to the Capitol just to see how many people would turn out and ignore that advice. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=687.58s)]
*  Hi, everybody. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=693.98s)]
*  And to my astonishment, there were thousands of people there. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=698.7s)]
*  I just wanted to check in real quick and let you know that we are still holding this rally [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=703.1s)]
*  today. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=709.98s)]
*  Many had changed the signs that they had initially made to turn out at this protest. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=714.14s)]
*  And the new signs were honoring these lawmakers and saying, you know, they had the courage [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=718.98s)]
*  to do the difficult work of being a politician in this era. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=724.42s)]
*  Tell me why it felt important to come here despite the violence this morning. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=727.54s)]
*  I felt it was more important to come because of the violence this morning. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=732.18s)]
*  And we need to show courage on a day like today by standing outside, by standing firm [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=736.54s)]
*  in support of democracy. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=744.9s)]
*  Ernesto, thank you so much. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=750.0999999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=752.02s)]
*  After the break, I talked to Farnas Farsihi about the war between Israel and Iran. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=752.9s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=766.74s)]
*  So, Farnas, we are coming to you today because you cover Iran for the Times. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=774.5s)]
*  And late last week, we saw a massive attack by Israel on Iran. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=779.74s)]
*  Can you walk us through what specifically has been happening? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=784.94s)]
*  So, early hours of Friday morning, Israel launched a massive military strike, an attack [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=788.7s)]
*  on Iranian targets. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=795.74s)]
*  The magnitude of these attacks are on a completely different scale to what we saw. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=797.34s)]
*  Killing dozens of top military officials and scientists, along with civilians. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=801.1800000000001s)]
*  Among the targets, the chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Hossein Salami, has been [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=806.3s)]
*  killed, according to Israel. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=811.0999999999999s)]
*  Israel says they targeted Iran's nuclear program, claiming it was their very survival that was [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=812.54s)]
*  at stake. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=817.3399999999999s)]
*  In response, within several hours... [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=817.9s)]
*  Overnight, Iran's retaliation, missiles raining down on Tel Aviv. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=820.4599999999999s)]
*  Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=824.62s)]
*  All across the country, people are listening to the sound of Israel and Iran at war. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=828.38s)]
*  And this was the start of what is now Israel and Iran exchanging attacks. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=834.78s)]
*  And with each wave, those attacks are getting more intense. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=841.02s)]
*  The casualties are increasing. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=845.4200000000001s)]
*  It's escalated extremely quickly. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=847.98s)]
*  Israel's defense minister is warning that Tehran will burn if Iran continues to fire [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=850.38s)]
*  missiles towards Israel. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=856.22s)]
*  The new waves of attacks between Israel and Iran, the deaths and destruction mounting on [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=857.6600000000001s)]
*  both sides. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=862.7s)]
*  And today's scheduled negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, also a casualty. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=863.42s)]
*  And what was really striking was how unprepared Iran had been during the first wave of these [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=868.78s)]
*  attacks on Friday. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=875.8199999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by the fact that Iran was so unprepared? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=877.5799999999999s)]
*  What have you found in your reporting about why they were so caught off guard? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=880.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, Rachel, they had thought and prepared for a potential Israeli attack on [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=884.14s)]
*  their nuclear facilities because this chatter had been going on that if nuclear negotiations [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=889.34s)]
*  with President Trump fail, Israel might attack. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=894.94s)]
*  But Iran thought that Israel would not attack as long as these negotiations were ongoing [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=898.38s)]
*  with Washington. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=903.98s)]
*  And Iranian officials and American officials were scheduled to meet in Oman for a sixth [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=905.34s)]
*  round of nuclear talks on Sunday. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=910.46s)]
*  And so on Thursday, reports emerged that Israel was planning an imminent strike on Iran's [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=913.82s)]
*  nuclear facilities. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=919.74s)]
*  And then the United States was pulling out some of its non-essential staff from its embassies [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=921.66s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=927.74s)]
*  And even then, Iranian officials I was speaking to were being very dismissive and saying these [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=929.42s)]
*  are propaganda tactics and pressure diplomacy to get Iran to make concessions when it meets [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=935.66s)]
*  the United States the following Sunday for nuclear talks. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=942.7800000000001s)]
*  And then several hours later, the strikes arrived. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=947.1s)]
*  And obviously, the assumption that the Israelis would not attack turned out to be a very big [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=950.62s)]
*  miscalculation. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=955.5s)]
*  It was a very strategic mistake, Rachel. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=956.94s)]
*  They ignored some of their own precautionary practices. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=959.34s)]
*  You know, military commanders were not in bunkers. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=963.6600000000001s)]
*  They were sleeping in their own homes when they were attacked. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=966.94s)]
*  And there was a directive for senior commanders not to gather in one place, not to congregate [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=970.2199999999999s)]
*  in one place. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=976.6999999999999s)]
*  And that was ignored. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=977.5799999999999s)]
*  And one of the strikes that took out the commander in chief of the Revolutionary Guards [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=978.86s)]
*  Aerospace, he was holding a meeting with some of his senior team members, and that meeting [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=983.98s)]
*  was struck. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=989.9s)]
*  So Iranian officials were really shocked by not just the scope of the attacks, but also [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=991.18s)]
*  the security breach and the intelligence breach because this attack was multi-pronged. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=998.14s)]
*  Their intelligence failed to pick up that Israeli attacks were coming at them. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1003.58s)]
*  They also missed Israeli operatives entering Iran, smuggling missile parts and drone parts, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1009.74s)]
*  where on the night of the attack, there were airstrikes, but there were also attacks being [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1016.6999999999999s)]
*  launched from inside Iran at military bases and at various sites with the operatives [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1021.82s)]
*  inside the country. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1029.1000000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1030.14s)]
*  So in addition to feeling that they were caught off guard, they're also reckoning with, you [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1030.54s)]
*  know, their intelligence and security falling short. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1037.5800000000002s)]
*  I saw some text messages from government officials that were shared with me asking, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1040.54s)]
*  where is our air defense? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1046.8600000000001s)]
*  How can Israel just come and attack whatever it wants, kill whoever it wants, and we're [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1048.54s)]
*  not able to defend ourselves? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1054.54s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1056.1399999999999s)]
*  So they were really, really caught off guard and expressing that to each other. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1056.3799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1060.22s)]
*  The word that I heard the day after when I reached out to some of the officials I know [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1060.86s)]
*  was, we are in shock. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1066.46s)]
*  How badly damaged is Iran by all of this? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1068.94s)]
*  There's the damage on the regime and the military command. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1072.94s)]
*  It killed Iran's top chain of command, at least six senior military commanders, including [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1078.38s)]
*  the commander in chief of the armed forces and the commander in chief of the revolutionary [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1085.3400000000001s)]
*  guards. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1089.98s)]
*  It also struck some of Iran's air defense in not just the capital Tehran, but in multiple [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1091.26s)]
*  other key cities. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1097.42s)]
*  And it badly damaged the Natanz nuclear site, at least the part that is above ground. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1098.94s)]
*  Although our reporting suggests that Iran's nuclear abilities remain intact, but there's [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1105.66s)]
*  also extensive damage to civilian areas, right? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1111.3400000000001s)]
*  Israel says that it's targeting commanders and nuclear scientists, but they're striking [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1115.1000000000001s)]
*  their homes and their residential buildings. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1121.42s)]
*  And some of these office buildings that belong to, say, Ministry of Oil. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1124.3000000000002s)]
*  Iranians are terrified, Rachel. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1129.5800000000002s)]
*  They've never seen a war like this. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1131.66s)]
*  All night they're hearing massive sounds of explosions and air defense and some of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1134.7s)]
*  the bombs and missiles are landing on apartment buildings in densely populated residential [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1140.78s)]
*  areas. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1147.1000000000001s)]
*  So, given how much damage was just dealt to Iran, how was the Iranian government thinking [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1147.58s)]
*  about how it would respond to the attacks? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1175.1s)]
*  Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, immediately pledged revenge and fierce retaliation [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1177.6599999999999s)]
*  on Israel. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1184.9399999999998s)]
*  He held a meeting with the National Security Council. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1186.3799999999999s)]
*  In that meeting, sources told me that there was a debate about the risks involved for [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1190.06s)]
*  Iran going to war with Israel. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1196.3799999999999s)]
*  Mr. Khamenei faced if he didn't respond to this massive attack on Iran's sovereignty [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1199.02s)]
*  or on his regime and senior command chain, he would be seen as weak and it would be [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1206.62s)]
*  interpreted as defeat and surrender. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1212.6999999999998s)]
*  And if he did go to war and attacked, it would inevitably invite more attacks from Israel. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1215.82s)]
*  And Iran was initially planning to strike Israel with a thousand ballistic missiles [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1222.2199999999998s)]
*  in the first round of attack, but a lot of its missile bases were damaged. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1228.62s)]
*  So, we ultimately saw that Iran launched about a hundred ballistic missiles at Israel. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1233.82s)]
*  And obviously, Iran's strikes on Israel have only continued through the weekend. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1240.62s)]
*  What do we know about the damage that those strikes have caused within Israel? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1244.86s)]
*  Iran's attack has caused damages in Israel. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1249.74s)]
*  Some of those ballistic missiles have landed in the middle of residential neighborhoods. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1252.06s)]
*  They've struck apartment buildings and a defense ministry building. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1256.7s)]
*  There's been scenes of sort of carnage and chaos and civilians dead and injured in Israel. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1261.58s)]
*  But the extent of the damages to Israel's military and Israel's command and government [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1268.22s)]
*  is not the same as the extent of damages to Iran's government because Iran just doesn't [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1274.22s)]
*  have the same air defense capabilities as Israel. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1279.74s)]
*  They don't have the Iron Dome, for instance. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1283.82s)]
*  They don't have the Iron Dome. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1286.3s)]
*  Iran is really relying for both offense and defense on ballistic missiles, really. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1288.3799999999999s)]
*  I want to go back to Israel for a moment. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1294.54s)]
*  What was Israel's stated reason for this attack to begin with? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1297.02s)]
*  Israel said that Iran was advancing its nuclear program, that it didn't believe that it was going [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1301.34s)]
*  to reach a deal with the United States where it would give up enriching uranium [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1307.98s)]
*  or closing down its nuclear program. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1312.86s)]
*  And more importantly, Mr. Netanyahu had been saying for many months that Iran is weaker [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1315.5s)]
*  than it has ever been. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1322.78s)]
*  And if there's a moment to strike at the regime and weaken its defense and eradicate [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1323.8200000000002s)]
*  its advanced nuclear program, this is it because its proxy militant groups in the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1329.3400000000001s)]
*  region have been decimated or really weakened. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1334.94s)]
*  The regime is struggling financially at home because of the sanctions. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1337.9s)]
*  There's dissent inside the country with a lot of people angry at the government. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1342.86s)]
*  So Iran was having a lot of domestic challenges. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1347.9799999999998s)]
*  And Mr. Netanyahu had said that its nuclear program was advancing dangerously. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1351.1s)]
*  But we know that Iran was very seriously engaging with the United States to reach a [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1357.5s)]
*  diplomatic deal for the nuclear program. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1362.62s)]
*  And there was a chance that there would have been a breakthrough if they had continued. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1365.74s)]
*  We know that Iran has advanced its nuclear program. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1370.38s)]
*  The UN's atomic agency, the IAEA, has said in its reports that Iran has enough [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1374.0600000000002s)]
*  enriched uranium fuel for making 10 bombs if it chose to weaponize its program. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1381.5800000000002s)]
*  But at the same time, the IAEA has said that we haven't seen any evidence that Iran has [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1388.6200000000001s)]
*  made that decision or it was secretly trying to weaponize. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1394.7800000000002s)]
*  And even if Iran made that decision, it would take about a year for them to actually be [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1398.86s)]
*  able to build nuclear warheads and a bomb. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1404.78s)]
*  But as you said earlier, there had been nuclear talks planned between the U.S. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1407.8999999999999s)]
*  and Iran for Sunday. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1411.5s)]
*  What did the U.S. actually know about Israel's plans to attack Iran ahead of those talks? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1413.5s)]
*  So President Trump has said that Mr. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1419.8999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu informed him that Israel planned to strike Iran, but that the U.S. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1422.3799999999999s)]
*  was not involved in those strikes and had not taken part in the attacks. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1427.9s)]
*  The Iranians have made most of their pledges of retaliation against Israel, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1433.18s)]
*  but Iranian officials have also said that even though the U.S. claims it wasn't involved in the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1437.9s)]
*  attack, they are complicit because the United States arms Israel. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1443.5800000000002s)]
*  It is its number one backer in the world. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1449.1000000000001s)]
*  And after the attacks, it has stood by Israel and supported them. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1451.5800000000002s)]
*  Farnas, clearly we know what Netanyahu has said about the stated reasons for these attacks, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1455.74s)]
*  but we also know from your description that the attacks so far have gone beyond [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1460.14s)]
*  just hitting nuclear facilities. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1464.7s)]
*  And so I'm just wondering, based on the way the attack has unfolded, if it could be about [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1466.54s)]
*  issues just beyond Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1471.34s)]
*  Israel has significantly escalated the scope of its targets since Saturday [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1475.18s)]
*  by attacking energy infrastructure. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1482.3s)]
*  And to ordinary Iranians and the Iranian government, this suggests that part of the [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1485.98s)]
*  motivation maybe for this war is to make Iran a weak state, is to create chaos and to really [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1492.7s)]
*  cripple the government's ability to access oil resources and income. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1501.26s)]
*  And that could really have an effect on people's lives. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1506.94s)]
*  What are the concerns right now inside of Iran about how this is likely to progress? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1511.02s)]
*  I think the scariest thing for Iranians is that right now nobody knows where this is going, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1517.34s)]
*  how long this war is going to last, what the scope is going to be. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1523.26s)]
*  And I think the bigger question for the region and internationally is the very real risk that [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1528.22s)]
*  the very real risk that this war could spread, that the United States could get involved. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1535.9s)]
*  So there's a real fear that this war will be quite catastrophic. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1544.3s)]
*  Farnaz, thank you so much for your time. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1558.14s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1560.38s)]
*  As of Sunday night, Iranian strikes killed at least 10 people in Israel, according to [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1565.66s)]
*  an Israeli rescue service, bringing the total death toll to 14. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1571.5s)]
*  And the country's main airport and airspace remained closed. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1575.98s)]
*  In Iran, the health ministry reported that more than 200 people have been [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1580.06s)]
*  killed since the attacks began on Friday. We'll be right back. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1583.9s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. Americans are likely to start feeling the impact of the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1595.98s)]
*  escalating conflict between Israel and Iran as more expensive oil causes prices at the gas pump [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFRjB9jPgos&t=1601.18s)]
