# Two Blue States That Will Determine Control of Congress
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrALww-Qghg)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  There's never been any doubt that this year's presidential race would be won or lost in a
*  handful of purple swing states where neither party has a clear advantage.
*  That however is not the case for Congress.
*  Today, my colleague Nick Fandos on why control of the House is likely to hinge on what happens
*  in two deeply blue states where Democrats run the show.
*  It's Tuesday, October 15th.
*  Nick, thank you for making time for us on a holiday, no less.
*  Michael, I am very pleased to be here.
*  So I feel like if you're keeping count, I dare say we have made 100 episodes.
*  That's an exaggeration, but a lot of episodes about the presidential race.
*  But we have spent comparatively little time talking about who's going to control Congress.
*  And today with you, we are going to rectify that.
*  And in particular, we're going to talk about control of the House of Representatives, the
*  lower chamber.
*  Set the stage for us and walk us through the stakes of this year's races for the House.
*  Yeah, let me make a case for why the House of Representatives is uniquely important in
*  this election.
*  So obviously, as we all know, the race for the White House is incredibly close.
*  But the race for the Senate is really tipping towards Republicans right now.
*  Democrats have a shot, but it's an outside shot to keep control of the Senate.
*  So the House of Representatives is really kind of the second most important question,
*  because if Donald Trump wins the White House and Republicans have the Senate, the House
*  being Republican would be a trifecta.
*  It would unlock his ability to implement most of his policy agenda.
*  It would protect him from investigation or impeachment and really kind of lay the groundwork
*  for two years of conservative Republican policymaking.
*  On the other hand, if Kamala Harris wins the White House and doesn't have control of the
*  Senate, the House is really going to be her only leverage point on Capitol Hill.
*  It's going to be the kind of Democratic beachhead to help her try and get anything
*  accomplished. But it is so close this year that there's a feasible possibility that
*  actually Trump could win the White House and Democrats could keep control of the House,
*  which would be a very powerful, potent check on a potential Trump presidency.
*  Remember, they impeached him twice before when he was in office.
*  Right. In other words, no matter what happens, no matter who wins the White House, the
*  House becomes the linchpin for either unified government or divided
*  government. Very consequential, either way.
*  Precisely. And even before that happens, the House is going to play a very important
*  role in the kind of end stages of this presidential election.
*  It is, as we all learned in 2021, the body that has to certify at the end the results
*  of the presidential election.
*  Right.
*  And last time, Donald Trump and his allies in the House were able to make a remarkable
*  run at trying to disrupt that process, despite the fact that Democrats were in
*  control of the House.
*  So one can imagine a scenario where this time around, if Republicans narrowly hold
*  on to it and the presidential election ends up in a near tie or another contested
*  outcome, who is in control on Capitol Hill could be unbelievably important.
*  I just want to make sure I understand that because I think the timing can get confusing
*  for people. We think of Congress being sworn in around the time of the presidential
*  inauguration actually happens before.
*  So a new Congress will be required to certify the results of the election.
*  You're saying if Republicans win control of the House of Representatives and Kamala
*  Harris were to win the presidential race, then suddenly you're looking at a
*  Republican controlled House that may try to block her certification as president,
*  which would once again plunge this country into a very complicated and potentially
*  very dark place.
*  I think that that's a good summary and certainly a question and a scenario that's on a
*  lot of people's minds right now.
*  Right. So what, Nick, is the current understanding of both parties' chances of winning
*  control of the House right now?
*  You explained when it comes to the Senate that the odds are very much that Republicans
*  will flip it, win control.
*  Now walk us through the odds of the House.
*  Yeah, the House is a true toss up.
*  It is on a knife's edge.
*  Republicans right now effectively have a four seat majority, basically the narrowest
*  majority in the century, and they're out there defending it.
*  And there's a very limited number of competitive seats across the country because of
*  gerrymandering in both parties, which have shrunk the map.
*  A few dozen seats that could tip either way and an even smaller number of that that may
*  affect the final outcome.
*  But the really interesting feature of the race for the House this year is that the true
*  battlegrounds don't match up with the presidential race.
*  We're not talking about Wisconsin or Pennsylvania.
*  There are some races there, but the biggest clusters are actually in two large coastal
*  blue states, New York and California.
*  And why would that be?
*  Well, let me just give a sense of numbers first, which I think will help illustrate
*  this. There are 17 seats that Republicans hold right now that President Biden won four
*  years ago. Of those, 10 of them are in New York and California.
*  And five or six of them, Biden actually won by double digits.
*  So to put it a different way, Republicans in 2020 and 2022 were able to win a set of
*  districts to build their majority that, you know, by registration or makeup tend to tilt
*  Democratic or vote for Democrats for president.
*  And so that means that Democrats clear his path to winning back the majority runs through
*  those two states.
*  What do we need to remember about those races two years ago?
*  That helps explain this dynamic and how we got here in these two deep blue states.
*  So just to rewind the clock a little bit, remember, you know, 2022 was Biden's first
*  midterm. Typically the party out of power.
*  Republicans are expected to make a bunch of gains across the country in the House.
*  Republicans were expecting to pick up a pretty big majority.
*  And by and large, they had an underwhelming night in most of the country, except for New
*  York and California.
*  And there are different reasons for that.
*  New York and California, as anyone who has visited there or lives there knows, are very
*  expensive places.
*  And so they're extra sensitive to inflation and food and housing and basically put voters
*  into a very sour mood.
*  At the same time, the pandemic brought this disruption to life all across the board and a
*  spiking crime in some places.
*  And it was really intensely felt, for instance, in New York.
*  Where a daily drumbeat of crimes on the subway or violent crimes on the street became kind
*  of the dominant issue of the midterm campaigns.
*  And Republicans were able to really effectively message on this issue.
*  And I think that the thing that unifies these states is that they're both states where
*  Democrats have total control of government.
*  Where voters are looking at these problems, which many places are facing across the
*  country, but they have one party basically that's in charge that they can blame.
*  Democrats control mayors offices, the governor's mansions and the White House.
*  So, you know, why wouldn't you if you're fed up about these issues and you think that
*  government is not doing enough to help?
*  Well, you know, you go against the guys in power and that meant going with Republicans.
*  Right. So in that sense, Republicans weaponized New York and California's blueness and used
*  it against them very effectively through the issue, especially of crime.
*  Precisely. And there was another issue with that blueness that actually hurt Democrats.
*  It's a little different. So across the country, abortion rights were one of the biggest
*  rallying cries for Democratic candidates in the midterms.
*  And they actually had a lot of success in swing states where voters perceived their
*  abortion rights to be at risk after the Supreme Court had overturned Roe v.
*  Wade. But in New York and California, I think voters were a little bit more dubious about
*  that. They knew that Democratic supermajorities in
*  Sacramento and Albany were not about to overturn abortion rights.
*  And so the issue just wasn't quite as potent in motivating Democratic voters to come
*  out in the same kind of numbers that Republicans who were concerned about cost of living
*  and crime and independence were to come out and vote against them.
*  And so by the time election night comes around.
*  Now, it was a bumpy night on Long Island for Democrats.
*  We start seeing these districts from Long Island up through the suburbs of Westchester
*  and the Hudson Valley start flipping towards Republicans one by one.
*  There was good reason for Republicans to cheer at their watch party in Nassau County
*  on election night. They just turned blue districts red.
*  And in California, a number of seats that Democrats thought Republicans had no
*  business representing that they'd won in 2020, they start holding those races.
*  Each one of them tips towards Republicans.
*  California's 27th District.
*  This win for Republicans is the 218th seat.
*  Republicans have now secured a majority in the House of Representatives.
*  And at the end of the night, it all adds up to be enough for Republicans to take the
*  House majority. Right.
*  And the question is, is that going to happen again this year on Election Day?
*  Are Republicans going to be able to motivate, especially these suburban voters on
*  anxieties around cost and crime?
*  And will Democrats fail to motivate their suburban voters in these same districts
*  around essential Democratic motivating issues like abortion?
*  That could well determine, as it did two years ago, who controls the House this year.
*  I think that is the most pertinent question, because Democrats feel that they have
*  learned a lot of lessons from 2022.
*  Their candidates are better funded.
*  They're running more adept campaigns, targeting more voters.
*  They're not taking these districts for granted.
*  And most importantly, they are aggressively messaging on a lot of the issues that
*  voters still say they care about.
*  Crime, cost of living, immigration has really creeped up.
*  And the result, I think, is an election where, on paper at least, Democrats have a
*  lot of really good pickup opportunities.
*  It looks like they should have a clean path back to the majority.
*  But in reality, poll after poll is showing these races within the margin of error that
*  they could flip in either direction.
*  And as I'm thinking about all these things, there's one district in particular in the
*  suburbs just north of New York City where a lot of these issues are coming into play.
*  The possibility for Democrats of winning back the House, but also the reality for
*  Republicans of having a strong set of issues and candidates to defend their ground on.
*  And the outcome of that race, which could come relatively early on election night, is
*  probably going to tell us a lot about which way the whole House is tipping.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Nick, take us inside of this New York House race that you have been tracking pretty closely.
*  So this is New York's 17th district.
*  Just up the Hudson River from New York City.
*  It's kind of an interesting and complicated district.
*  So a lot of it is the northern suburbs of Westchester County, which on balance are really
*  pretty affluent. This is the home in Chappaqua, for instance, of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
*  They're kind of sprawling country estate and there's multimillion dollar houses all up
*  and down the Hudson. But at the same time, just across the river, there's communities in
*  Rockland County that are more ex-urban, more working class, retired or active cops and
*  firefighters and their families that tend to be a more traditional swing district.
*  If you add it all up, this has been real friendly to Democrats in the past.
*  Biden won this district by 10 points, something like 80,000 more registered Democrats
*  than Republicans. But in 2022, in the midterms, this Republican assemblyman named Mike Lawler
*  kind of comes out of nowhere and ends up defeating one of the most powerful Democrats in
*  Congress for this seat.
*  He harnesses a lot of the issues that we've been talking about and takes down this guy,
*  Sean Patrick Maloney, who was not only defending his own seat, but was the head of House
*  Democrats campaign arm responsible for defending the majority nationwide.
*  Right. Lawler doesn't take out just any Democrat.
*  He takes out a kind of Democratic lion who's supposed to protect the rest of House
*  Democrats. Exactly.
*  And he does it through some really adept messaging, taking each of these issues that
*  we've been talking about and deploying them in very specific ways.
*  The best example of this is around crime.
*  So in New York, the crime issue was really kind of localized and intensified around the
*  issue of cash or cashless bail.
*  Right. Democrats in New York, with good intentions of trying to get rid of this practice,
*  had pretty dramatically changed New York's bail laws in recent years.
*  Today, we are pleased to bring you a debate among all four candidates running for the
*  end. Lawler had an old clip that turned out to be really valuable of his opponent,
*  Sean Patrick Maloney.
*  Do you believe in ending cash bail, Mr.
*  Maloney? Absolutely.
*  And I'd make it the top priority.
*  Saying on a debate stage, I support getting rid of cashless bail.
*  Now, the legacy of cashless bail is complicated.
*  But in this moment, remember where crime has kind of bubbled up after the pandemic?
*  It's a really easy scapegoat for Republicans to point to and say this is the reason this
*  is the cause. Is this guy serious?
*  Sean Maloney said his top priority was releasing dangerous criminals so they can commit
*  more crimes. That's nuts.
*  And Democrats didn't quite know how to respond to this.
*  They tried defending the law.
*  They tried changing the subject.
*  And on Election Day, it turns out that a lot of voters were very agitated and very worked
*  up about it. And Lawler wins by just the tiniest of margins, a few thousand votes
*  to become the Republican congressman and a kind of instant celebrity by dint of beating
*  the National House Democratic chairman.
*  And what kind of congressman does Lawler turn out to be given the dynamics of this
*  district? He knows he's just wanted by a hair.
*  Yeah. So Lawler knows from day one that he's going to have to defend this seat in two
*  years. So he spends a lot of time from the very beginning reaching out to groups that
*  you wouldn't expect a Republican to talk to.
*  It is critical in this day and age to have strong Republican support for labor.
*  He courts labor unions.
*  He courts independent and Democratic leaning moderates.
*  When House Republicans ousted Kevin McCarthy, Lawler was like unmissable on CNN for
*  weeks talking about how stupid his party was, how idiotic it was and out of control.
*  All of that work, all of that important work has now been upended by these eight selfish
*  people who joined up with the squad to frankly upend the institution of the House and
*  create a constitutional crisis.
*  Not the kind of thing you would expect somebody to normally do.
*  Right. Right.
*  And it's good to be back.
*  At one point, as Washington is headed towards a debt default, President Biden actually
*  travels to Lawler's own district to try and put pressure on him to strike a debt limit
*  deal. The Republican Congress, Mike Lawler is here as well.
*  Mike's on the other team. But you know what?
*  Mike is the kind of guy that when when I was in the Congress, they were the kind of
*  Republican I was used to dealing with.
*  And he ends up complimenting the guy.
*  He's not one of these mega Republicans.
*  He says like, this is the kind of guy that I can work with.
*  He's not like the rest of his party.
*  I don't want to get him in trouble by saying anything nice about him or negative about
*  him. But thanks for coming, Mike.
*  Thanks for being here. This is the way we used to do it all the time.
*  He was trying to establish this independent brand that like, yeah, there's an R behind
*  my name, but like, I'm willing to vote across the aisle.
*  I'm willing to criticize my own party.
*  He presents himself in all of this as kind of the adults in the room.
*  It's time we work together to get our country moving again and leave the games to the
*  kids. So all of this, I think, is important because Lawler knows heading into the next
*  election that he's not going to have the element of surprise this time.
*  The environment may be different.
*  It may not. He's going to need some Democratic and independent voters to stick with him
*  and maybe come over to his side if he's going to win a second term.
*  Mm hmm. OK, so Lawler proves very deft at being the kind of Republican that this district
*  can embrace perhaps twice in a row.
*  Talk about who he is facing on the Democratic side in this year's House race.
*  His Democratic opponent is Mondaire Jones.
*  I was lucky to grow up in Rockland County.
*  Jones is a former one term Democratic congressman who lost his seat after redistricting in
*  2022, but he's got a lot of strengths as a candidate raised by a young single mom who
*  like so many incredible women throughout this district still had to work multiple jobs to
*  make ends meet. He's got this remarkable biography, like really an American dream story.
*  My grandfather was a janitor and my grandmother clean homes.
*  He grew up poor. He ended up at Harvard Law School, became a lawyer, worked in government
*  and then won a seat in Congress.
*  Growing up, I didn't see people like me in Congress.
*  Then I was elected to represent the same people whose homes I watched my grandmother clean.
*  It was the kind of guy who looked like, you know, he could make Mike Lawler a one term
*  congressman. But Jones also has some real baggage because when he ran the first time, he ran as
*  just an out and out progressive.
*  This was in 2020. It was after George Floyd was murdered.
*  It was in the middle of the pandemic.
*  He was for at the time defunding the police.
*  You know, he was really against a lot of the Trump era border and immigration policies.
*  And he staked his tent with the left and with progressives, which at the time was quite
*  convenient. And now has turned out to be a real heavyweight around his neck.
*  I'm going to guess that Lawler is pointing to all of those old policy positions and
*  statements in this year's race.
*  Exactly. So just like he was able to use old clips of Sean Patrick Maloney to remarkable
*  effect to hurt him, he's turning to, you know, old statements that Jones made that in
*  many cases he now rebukes.
*  He says he was wrong about defund the police.
*  He's advocating for more aggressive border policies this time around.
*  But the problem is, you know, when voters TVs are being saturated with all these old
*  clips.
*  Liberal Mondaire Jones wanted to defund the police.
*  He did in mass incarceration and defund the police, defunding the police, cutting that
*  funding and reallocating it to social workers.
*  And ads from Mike Lawler that try and portray Jones as more accountable to AOC, to Andrea
*  Ocasio-Cortez than to the voters of this district.
*  The pride of New York right now, Mondaire Jones.
*  That's AOC praising Mondaire Jones because Jones supports her radical agenda.
*  It undermines some of what Jones is trying to do to look more pragmatic.
*  And that's what he feels he needs to do to win this district.
*  So Lawler is very much trying to make this year's race a carbon copy of the race two
*  years ago, where it becomes a referendum on whether Democrats are too progressive on
*  criminal justice policy and therefore not basically hard enough on crime.
*  And he's got some ammunition there in Mondaire Jones's record.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  The issues may be a little different than 2022, but the pattern is basically the same.
*  I'm the adult in the room.
*  I'm the reasonable one.
*  I may not be the party you're used to, but I'm going to be much more responsible actor
*  in Washington for you than these crazy out of touch Democrats.
*  And how, Nick, is Mondaire Jones framing this race?
*  Yeah, so Jones is running his own very aggressive campaign here, and he is maybe
*  unsurprisingly focusing on the issue of abortion.
*  Lawler empowers the worst people in Washington.
*  Their platform would ban abortions even here in New York without exception for rape or
*  incest. Democrats think this time around, actually, it's a more potent issue because
*  there's a presidential election at the top of the ticket, the specter of potentially a
*  national abortion ban.
*  They think will really motivate their voters even in these Democratic states.
*  Congressman Mike Lawler always votes against abortion, so we have to stop this guy.
*  He is trying to take Lawler's record on this specific issue and show that it exposes
*  him as kind of a fraud generally, that he may say he's a moderate, but at the end of
*  the day, he mostly votes with his own party.
*  Right. He's saying Joe Biden might have praised him, but he's anti-abortion.
*  Exactly. So all this has meant a very close.
*  And contentious race for months.
*  There's been some surprises, some of them brought by you yourself.
*  Indeed. Earlier this month, I got a hold of some photographs of Lawler when he was a
*  college student in the early 2000s, dressing up for Halloween and Blackface.
*  He was a Michael Jackson super fan.
*  He still is. He even went out as an 18 year old to Michael Jackson's criminal trial in
*  California to attend it.
*  But obviously, the imagery of Blackface is very charged and very offensive.
*  Right. But it's unclear how much of an electoral impact this is going to have in the end.
*  Lawler really didn't run away from it.
*  He went right into it.
*  What did he say? For me, there was no ill intent.
*  There was no effort to malign or make fun of or disparage black Americans.
*  He went on CNN and said, look, I'm aware of the history of what Blackface is.
*  That's not what I was trying to do here.
*  It was really an effort to pay homage to somebody who was a musical idol for me.
*  I've always loved Michael Jackson's music and his dance moves.
*  Jones, for his part, called on Lawler to drop out of the race and resign from his seat.
*  Mike Lawler knew exactly what he was doing.
*  And he's not having his apology or explanation at all.
*  He says, you know exactly what you were doing and is only upset because he got caught
*  doing it and not because he actually engaged in offensive behavior.
*  And you don't really seem that sorry.
*  And so that brings us more or less to the present where Lawler has maintained a
*  narrow lead in the polls.
*  It's narrow enough that on Election Day, this race could tip in either direction.
*  You know, that I think is indicative, going back to this broader story about the
*  climate in a state like New York or California of just how surprisingly close
*  each of these races are.
*  Nick, we're spending all this time talking about the particular dynamics of this
*  district, New York 17, and the two candidates who are running for this seat.
*  But I'm curious how the dynamics of the presidential race between Donald Trump and
*  Kamala Harris are likely to affect turnout in this district and voters' attitudes
*  about the two candidates.
*  Yeah, it's such an interesting one because obviously the presidential candidates are
*  not really spending any time in a district like this and in New York.
*  They're not really spending money here, but they are driving the kind of national
*  mood around the election.
*  For instance, you know, Democrats like Jones, I think, were really heartened when
*  Joe Biden dropped out and Kamala Harris got in because they saw the energy from
*  their base, the engagement, the number of volunteers ready to sign up for them,
*  just like skyrocket.
*  And I think generally their theory of the case has been that in a presidential
*  election, your turnout is much higher than a midterm.
*  Both parties tend to turn out with enthusiasm.
*  And at the end of the day, it's a Democratic district.
*  And if everybody turns out the Democrat wins.
*  Now, the interesting thing about that, I think, is that there's a Republican theory
*  that Trump is actually becoming somewhat more palatable or at least less offensive
*  in districts like these over time.
*  Can you explain that?
*  We've been seeing in national polling that Trump is actually improving most in
*  states like New York and California.
*  Blue states that he's never going to win, but where voters may be looking at his
*  economic policies or his presidency with some nostalgia and saying, you know, he's
*  not quite as bad as we thought or not as dangerous as we thought, or, you know, I
*  still don't like him, but look what the Democrats have reaped in terms of
*  inflation and crime and all these other issues.
*  And this matters in these districts.
*  Again, not because it will affect Trump's outcome, but if Kamala Harris is winning
*  Mike Lawler's district by five points instead of the 10 that Biden won it by,
*  it's a lot easier for Lawler to run ahead of the Republican ticket and still be
*  able to win.
*  So I think one of the questions I'm really interested in as we head into election
*  day is actually how Trump performs in all these districts, because it's going to
*  give us the answer of whether 2022 was just an aberration in places like New York
*  and California, or if, you know, some of these suburban exurban places that swung
*  away from the Republicans during the kind of early to mid Trump era are now swinging
*  back in a way that it's going to make them more competitive for years to come.
*  You're raising the possibility, which I'm sure Democrats are very loath to
*  contemplate, that Republicans have been developing in the Trump era a structural
*  advantage in these blue state swing districts.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know that I would go as far as to say an advantage, but they have been
*  eating into and eroding Democrats' advantage, the advantage that they had and
*  getting it back towards more kind of neutral competitive territory.
*  And the question in this election is whether they can lock that in and in doing
*  so, open up possibilities for themselves, not just this November, but in November's
*  to come.
*  But it's not a feta complete.
*  Harris and Mondaire Jones, like they get this, they're trying to communicate to
*  voters that we have heard you.
*  And if they can successfully convince them that they have, that they feel their
*  economic pain, that they understand, you know, some of the policies that they
*  passed are not the direction that voters want to go in, then they could flip the
*  script and buy themselves two more years to continue to change the Democratic image
*  in the way that they want to and potentially reverse some of this swing back
*  towards the Republicans in ways that could be just as meaningful and lasting.
*  Well, Nick, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  You are welcome as always, Michael.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The Times reports that Russia has recaptured several villages inside its own
*  borders that Ukraine had invaded over the summer.
*  That could threaten Ukraine's plan to use those Russian towns as leverage in
*  negotiations to end the war.
*  Ukraine still holds roughly 300 square miles of Russian territory, but that's
*  down from about 400 square miles that Ukraine occupied in the first week of its
*  invasion back in August.
*  And here we go.
*  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ignition and lift off.
*  On Monday, NASA launched its first mission to Jupiter in more than a decade.
*  This time, the objective is not to investigate the planet itself, but instead
*  one of its moons called Europa.
*  Lift off and stop and heavy with Europa Clipper unveiling the mysteries of an
*  enormous ocean lurking beneath the icy crust of Jupiter's moon, Europa.
*  The $5 billion mission will study whether Europa, Jupiter's fourth largest moon,
*  possesses conditions favorable for life.
