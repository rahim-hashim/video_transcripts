# The Demise of U.S.A.I.D. — and American Soft Power
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=4.4s)]
*  As President Trump demolishes the government's biggest provider of foreign aid, the United [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=21.72s)]
*  States Agency for International Development, which he calls wasteful and misguided. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=26.32s)]
*  He's ending a 60-year bipartisan consensus about the best way to keep America safe from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=40.96s)]
*  its enemies. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=47.44s)]
*  Today, my colleagues State Department Reporter Michael Crowley and Health Reporter Stephanie [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=50.6s)]
*  Nolah on the rise and fall of USAID and American soft power. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  It's Tuesday, February 11. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=65.4s)]
*  Michael as we speak to you, USAID has basically been dismantled. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=89.92s)]
*  A judge has paused elements of that dismantling, but the writing is very much on the wall. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=94.88s)]
*  It's a shell of itself, so much so that its name has literally been removed from its headquarters [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=99.28s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=104.56s)]
*  I think a lot of us have the sense that this elimination of this agency is a very big deal, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  even if we don't entirely understand exactly how USAID worked and why the United States [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  was doing so much of this kind of foreign aid work on this scale to begin with. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  What is that back story? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=124.84s)]
*  Well, USAID was founded by President John F. Kennedy, who created it with an executive [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=126.92s)]
*  order in 1961. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=132.28s)]
*  And he did that not out of some pure sense of charity, not out of a sense that there [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=134.28s)]
*  was famine in the world and America had a responsibility to address it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=143.2s)]
*  The people who are opposed to aid should realize that this is a very powerful source of strength [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  for us. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=157.12s)]
*  It was a matter of national security. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=161.0s)]
*  It permits us to exert influence for the maintenance of freedom. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=164.84s)]
*  He was reacting to the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union that was underway at [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  the time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=175.4s)]
*  We were not so heavily involved. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=176.4s)]
*  Our voice would not speak with such a bigger. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=180.56s)]
*  And which he saw as a real threat to America's primacy and security. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=184.24s)]
*  And the Soviet Union was presenting itself as the champion, particularly in the developing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  world of countries that had been under colonialism for decades or more and felt that they had [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=194.88s)]
*  been treated badly by the West. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=205.04s)]
*  And as we do not want to send American troops to a great many areas where freedom may be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  under attack, we send you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  And Kennedy felt like America had to show that we are not exploiting the world around [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  us. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=223.2s)]
*  We care about its welfare. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=224.2s)]
*  Working with the people in those countries to try to work with them in developing the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=225.76s)]
*  thrust of their country so that they can make a determination that they can solve their [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=233.04s)]
*  problems without resorting to totalitarian control and becoming part of the block. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=237.28s)]
*  And ultimately, this is the most important part. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=241.84s)]
*  Choose us and not the Soviet Union. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=244.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=247.6s)]
*  Choose democracy and capitalism, not communism. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=249.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=252.92s)]
*  And in Kennedy's mind, the United States had a real problem. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=253.92s)]
*  The United States was at risk of losing this competition with the Soviet Union. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=257.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=262.16s)]
*  Well, one thing that motivated Kennedy and it's such an interesting footnote to all of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=263.16s)]
*  this was a popular bestselling book at the time called The Ugly American. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=266.36s)]
*  The Ugly American essentially told the story that American diplomats in Asia were out of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=273.24s)]
*  touch with the places where they were working. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=280.44s)]
*  They didn't understand the local culture. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=283.36s)]
*  They seemed like they had parachuted in from another world and in some cases made more [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=287.0s)]
*  enemies than friends. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=294.24s)]
*  And this was a big problem for the United States that Americans were seen as ugly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=296.0s)]
*  And Kennedy actually recommended that his associates and members of Congress read this [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=301.08s)]
*  book to understand this problem. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=306.84s)]
*  And he felt like America had to stop presenting the ugly face and had to present a more benevolent, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=308.56s)]
*  helpful face. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=315.68s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  So USAID in Kennedy's mind is the antidote to the perception of the ugly American. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  It is the generous American, the altruistic American who shows up strategically with humanitarian [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=323.08s)]
*  aid and makes your life if you're overseas skeptical of America materially better. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=329.6s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=337.24s)]
*  USAID is building schools, building hospitals, providing people with clean drinking water, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=338.24s)]
*  life saving medicines, helping them find employment, developing local infrastructure, all kinds [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  of things that help people in a fundamental day to day way have better lives in these [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=350.72s)]
*  countries. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=356.92s)]
*  But part of what's happening as USAID does this work is you're gaining influence, you're [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  getting to know government officials, you're getting to know people in the local population. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=363.16s)]
*  So this kind of becomes the basis of what we know as soft power, which is distinct from [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  hard power. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=373.04s)]
*  It's military power. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=374.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=375.16s)]
*  Soft power is influence in relationships. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=376.16s)]
*  And a bipartisan consensus forms around the value of soft power as an instrument of American [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=378.56s)]
*  foreign policy going forward for decades. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=385.12s)]
*  And so Kennedy launches USAID, but year after year, presidents of both parties accept USAID [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=388.74s)]
*  as a central part of American foreign policy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  I have to imagine, however, that when the US wins the Cold War by the end of the 1980s, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=398.84000000000003s)]
*  the early 1990s, that this poses something of a challenge to USAID's purpose. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=403.76s)]
*  It does. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  But at the same time, some pretty good new rationales emerge for the continuation of a [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  robust USAID. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=417.59999999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=419.2s)]
*  Because after 9-11, America realized that the Soviet communist ideology that threatened [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=420.28s)]
*  us had been replaced by a new ideology. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  It was a terrorist ideology. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=429.68s)]
*  Radical fundamentalism that was emerging from parts of the world where USAID did a lot of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=431.96s)]
*  work. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=437.76s)]
*  And that terrorism really flourished in countries where there was instability, weak civil society. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=438.96s)]
*  When a state collapses entirely, that becomes a breeding ground for radicalism. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=447.12s)]
*  And so there was a new value placed on American aid programs in countries that could maintain [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=452.0s)]
*  instability, try to help find jobs for people who might otherwise turn to radicalism. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=459.0s)]
*  All kinds of programs that were perceived as being part of the mission of combating [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=464.88s)]
*  worldwide terrorism. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=469.36s)]
*  But it's also during that period that we see some of USAID's real limitations and frankly, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=471.12s)]
*  some of the most wasteful projects that it's ever undertaken. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=476.88s)]
*  Huh, like what? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=479.8s)]
*  Well, there was one project in Afghanistan known as Promote that was meant to empower [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=481.2s)]
*  women in the country, give them workplace experience. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  It was originally budgeted at $280 million and it was supposed to help 75,000 women get [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=491.26s)]
*  jobs, promotions, apprenticeships, internships. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=497.29999999999995s)]
*  But an inspector general report that came out a few years ago found that only 55 women [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=501.21999999999997s)]
*  had been promoted to better jobs. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=506.78s)]
*  Wow, out of 75,000 original goal. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=508.53999999999996s)]
*  That was the original goal. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=511.53999999999996s)]
*  And the inspector general essentially said the whole thing had been a complete waste. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=513.6999999999999s)]
*  So basically a nearly $300 million program funded by us, the taxpayer turned out to have [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=517.62s)]
*  been a boondoggle. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=522.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, basically down the tubes. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=524.42s)]
*  So look, you might cut them some slack for having been in a war zone. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=527.36s)]
*  A lot of projects were tried by a lot of different parts of the US government in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=531.74s)]
*  that just flopped. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=536.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=537.98s)]
*  Even granting that, USAID has maintained strong bipartisan support for years and years. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=538.98s)]
*  And the view of both parties is that not every project is going to work perfectly. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=545.5s)]
*  Not every dollar is going to give you an ideal return, but that at the end of the day, relative [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=549.9s)]
*  to the national budget, USAID does not spend that much money. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=556.02s)]
*  And actually overall, you get a good return on your dollar and you're getting real value [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=560.54s)]
*  for American interests and that USAID is important to continue and support that it's really good [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  for the United States of America. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=573.54s)]
*  Perhaps the clearest example of how USAID exerts American soft power is through the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=578.7s)]
*  work it's done in public health. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=585.1s)]
*  And to understand that, I spoke with my colleague, global health reporter Stephanie Nolan. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  Stephanie, how big a part of USAID's budget and work is health care, the subject you have [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=595.98s)]
*  spent so much of your career covering? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=613.0600000000001s)]
*  So it's roughly a third. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=616.1s)]
*  If you think about USAID having a budget of about $40 billion, about $12.5 billion of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=617.82s)]
*  that was spent on health care. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=623.62s)]
*  Wow. So it's a really meaningful part of what this agency does around the world. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=625.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=629.9s)]
*  And in your global travels, which are many and varied, how frequently do you encounter [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=631.46s)]
*  a USAID program of one kind or another? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=637.7s)]
*  I would have to think for a long time to think of a trip when I have not come across either [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=644.14s)]
*  U.S.-funded research or medications or humanitarian assistance. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=650.14s)]
*  And one of the big ones is the HIV program, which was started at the height of, you know, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=656.46s)]
*  if you think back 20 years to when there were almost 30 million people living with HIV in [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=663.26s)]
*  sub-Saharan Africa and no treatment and people were dying and just these extraordinary [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=667.62s)]
*  numbers. And at that point, President George W. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=672.4200000000001s)]
*  Bush created this emergency AIDS response program, and it has brought life-saving HIV [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=675.42s)]
*  medication to millions and millions of people. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=681.42s)]
*  Today, there's about 21 million people who rely on that program for that medication. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=684.38s)]
*  It's been responsible for getting drugs to hundreds of thousands of women with HIV who [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=688.9799999999999s)]
*  were giving birth to make sure that their babies weren't infected. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=695.26s)]
*  Less well-known, but I would argue about as important, is something called the President's [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=698.86s)]
*  Malaria Initiative, and it does malaria control programs across the countries that have [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=703.5s)]
*  the highest burden of malaria. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=710.26s)]
*  And they do an extraordinary range of things from helping people put the chemicals in [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=712.46s)]
*  water supply to control mosquitoes, giving out bed nets, giving out malaria treatments, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=719.46s)]
*  supporting the research that finds new drugs to control the parasites. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=725.7s)]
*  They've played, I would say, like an essential role in the fact that deaths from malaria [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=729.9000000000001s)]
*  were cut in half over the last 15 years that the program was operating. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=734.46s)]
*  So let me be dense for just a moment, deliberately so. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=739.0200000000001s)]
*  How do those two programs, which are clearly saving hundreds of thousands, in the case [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  of the HIV program, millions of lives in places like Africa, how in the minds of USAID and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=749.0200000000001s)]
*  the US government do those, beyond the indisputable altruism that you're describing, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=756.9s)]
*  advance American interest, as this program has always been envisioned? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=762.34s)]
*  I think one really basic but important thing is that it really directly touches people's [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  lives, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=774.02s)]
*  You're getting help and it's made clear to you where that help is coming from. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=775.66s)]
*  So the medications you get, emergency supplies, tents, food aid, it all comes branded [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=779.62s)]
*  with the words, a gift of the people of the United States, right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=786.74s)]
*  And it's a message from the US government saying, we are here for you in this difficult [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=790.5s)]
*  moment, in your moment of need. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=796.9s)]
*  We are a compassionate and benevolent actor. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=798.3s)]
*  We are good guys who care about you. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=801.5s)]
*  We're on your team. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=804.1s)]
*  And that's like viewed as laying a kind of cornerstone for a positive foreign policy [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=805.02s)]
*  relationship. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=809.94s)]
*  Right. This is essentially President Kennedy's vision of USAID from the beginning, which [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=811.02s)]
*  we just talked about with Michael Crowley. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=815.7s)]
*  This is the opposite of the imperialistic, ugly American image that Kennedy was trying [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=817.7800000000001s)]
*  to fight. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=824.26s)]
*  Exactly. You're taking your baby in to get TB medication and the little counter that [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=825.5400000000001s)]
*  they're sitting your kid up on to weigh and examine them has a little American flag in [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=833.22s)]
*  the corner. This is not a nefarious actor, right? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=837.46s)]
*  This is a country that's here to help. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=841.94s)]
*  And then I think, you know, it's also important to recognize that this, of course, is not [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=844.18s)]
*  only about goodwill. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=848.6999999999999s)]
*  There is economic value in a lot of this for America and American companies. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=850.78s)]
*  So how so? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=857.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, as I look back over kind of 25 years of covering the response to the AIDS epidemic, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=859.4599999999999s)]
*  keeping those people alive was the right thing to do. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=866.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, in human terms, it also had economic payoff, right? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=871.0999999999999s)]
*  Like I used to go to Zambia, for example, and report when close to a third of people who [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=874.5799999999999s)]
*  would be your productive workforce, like people between the ages of about 18 and 45, a third [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=880.9s)]
*  of those people had untreated HIV. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=885.8199999999999s)]
*  Right. So now today, 20 years later, thanks in large part to this US funded program, almost [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=888.18s)]
*  all of those people with HIV are on treatment. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=893.66s)]
*  They're back to work. They don't even think about it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=896.0999999999999s)]
*  And that's obviously incredibly valuable for them, for their families. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=898.5799999999999s)]
*  But it also had an economic impact on the country. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=903.78s)]
*  Right. Like it became a much more economically stable country when it was not being crippled [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=906.9s)]
*  by HIV. And is it kind of grim to think about it in these terms? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=911.6999999999999s)]
*  Sure. But if you're looking for a justification for the investment of American taxpayer [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=916.46s)]
*  dollars, well, Zambia has a very busy mining sector. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=921.38s)]
*  The US has a lot of mining interest there, including agreements for electric [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=924.98s)]
*  vehicle supply chains. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=929.1s)]
*  So I think it's pretty clear that this was the right thing to do in human terms. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=930.3000000000001s)]
*  It also had direct economic benefit to the United States. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=935.62s)]
*  That might sound kind of very pragmatic, but you're saying the reality is that when the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=940.1s)]
*  United States does right by the people of Zambia by giving them HIV drugs and saving [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=945.34s)]
*  their lives, they happen to ensure the country's economic health persists in a way [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=950.98s)]
*  that way downstream benefits Americans and the American economy, which really does [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=957.98s)]
*  feel like the ultimate win-win version of foreign aid. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=965.1800000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. And every year or every couple of years, a USAID partner [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=970.1800000000001s)]
*  country kind of graduates from the roles of foreign assistance and stops being a [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=976.82s)]
*  country that's getting USAID and becomes just a trading partner. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=981.5s)]
*  Like there is ultimately long-term economic payoff in something like helping a [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=986.1s)]
*  community get bed nets and malaria treatment in all of their rural clinics. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=992.1800000000001s)]
*  And you're suggesting that that journey from being dependent on foreign aid to becoming [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=997.34s)]
*  a potential US trading partner, that journey seems unimaginable if these countries can't [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1002.66s)]
*  surmount their overwhelming HIV and malaria problems to begin with, which is what the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1007.46s)]
*  American assistance allowed them to do. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1012.14s)]
*  I think this gets to another point because these countries that have received all of [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1014.38s)]
*  this assistance, we imagine them becoming global actors who are also American allies. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1019.74s)]
*  And the US is not the only country capable of providing this kind of assistance. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1025.82s)]
*  When I go to Zambia these days, I actually see a bigger presence from China than I do [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1030.38s)]
*  the US. And so not only is the US attempting to buy some goodwill, but they're [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1035.38s)]
*  occupying space that otherwise might be taken up by other people. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1040.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's also sort of a deliberate foreign policy play in that way. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1045.66s)]
*  I think that brings us to the moment we're in, right, where President Trump is [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1050.9s)]
*  inaugurated, looks at this agency and sees a lot of problems. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1054.98s)]
*  I mean, is he right to think that there is some real cost cutting to be done at USAID, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1060.58s)]
*  putting aside the extent of it for just the moment? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1068.22s)]
*  I will say that everyone I have ever spoken to who works for USAID has said that they [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1071.18s)]
*  wished that things about the organization were done differently and more efficiently [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1080.02s)]
*  and often in a way that would probably save money. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1085.66s)]
*  I don't think I've ever met anyone who worked there who would not have said that there [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1089.22s)]
*  was room for significant improvement and lots of ways that things could have been done [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1093.9s)]
*  better. But I don't think any of those people would have said that even badly needed [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1098.6200000000001s)]
*  reform would look like what we've seen in the last few days. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1107.7s)]
*  A total dismantling and in the very real sense of shutting down of USAID. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1114.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's the complete eradication of this agency with this 60 year history in hours, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1119.74s)]
*  basically. I mean, I feel like I watched it dissolve in real time. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1127.46s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1137.66s)]
*  Stephanie, I want you to talk about what it has looked like for this agency to be [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1147.5800000000002s)]
*  dissolved, to use your word, and specifically what that has looked like within the [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1153.74s)]
*  health care programs that you have spent all these years covering and that were [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1159.74s)]
*  designed to benefit the United States. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1164.5400000000002s)]
*  Well, let me give you one example. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1166.94s)]
*  I spoke to a scientist named Leila Mansour in South Africa at an HIV research project [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1170.1s)]
*  where I spent a lot of time and she was running a clinical trial to test new ways of [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1175.34s)]
*  trying to prevent HIV. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1179.9s)]
*  And so she had a new experimental ring. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1181.5s)]
*  It's a vaginal ring that women would wear to prevent both pregnancy and infection with [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1184.54s)]
*  HIV. And it's an early stage trial. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1189.5s)]
*  So they're just testing these rings to see if they're comfortable, if they fit, that [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1191.34s)]
*  kind of thing. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1195.3s)]
*  And this testing, it sounds like, is funded by USAID. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1196.26s)]
*  It's funded by USAID. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1199.42s)]
*  And so this researcher, Dr. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1201.54s)]
*  Leila, she gets up one day and she's got this stop work order from Washington. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1204.18s)]
*  It's an order that she do no activities using U.S. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1209.78s)]
*  funds. So that's her USAID grant money that's paying for this clinical trial. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1213.86s)]
*  So she's, in fact, not supposed to have any further communication with these women [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1219.02s)]
*  from the community who are now wearing this experimental ring. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1224.34s)]
*  She's not even supposed to tell them that she's no longer allowed to take care of [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1228.1399999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1232.98s)]
*  Huh. That's how thoroughly the Trump administration wants this all to just come to a [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1233.54s)]
*  halt. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1238.02s)]
*  Yeah. So Dr. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1239.06s)]
*  Leila told me that she couldn't accept that as a doctor, as an ethical scientist. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1240.86s)]
*  And she arranged with her team to bring all of these women immediately into the clinic [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1246.54s)]
*  and to have them remove the rings and collect them and make sure that everybody was [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1251.4199999999998s)]
*  OK and just try to explain to them that the U.S. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1255.9399999999998s)]
*  had suddenly withdrawn its funding and the trial was over. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1259.34s)]
*  And I really wondered listening to her what that felt like for those women. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1263.9399999999998s)]
*  This is a community that I know pretty well where literally generations of people [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1270.86s)]
*  have volunteered their bodies for science. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1277.9399999999998s)]
*  Some of the best HIV treatments and prevention mechanisms we have have been tested on [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1280.94s)]
*  these communities. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1285.58s)]
*  So as you can imagine, there's a real relationship of trust between these people who [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1286.58s)]
*  volunteer and these scientists. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1291.62s)]
*  And so I asked Dr. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1293.38s)]
*  Leila to connect me with someone who'd been in her clinical trial. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1294.82s)]
*  And I spoke to a young woman named Azanda Zondi. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1298.14s)]
*  And she told me about how bizarre it was to just get this phone call that said, come [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1301.5s)]
*  in right away tomorrow morning. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1307.54s)]
*  We're going to take out the ring. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1309.06s)]
*  The trial is over. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1310.1s)]
*  And she told me how she and the other women in the trial were talking to each other [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1311.62s)]
*  saying, like, what do you think has happened? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1315.98s)]
*  And of course, the explanation they've been given is like kind of a non-explanation, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1318.06s)]
*  right? Which leaves you wondering. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1322.42s)]
*  Like, and she said, you know, really fearful. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1324.58s)]
*  And are you being told the whole truth and what's really happening? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1327.18s)]
*  And listening to Dr. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1330.74s)]
*  Leila, like you could see how this relationship of trust that is foundational to the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1332.18s)]
*  kind of scientific research the U.S. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1338.9s)]
*  has wanted to do around the world for years and years is just shattered instantly. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1340.7s)]
*  So the speed and the manner in which the Trump administration is dismantling USAID [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1348.3000000000002s)]
*  means that this medical work in South Africa that has been intended to strengthen [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1355.14s)]
*  ties between the U.S. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1362.6599999999999s)]
*  and the people of South Africa is now dissolved into the situation where they are [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1364.06s)]
*  probably angry and distrustful and fearful. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1370.78s)]
*  This would seem to be the very opposite of the mission of USAID. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1375.4599999999998s)]
*  You know, I think in that one relationship in South Africa, you see a kind of overnight [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1382.1799999999998s)]
*  switch from appreciation to mistrust and fear. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1388.86s)]
*  And I think like writ large, that's what I've seen really in every conversation. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1393.62s)]
*  And, you know, I've had 30 or 40 of them a day for the past couple of weeks where [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1399.1s)]
*  people have gone from deeply, deeply valuing this relationship that has either made [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1404.06s)]
*  their work possible or kept their kids alive or kept them alive to a response that [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1408.9399999999998s)]
*  just feels extraordinarily capricious and cruel and profoundly isolating. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1416.86s)]
*  And so, you know, I guess the thing that really stands out for me is that you could [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1426.8999999999999s)]
*  cut the amount the U.S. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1434.9799999999998s)]
*  spends on foreign aid. You could dramatically change the way the U.S. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1436.26s)]
*  spends money on foreign aid. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1440.2199999999998s)]
*  But it would be very hard to overstate the degree of damage that has been done to those [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1442.1399999999999s)]
*  relationships with individuals and with governments around the world by the events of [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1450.2199999999998s)]
*  the last few days. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1455.1399999999999s)]
*  So, Michael, if, as Stephanie Nolan just explained very clearly, USAID's work, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1456.46s)]
*  generally speaking, advances America's interest overseas with a full awareness of its [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1463.1000000000001s)]
*  potential for bloatedness and wastefulness. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1470.5s)]
*  But if it generally delivers, still, it's a very, very important piece of work. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1473.46s)]
*  And I think that's what makes it so important. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1479.1000000000001s)]
*  I think it's important to think about the extent of its potential for bloatedness and [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1480.8600000000001s)]
*  wastefulness. But if it generally delivers, still, on Kennedy's vision of soft power, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1485.74s)]
*  why, if you were Donald Trump and those around him, eliminate it? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1493.3s)]
*  Well, Michael, Trump and the people around him have never had much interest in the use [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1498.98s)]
*  of soft power. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1504.98s)]
*  He's not about winning friends and influencing people through favors, charity, sweet [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1505.98s)]
*  talk. He likes to apply muscle pressure, threats. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1513.94s)]
*  Some people say bullying. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1518.9s)]
*  So this isn't really part of his playbook. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1521.14s)]
*  And a lot of this work is done in parts of the world about which he's spoken derisively, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1525.06s)]
*  including Africa, where a huge amount of USAID work happens. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1529.18s)]
*  Right. Those were the countries that famously in his first term he referred to as [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1532.8999999999999s)]
*  shithole countries. That's right. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1537.86s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1540.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, another is that USAID was an easy target. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1541.54s)]
*  Explain that. One of Trump's highest priorities, clearly, is really trying to break the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1546.22s)]
*  bureaucracy, trying to purge federal workers, trying to dramatically shrink the size of [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1553.74s)]
*  the American government. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1559.7s)]
*  And, you know, Americans, generally speaking, are very skeptical of foreign aid. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1561.46s)]
*  So I think USAID has almost become a test case or a trial run for Trump's larger plans [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1567.94s)]
*  to smash apart the existing bureaucracy, purge thousands of federal workers and shrink [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1576.7s)]
*  the size of the federal government. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1583.3400000000001s)]
*  What's interesting about the way you're framing this is that it's tempting to see what [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1585.22s)]
*  Trump is doing as first and foremost attacking, dismantling the idea of soft power. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1589.34s)]
*  You're saying that may be incidental to dismantling the federal bureaucracy and that [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1595.02s)]
*  you can't really disentangle the two missions. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1602.4599999999998s)]
*  But I'm still curious why, based on your reporting, the president wants to dismantle [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1606.4599999999998s)]
*  USAID so quickly, so haphazardly in a way that, frankly, pisses so many people across [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1613.46s)]
*  the world off. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1622.2600000000002s)]
*  Well, it's a little bit of a mystery, Michael. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1624.42s)]
*  And I think that we've seen clues to what the answer might be. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1626.18s)]
*  Look at comments that people around Trump have made for years suggesting that you have [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1630.0200000000002s)]
*  to attack the bureaucracy almost mercilessly. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1636.42s)]
*  You have to smash it, knock it down and keep it down before it has a chance to get back [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1640.42s)]
*  up. To people around Trump, the bureaucracy is almost like a movie monster that keeps [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1645.94s)]
*  getting back up. You can't kill it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1651.66s)]
*  And I think that there's a sense that you have to deal a knockout blow quickly before [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1654.18s)]
*  the courts, members of Congress, the unions, all these other factors can come in and start [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1659.6200000000001s)]
*  fighting back. Now, that doesn't mean that USAID has no defenses. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1665.8200000000002s)]
*  The courts are already involved. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1670.1799999999998s)]
*  We'll see what happens. But the strategy, I think, is speed kills. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1672.1s)]
*  The critique of this, I guess the critique of Trump's critique is that this dismantling [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1676.8999999999999s)]
*  of this particular agency, this test case, has real impacts. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1685.26s)]
*  And the impacts are that it may cede a huge amount of ground to our rivals in the world [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1689.9399999999998s)]
*  of soft power, especially China, which has shown enormous enthusiasm for soft power. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1696.42s)]
*  And we've done so many episodes about this. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1702.98s)]
*  China wants to build your new highway. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1704.94s)]
*  China wants to put solar panels on the streetlights so that they work at night in a country [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1707.42s)]
*  with not much electricity. China wants to do almost anything it can to deepen its ties [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1711.66s)]
*  to all these countries where USAID has been doing work. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1717.6200000000001s)]
*  That's right. It's going to create a vacuum. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1721.62s)]
*  And the risk here is that we have circled back to the context that led President Kennedy [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1727.58s)]
*  to create USAID in the early 1960s. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1733.9799999999998s)]
*  John F. Kennedy believed that America was in a global competition for influence with [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1737.82s)]
*  another great power and that USAID was a way to win friends and influence people. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1744.26s)]
*  We are now back at a time where even President Trump and his advisors say the defining [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1752.1399999999999s)]
*  national security threat for America is a global competition for power and influence [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1759.26s)]
*  with another great power. In this case, it's China. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1765.02s)]
*  Right. And to really bring it back to Kennedy, based on everything you're saying, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1767.9799999999998s)]
*  Michael, we're not just at this moment getting rid of USAID and the concept of soft power [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1772.1s)]
*  through Trump's actions. We are replacing it, it would seem, with what you described [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1778.94s)]
*  as Trump's approach to hard power, tariffs and threats. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1785.06s)]
*  And that makes me wonder if we are resuming in that full circle way the version of [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1790.3s)]
*  American foreign policy that existed right before Kennedy created USAID. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1798.8600000000001s)]
*  It's the ugly American approach to foreign policy, perhaps. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1804.54s)]
*  And what is that going to mean for the U.S. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1808.58s)]
*  and the world? Well, that's exactly the concern, Michael. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1811.94s)]
*  And no one is really providing good answers. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1816.1s)]
*  People in the Trump administration just kind of dismiss the idea that China or Russia [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1821.9s)]
*  are going to benefit from this. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1826.86s)]
*  And their critics say they're taking a huge risk and we can't know how it's going to [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1828.34s)]
*  play out. But I think you're exactly right. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1833.86s)]
*  I think the concern is that the ugly American will make a comeback and that will work [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1835.8999999999999s)]
*  to the benefit of our adversaries around the world. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1843.54s)]
*  Well, Michael, thank you very much. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1852.4199999999998s)]
*  We appreciate it. Thanks for having me on. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1853.82s)]
*  On Monday afternoon, the inspector general who oversees USAID issued a report on the [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1855.38s)]
*  impact of the Trump administration's near total shutdown of the agency's operations. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1866.22s)]

*  On Monday, the Trump administration told federal prosecutors to drop sweeping corruption [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1909.94s)]
*  charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has made repeated attempts to curry [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1915.78s)]
*  favor with the new president since his inauguration. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1921.42s)]
*  Adams was indicted for allegedly abusing his power to obtain free travel and for accepting [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1925.5s)]
*  illegal campaign contributions. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1932.3799999999999s)]

*  imported from every U.S. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1957.94s)]
*  trading partner. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1959.98s)]
*  The tariffs are likely to please domestic metalmakers, but significantly increase costs [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1960.98s)]
*  for U.S. companies that make items like cars, planes and food packaging. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzwsc3XGNA&t=1967.8600000000001s)]
