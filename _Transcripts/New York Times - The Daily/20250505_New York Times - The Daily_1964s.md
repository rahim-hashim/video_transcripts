# You Have Questions About the Economy. We Have Answers.
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8)
*  Hi, Michael and everyone at The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=3.96s)]
*  Hey. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=4.96s)]
*  Hi, Daily. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=5.96s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=6.96s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=7.96s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=9.76s)]
*  I had a quick question about Trump's tariff policies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=10.76s)]
*  I have so many questions. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=13.44s)]
*  I'm struggling to choose priority. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=15.24s)]
*  At a time of enormous economic upheaval and uncertainty triggered by President Trump's [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=18.6s)]
*  We asked you, our listeners, what you want to understand about this financial moment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=25.72s)]
*  How many American businesses will even survive this? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  What can actually be done to bring down the cost of goods? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=34.44s)]
*  No matter how big. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=38.4s)]
*  The first thing is whether or not the American dream is feasible in the next coming years. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=39.4s)]
*  What can I do to prepare for uncertain catastrophe? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=43.16s)]
*  Or small. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=47.56s)]
*  How will this affect Parmesan cheese? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=48.8s)]
*  I love Parmesan cheese. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=51.16s)]
*  Today, my colleague, Chief Economics Correspondent Ben Castleman, tries to answer those questions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=54.76s)]
*  Please help me understand. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=62.68s)]
*  Are we going to be okay? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=64.24s)]
*  The people need answers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=65.6s)]
*  It's Monday, May 5th. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=73.12s)]
*  Ben, always a pleasure. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=76.12s)]
*  Michael, thanks for having me. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=85.48s)]
*  You know, we're going to do something a little bit different here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=86.48s)]
*  I hear it's not just us that we'll be hearing today. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=89.64s)]
*  No, not just us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  And I think a little backstory is in order. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  We came to you, as we do, with some, I suspect, annoying frequency, to ask you how to think [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=98.28s)]
*  about the economy. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=104.72s)]
*  And when we talked to you last week, you said, sure, there's a ton going on in the economy [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=106.12s)]
*  because of everything that President Trump has done to the economy, but that just looking [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=111.64s)]
*  at the raw data, nothing much has changed since we last spoke with you, maybe a couple [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=116.92s)]
*  weeks ago. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=121.28s)]
*  But everyone we know is feeling something very acute in their financial lives. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=123.0s)]
*  And it felt like we needed to listen to that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=129.36s)]
*  And we thought, what if we hand our microphone to our listeners and just acknowledge how [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=132.52s)]
*  many people have questions and anxieties, worries, concerns that they want to get answers [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=137.4s)]
*  to? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=144.0s)]
*  I love this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=145.0s)]
*  And I have to say, I hear all the time recently from friends, from family, from long lost [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=146.0s)]
*  acquaintances who are asking me these kinds of questions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=151.96s)]
*  And we're all spending our time asking these questions, because like you say, it's not [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=154.94s)]
*  that clear in the data yet, but clearly something is happening and we're all trying to figure [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  it out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=164.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=165.0s)]
*  So we put a call out to our listeners for their questions and they showed up in force. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=166.0s)]
*  Hello, my name is Elliot Yeager. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=170.56s)]
*  I am 22 and I'm living in Boston, Massachusetts. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=172.84s)]
*  I'm 29 years old and I live in Houston, Texas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=176.56s)]
*  I'm 67 and live in White River Junction, Vermont. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=179.24s)]
*  I am 55 and I live in California. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=182.52s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds of questions. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=186.08s)]
*  From Indianapolis, Indiana. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=187.44s)]
*  From New Orleans, Louisiana. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=189.28s)]
*  From Olympia, Washington. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Came our way in the form of voice memos. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  It's not going to surprise you to hear that a lot of those questions revolve around tariffs. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm not surprised we're getting these questions and I will do my best. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=200.76s)]
*  But frankly, the policies have been changing at such a speed that I don't know if by the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  time listeners hear this, we won't have had another round of changes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=209.2s)]
*  So I will do my darnedest, but bear with me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=213.76s)]
*  Caveat accepted. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=219.56s)]
*  I want to start with a question that I think really encapsulates listeners' curiosities [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  around the tariffs. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=228.12s)]
*  Hi, New York Times. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=230.12s)]
*  My name is Sarah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=231.16s)]
*  I'm 27 years old, living in Saginaw, Michigan. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=232.12s)]
*  My husband and I are expecting our first baby in October. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=235.68s)]
*  My question today pertains to tariffs. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=239.2s)]
*  Is there anything that new expecting parents can do to prepare? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=241.72s)]
*  I'm worried about not having supplies for my baby. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=245.76s)]
*  Empty shelves and the cost of goods greatly increasing, especially those from China. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=248.56s)]
*  What do you have to say besides Mazel Tov? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=255.0s)]
*  I was going to say, first of all, congratulations. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, we normally think of tariffs as being mostly about higher prices, and they [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=260.12s)]
*  are for sure. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=265.56s)]
*  But they can also be about the availability of goods. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=267.52s)]
*  And when we talk about goods from China in particular, right now, President Trump has [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=271.4s)]
*  imposed 145 percent tariffs on products from China. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=277.0s)]
*  And you talk to some businesses. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=281.84s)]
*  I talked to a toy manufacturer recently who said at a certain point, 145, 150, he said [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=283.88s)]
*  a billion percent. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=290.08s)]
*  It doesn't matter. I cannot pay that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=291.92s)]
*  And so there are certain things that just may not come in. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=295.08s)]
*  Baby goods are a prime example of this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=297.56s)]
*  A ton of our strollers and cribs and other baby equipment comes from China. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=300.52s)]
*  And a lot of that is not going to come. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=307.32s)]
*  Now, look, eventually, right, people will figure out workarounds. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=308.96s)]
*  It's not like no crib will ever enter this country again. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=312.76s)]
*  But, you know, babies famously come on a timeline. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=315.64s)]
*  Sarah, I'm ahead of time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=319.0s)]
*  Sarah can't presumably just say, you know, never mind, we'll get the crib sometime next [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=320.28s)]
*  year. And so this is a situation where really the idea of trying to get something now [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=324.44s)]
*  before the tariffs make it impossible to get at any price is something I think we're [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=330.12s)]
*  going to see a lot of people starting to think about. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=334.88s)]
*  I think a reasonable question and it's implied in Sarah's question is, is it OK to kind [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=337.96s)]
*  of panic by now? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=343.28s)]
*  We all know what happens when lots and lots of people decide to do that collectively at [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=345.52s)]
*  the same time. That's what happened during the pandemic. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=349.52s)]
*  It can actually be pretty counterproductive and yet entirely, in this case, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  understandable. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=356.4s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, we saw in the pandemic how complicated supply chains are, how [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=357.92s)]
*  small disruptions can filter through in unexpected ways. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=363.36s)]
*  Look, I don't think you need to rush out and buy a year's worth of socks right now, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  necessarily. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=372.36s)]
*  But it's probably not a bad idea to buy a crib. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=373.24s)]
*  You know, look, cautious about giving specific advice to a specific person. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=375.68s)]
*  But yeah, I don't think it's crazy to say I better place that order for the crib now, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  even though I'm not going to need it for a little bit. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=383.92s)]
*  How likely are empty shelves? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=385.76s)]
*  I believe that both Wal-Mart and Target have found a way to warn the White House that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  that could be a thing, not totally empty shelves, but [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=392.16s)]
*  not really full shelves either if the tariffs against China remain in place. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=396.76s)]
*  Well, we heard President Trump functionally acknowledge that recently when he talked [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=401.32s)]
*  about you may go to the store at Christmas, at the holidays, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=405.76s)]
*  and the toys you want to buy may not be there. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=410.72s)]
*  They may cost a lot more. There may be fewer presents under the tree this year. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=413.56s)]
*  That is not the normal political messaging. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=417.72s)]
*  For most goods, we're going to be talking about higher prices rather than just lack [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=421.48s)]
*  of availability. But a huge percentage of our toys [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  come from China. You could easily see a situation where some toys are simply not [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=430.12s)]
*  available or not available in nearly the numbers that we would expect this fall. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=434.28s)]
*  Let's turn to a set of questions we got about housing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  Hi, this is Anna. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  Hi, this is Lucy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=444.64s)]
*  My name is Mike. I'm 55 years old, live in San Antonio, Texas. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=446.2s)]
*  And my question is how or if tariffs will affect [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=449.52s)]
*  U.S. interest rates and building supply costs? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=454.11999999999995s)]
*  My wife and I are considering constructing a new home on a piece of property that we [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=458.11999999999995s)]
*  own. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=462.64s)]
*  I saved enough money to pay for a down payment on a house. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=463.52s)]
*  What could happen with interest rates if there's a chance they might go down or if [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=468.64s)]
*  they could even go up in the next couple of years? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=471.76s)]
*  But with the economy where it is, is that a crazy thing to do right now? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=473.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=479.4s)]
*  A lot of our listeners, and I frankly didn't expect this, asked questions about what [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=480.67999999999995s)]
*  the trade war and all that economic disruption means for buying a home. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think people are intuiting that tariffs could increase inflation. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=491.2s)]
*  And they know from you, Ben, and your many appearances on this show, that when [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  inflation gets higher and higher, the tool that the government uses to bring it [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=498.76s)]
*  down is that they raise interest rates, which raises the cost of that 30 year [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=503.23999999999995s)]
*  mortgage. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=507.92s)]
*  And therefore, the question really becomes, do tariffs of the kind that are now in [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  place almost ensure a costlier housing market down the line? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=513.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=518.64s)]
*  So let's take a quick step back here about how we got here with housing. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=518.76s)]
*  It was hard to buy a house before the pandemic, but then housing prices just soared [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=523.28s)]
*  during and immediately after the pandemic, right? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=528.88s)]
*  Everybody rushing out to get more space. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=531.08s)]
*  Interest rates were super low. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=533.08s)]
*  Then all of a sudden we get inflation, interest rates soar. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=535.12s)]
*  So that makes it even harder to buy a home. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=538.84s)]
*  And the hope coming into this year was this would finally be the year that things [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=541.64s)]
*  sort of started to settle down a little bit and the housing market could start to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=546.6s)]
*  get back to some kind of normal. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=550.76s)]
*  That is just not what we're seeing. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=553.36s)]
*  So first of all, mortgage rates have not come down. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=555.88s)]
*  They're still hanging out around 7%. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=559.5600000000001s)]
*  That's pretty high. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=561.5600000000001s)]
*  It's really high. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=562.52s)]
*  And there's no sign for exactly the reasons that you're talking about that they're [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=563.48s)]
*  going to come down significantly anytime soon, right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=567.88s)]
*  If tariffs drive up inflation, the Fed is going to have a hard time cutting interest [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=571.9200000000001s)]
*  rates. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=576.44s)]
*  That's going to keep mortgage rates higher. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=577.24s)]
*  Also, tariffs are going to directly hit the cost of building a home. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=579.6s)]
*  We're talking about lumber that comes in from Canada. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=584.32s)]
*  We're talking about appliances that come in from China. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=587.84s)]
*  We're also talking about maybe less labor supply if we deport a lot of immigrant [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=591.12s)]
*  workers who work in construction. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=595.64s)]
*  So there are a lot of reasons that the cost of building a home is going to be higher [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=597.72s)]
*  and therefore the supply of homes is going to be lower. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  And so it could be a really tough time to buy a home. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=605.64s)]
*  That down payment that Anna saved up may not go as far as she had been counting. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=609.36s)]
*  We've been talking about big purchasing decisions. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=615.24s)]
*  For a lot of people, the tariffs have raised this bigger existential question about [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=617.9599999999999s)]
*  whether they're going to have a job and what all of this means for the job market. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  I want to play some of those questions. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=628.68s)]
*  I am 40 years old and I have an MBA and I can't find a job and I'm not alone. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=630.2399999999999s)]
*  I'm not really sure what's going on with the job market. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=640.0s)]
*  I keep hearing the phrase the job market is just really tough right now. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=644.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure many people in my same position could relate. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=647.2s)]
*  Why is it so hard for me to get a job even though I have all the things I've been [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=650.48s)]
*  told my whole life I need to get a job. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=653.8000000000001s)]
*  With everything going on right now, what does the job market look like for those of [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=656.24s)]
*  us graduating college within the next year or so? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=660.4000000000001s)]
*  What can you tell us about the job market? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=663.76s)]
*  And I really want to make sure we acknowledge that final question about folks just [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=665.76s)]
*  coming into the market. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=669.48s)]
*  So I hear this a lot from people right now. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=670.76s)]
*  And at first it might sound a little surprising when I say by some measures the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=673.84s)]
*  job market looks pretty good right now. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=679.4s)]
*  The unemployment rate is low. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=681.96s)]
*  We hear about some high profile layoffs, but layoffs in the aggregate are still [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=684.6s)]
*  pretty infrequent. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=690.04s)]
*  And so if you have a job right now, at least at this moment, it looks like things [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=691.84s)]
*  are kind of OK. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=698.08s)]
*  What we also know is that it's a hard time to be looking for a job. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=699.6s)]
*  And I think that's what these listeners are getting at. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=703.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=706.48s)]
*  So a lot of it has to do with this uncertainty that we're in right now. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=707.48s)]
*  Companies are trying to figure out what's happening in the economy and where things [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=712.24s)]
*  are going. They're not in such bad shape that they're cutting jobs, but they're [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=717.0s)]
*  also very reluctant to hire. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=721.48s)]
*  And so it's this sort of stagnant labor market where if you're trying to get that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=724.4s)]
*  foot in the door or you're trying to get that next step up in your career, it could [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=730.32s)]
*  be really tough because all of these businesses are out there just saying, let's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=734.84s)]
*  hold off and see where things are. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=739.5600000000001s)]
*  We'll touch base again in a few months. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  If the tariffs were to settle into a more permanent seeming dynamic, would that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=743.32s)]
*  uncertainty start to dissolve and could hiring start to go up? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=749.44s)]
*  Or is the reality that a settled tariff situation is probably going to lead to higher [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=753.88s)]
*  costs for businesses and therefore that won't be the case? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=758.4s)]
*  So it depends a little bit on what we're talking about when we talk about tariffs, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=762.5600000000001s)]
*  right? If we talk about one hundred and forty five percent tariffs on everybody, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=765.5600000000001s)]
*  that's going to be a very bad situation for a lot of companies. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=768.6800000000001s)]
*  But yeah, the uncertainty is a really big issue here. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  On some level, businesses can navigate a difficult environment if they know what it [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=774.24s)]
*  is that they're going to be facing and they can make appropriate decisions. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=779.24s)]
*  But when you don't know when one day the tariffs are on, the next they're off, one [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=783.4s)]
*  day they're on China, but not on Europe, the next day maybe that flips. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=788.0s)]
*  And it's not just tariffs, right? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=792.08s)]
*  It's everything we're hearing around federal job cuts and doge. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=793.56s)]
*  It's everything, the uncertainty around immigration policy. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=797.32s)]
*  All of this makes it difficult for companies to make decisions. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=800.04s)]
*  And so a lot of companies are on hold. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=803.76s)]
*  One possibility, right, is we eventually get some certainty and companies start [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=805.68s)]
*  hiring again. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=809.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=810.6s)]
*  But there's another very real possibility, which is that eventually they do start [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=811.0s)]
*  cutting jobs. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=815.16s)]
*  If we see these tariffs hit, if we see consumers pull back, if we see a real slowdown [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=816.24s)]
*  in the economy, companies won't be on hold anymore. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=823.2800000000001s)]
*  They'll be cutting jobs and we'll see unemployment rise. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=825.84s)]
*  OK, on that note, Ben, we're going to take a break. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=830.48s)]
*  And when we come back, we're going to answer a bunch of questions we got about what [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=832.88s)]
*  all of this means for the stock market, for people's retirement accounts, their [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=837.2s)]
*  college savings accounts and their general sense of financial well-being. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=842.28s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=851.8s)]
*  Hi to the team at The Daily. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=872.28s)]
*  Thanks for taking my question. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=874.0s)]
*  My name is Hannah. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=875.68s)]

*  My name is May. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=884.76s)]

*  As an American in my early 30s, I'm wondering what should I be doing to protect myself [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=893.0s)]
*  and build a secure future for my family? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  Should I be increasing my 401k contribution and buying up as much stock as I can? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=899.88s)]
*  Is the priority to save money or pay off debt first? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=906.32s)]
*  I just qualified to apply for a 401k with my company. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=909.32s)]
*  I've never had a 401k before, and I'm wondering, is this a good time to open my [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=912.96s)]
*  401k account because prices are so low? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=918.0400000000001s)]
*  My dad used to work in finance and I feel like he would disown me if he knew we [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  weren't really investing right now because historically, we didn't have that much [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=923.9200000000001s)]
*  investing right now because historically, over time, despite any bumps and bruises [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=927.92s)]
*  along the way, the stock market goes up. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=932.4s)]
*  But I'm just not so sure anymore. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=935.3199999999999s)]
*  What if that trend is over? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=938.2s)]
*  Ben, first of all, those are great questions. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=944.08s)]
*  And I think a lot of them are touching on the theme of volatility in the stock market [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=946.88s)]
*  in this moment. Now, whenever we talk about the stock market, I feel like I have to [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=952.12s)]
*  repeat what they say in all the ads. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=956.36s)]
*  Trading stocks involves a significant risk of loss. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=958.12s)]
*  It's not suitable for everyone. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=960.28s)]
*  Past success is not an indicator of future performance. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=961.76s)]
*  And we are not, of course, been asking you to give financial advice about the stock [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=964.8s)]
*  market. But how broadly speaking do you think about the choice facing some of [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=969.4s)]
*  these listeners about whether to try to potentially profit from the market's [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=974.68s)]
*  swings right now or sitting tight and waiting out these swings in the market? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=980.8s)]
*  So, yeah, I'm definitely not a financial adviser and I'm definitely not in a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  position to tell anybody specifically what to do. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=991.52s)]
*  But, look, I think you're right that that is underlying a lot of these questions. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=993.64s)]
*  And it's interesting to me, right, a lot of those questions sounded like they were [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=998.12s)]
*  coming from people in their 30s, even younger than that. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1001.3199999999999s)]
*  If you're in your 20s, if you're in your 30s, you've mostly experienced a stock [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  market that has been rising. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1009.44s)]
*  You've had some dips along the way, but it bounces back relatively quickly. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1012.12s)]
*  And, you know, we hear, buy the dip, right? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1016.2800000000001s)]
*  Stocks fall like, great, they're on sale. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1018.6800000000001s)]
*  Let's buy them up and profit from it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1020.44s)]
*  That's worked out pretty well over the last few years. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1022.24s)]
*  It doesn't always work that way. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1024.68s)]
*  Right. Stocks historically have gone up over time. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1026.48s)]
*  But over time is a really important caveat there. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1030.2s)]
*  The standard financial advice is don't put money into the stock market that you [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1035.52s)]
*  need in the next couple of years and put money in that you can afford to risk. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1040.8s)]
*  And don't try to time the market. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1047.12s)]
*  If you're sitting here saying like, should I start my 401k? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  Start your 401k. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1053.76s)]
*  We heard from folks who are in the unique position of having saved up a good amount [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1056.48s)]
*  of money for their children's higher education in something like a 529 [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1064.48s)]
*  educational savings account and discovered that this is the moment they need it. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1070.8s)]
*  And that because of the trade war, the stock market has gone down. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1075.84s)]
*  And I want to play you a question from one of those listeners. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1080.16s)]
*  Hi, Michael. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1083.4s)]
*  My name is Tracy Church and I live in Louisville, Kentucky, and I'm a single [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1084.44s)]
*  mother. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1090.52s)]
*  I'm a healthcare worker. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1091.08s)]
*  I had saved enough for my daughter to go to a four year institution. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1093.4s)]
*  She graduates next week from high school. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, I worked my tail off to get money set aside for her. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1103.76s)]
*  And I took a look at two of the 529s that I had for her and they had decreased [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  dramatically because of Trump and the tariffs and everything. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1116.0400000000002s)]
*  And it's just heartbreaking. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1122.1200000000001s)]
*  And my question about the economy is how bad is this going to affect our kids' [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1125.0800000000002s)]
*  college funds? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1131.4s)]
*  Thanks for listening. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1133.2800000000002s)]
*  What do you have to say to Tracy? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1134.7600000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's a tough situation and I think it's a reminder. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1137.24s)]
*  You know, we sometimes say the stock market isn't the economy. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1142.0800000000002s)]
*  It mostly affects rich people. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1145.24s)]
*  You know, most of us have money in retirement savings, in college savings, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1147.64s)]
*  right? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1153.44s)]
*  There are real consequences to what happens in the stock market, not only for [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1153.6s)]
*  rich people. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1157.52s)]
*  I will say, I don't know when Tracy looked at her 529 account, but there was a [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1158.96s)]
*  moment when the market was way, way down. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1164.48s)]
*  I think it was off 20%. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1167.2s)]
*  Yeah, it was, it was, you know, brutal. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1168.32s)]
*  It has come back up since that sum. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1170.84s)]
*  I make no prediction about where it goes, but it may be worth Tracy's while to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1174.64s)]
*  take a look and see where things are now because you don't necessarily have to [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1178.8s)]
*  keep all that money in the stock market, right? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1183.76s)]
*  You can keep it within that 529 plan and put it into something a little bit [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1186.0s)]
*  safer, which if she needs the money soon, could be a safer bet. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  But I think that the larger point here is this is painful. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1194.2s)]
*  These are real consequences and not everybody has the luxury of just saying, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1198.44s)]
*  oh, if we wait a while, things will get better. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1203.1599999999999s)]
*  We've heard a lot from the president about, oh, short term pain is going to [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1207.12s)]
*  yield some sort of long term gain. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1211.12s)]
*  But if your kid's going to college today, if your baby is due in a few months, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1214.04s)]
*  right, you can't necessarily plan your life for the long term. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's a real pain point that a lot of people are going to be experiencing. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1222.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1226.2s)]
*  Ben, despite how worried so many of our listeners are about what tariffs are [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1227.24s)]
*  going to mean for cost, product availability, car purchasing, home [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1231.88s)]
*  purchasing, job market, a fair number of folks asked us what it would be like [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1236.68s)]
*  for the tariffs to accomplish what the president has said that he thinks they [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1243.8000000000002s)]
*  could, which is to bring back domestic manufacturing. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1248.4s)]
*  Now here, I know you, you're about to tell me that mainstream economists of [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1251.5200000000002s)]
*  all political stripes have a lot of doubts that tariffs can bring back [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1257.12s)]
*  domestic manufacturing. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1263.28s)]
*  But I think what listeners are trying to understand is what would be the [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  impacts of a renewed U.S. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1268.56s)]
*  manufacturing base? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I would go further. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1273.52s)]
*  I don't think it's just that mainstream economists have doubts. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1274.44s)]
*  I would say virtually all economists are beyond skeptical to the point of sort [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1277.3999999999999s)]
*  of dismissing the possibility that tariffs, at least as they're being [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1283.56s)]
*  imposed here, could have that effect. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1288.24s)]
*  It's not clear that even if you brought back manufacturing production, it [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1290.28s)]
*  would bring back, A, that many jobs, because there's a lot of automation, or [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1293.88s)]
*  B, that the jobs would be all that good. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1298.1200000000001s)]
*  I think the skepticism comes from the idea that these policies could [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1301.68s)]
*  actually achieve those ends. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1306.3600000000001s)]
*  Because they've actually made the cost of bringing manufacturing back so high. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1309.32s)]
*  You've said that to us in the past. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1316.12s)]
*  Business folks are basically telling you the current tariff scheme introduced by [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1317.1999999999998s)]
*  Trump is an impediment to bringing manufacturing back. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1321.4399999999998s)]
*  Because you can't turn this around on a dime. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1325.24s)]
*  It takes time to build a factory. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1326.8799999999999s)]
*  It takes time to reorient supply chains. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1328.1999999999998s)]
*  Right now, even a factory here is probably using goods that are brought in from [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1331.1599999999999s)]
*  overseas. That can't change overnight. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1334.76s)]
*  Rather, they're just going to end up shutting down a lot of manufacturers. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1336.68s)]
*  Ben, as we come to the end of the conversation, I want to acknowledge that [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1339.96s)]
*  a big thread running through a lot of the questions we got was an even deeper [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1344.2s)]
*  worry about what might happen. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1351.16s)]
*  And a lot of people named it the R word. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1354.0800000000002s)]
*  Let me play you some of those questions. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1358.1200000000001s)]
*  Hi, my name is Holly. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1361.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm 19 and I'm from New Jersey. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1362.96s)]
*  And I keep seeing things online about recession indicators, some serious and some [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1365.5200000000002s)]
*  jokes all relating to the tariffs. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1371.88s)]
*  And I guess my question is whether all this widespread talk about a recession would [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1374.72s)]
*  affect demand and actually worsen our probability of a recession actually occurring. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1382.7600000000002s)]
*  Good morning. My name is Cynthia Janzora. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1389.64s)]
*  Now, seeing the way the stock market is seesawing, we are terrified. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1393.88s)]
*  Is a recession coming? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1401.64s)]
*  Therefore, keep our money close to the pocket and not spend it whatsoever. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1403.0s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1409.8s)]
*  Hi, New York Times. My name is Molly. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1412.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm a 25 year old teacher from Chicago. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1413.96s)]
*  And all I've been hearing about and reading about from various news agencies is that [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1415.92s)]
*  pretty much every economist thinks that we are headed for a recession. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1420.6s)]
*  So one, are we going into recession? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1423.3999999999999s)]
*  Two, what are the indicators of how bad it is going to be? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1426.0s)]
*  And three, what can we do to keep it from being as disastrous as the one back in 2008? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1428.6s)]
*  So how likely is a recession to be at this moment? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1434.3999999999999s)]
*  And how likely is something potentially even worse than just a recession? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1440.32s)]
*  So I would say, first of all, I don't think a recession is inevitable. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1444.84s)]
*  For one thing, these policies could be reversed again. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  We've already seen a lot of back and forth. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1453.68s)]
*  It's not clear. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1455.6000000000001s)]
*  A deal could be reached with China. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1456.0s)]
*  A deal could be reached with China. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1456.8000000000002s)]
*  It's not clear where things will end up. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1457.76s)]
*  It's not clear that these tariffs would inevitably lead to a recession on their own. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1460.24s)]
*  I think they're clearly going to lead to higher prices. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1465.3200000000002s)]
*  They're clearly going to lead to slower growth. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1467.24s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily translate into a full blown recession. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1469.0s)]
*  And most of the economists that I talk to say that if there is a recession, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1473.2s)]
*  it has the potential to be a comparatively mild one. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1477.72s)]
*  This isn't 2008 where we have this huge housing bubble that's then going to collapse. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1481.12s)]
*  It's not a global pandemic in the same way. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1486.36s)]
*  So there's some optimism for you. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1490.04s)]
*  Now, let me undermine it. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1493.24s)]
*  I would say a couple of things. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1495.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, one, even a mild recession is really painful for a lot of people. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1496.76s)]
*  If you lose your job, there can be long term consequences from that. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1500.92s)]
*  It also seems like there are some things about this potential recession or even [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  potential slowdown that could be tougher than some in the past. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1509.1599999999999s)]
*  This combination of higher prices and slower growth is a really tough [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1512.72s)]
*  combination to navigate. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1517.84s)]
*  And it's also not clear that there's going to be a lot of help there. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  If you think back to 2008 and 2009, or you think back to the pandemic, we had [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1523.36s)]
*  enhanced unemployment benefits and we had checks that went out to people. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1528.48s)]
*  It's not clear that a lot of that help is going to be there this time around. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1532.8s)]
*  And then there are the bigger risks that are hard to quantify and hard to be sure [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1536.76s)]
*  about, but we've seen some real turmoil in the financial markets over the past [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1540.92s)]
*  several weeks, fears of what's happening in the bond market, fears of what's [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1546.04s)]
*  happening with the dollar. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1549.88s)]
*  But I think there are real questions that are being asked about sort of the long [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1551.48s)]
*  term stability of the financial system of the US economy, the US's place in the [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1554.48s)]
*  global economy. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1559.04s)]
*  And it's hard to predict where that goes, but at a minimum, you've got to be [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1560.76s)]
*  concerned that we could be sowing the seeds of some much deeper long run [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1565.48s)]
*  problems that could show up in unpredictable and potentially pretty [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1569.6399999999999s)]
*  disastrous ways down the road. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1574.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1576.2s)]
*  You can't use the word disastrous without telling me what you mean. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1576.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, if you look at what the president has done in his first months in [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1579.84s)]
*  office, he's picked fights, not just with adversaries, but with allies. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  He's called into question fundamental alliances, military and economic. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1587.52s)]
*  He has at least floated questions about Fed independence, about the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1594.28s)]
*  sanctity of the treasury market. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1601.3200000000002s)]
*  There are a lot of hard to pin down, but worrying questions that we're seeing [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1603.0800000000002s)]
*  are leading investors, they're leading leaders of other countries to start to [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1610.16s)]
*  think twice about the role that the US is playing. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  And I know that this sort of sounds a little bit esoteric. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1619.44s)]
*  I know that this sounds a little bit hard to pin down and it is hard to pin down. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1623.08s)]
*  I can't sit here and give you a super specific scenario about what this looks [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1628.44s)]
*  like, but the bedrock of the global financial system for decades now has [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1634.6399999999999s)]
*  been that the US is the world's strongest and most solid economy, that it pays its [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1640.36s)]
*  debts, that it meets its obligations. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1647.08s)]
*  And I don't want to say that that is no longer true, but we have certainly seen [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1650.32s)]
*  some cracks in the confidence in that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1656.76s)]
*  On the other hand, one of the realities of an unpredictable moment and an [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1660.28s)]
*  unpredictable administration is that we could also be looking at a scenario in [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1666.1999999999998s)]
*  which the tariffs get peeled back. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1670.0s)]
*  The stock market starts to inch up, gets back to where it was when Trump took [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1674.48s)]
*  office and confidence in the US financial system remains relatively high [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1679.88s)]
*  and ultimately unblemished. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1686.92s)]
*  So I think it is definitely the case that a lot of the economic damage is still [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1689.2s)]
*  sort of fresh enough that a lot of it could be reversed. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1694.24s)]
*  I mean, indeed, a lot of it hasn't even shown up in the economic data yet. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1696.96s)]
*  I do think that there are questions about some of the longer run damage that may [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1700.48s)]
*  have already been done, especially when it comes to just business confidence. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1704.56s)]
*  If the president comes out next week and says, never mind about the tariffs, I'm [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1710.4s)]
*  not sure that CEOs are all going to say, well, I guess we're fine then. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1715.6s)]
*  I think that there are real questions about, well, could the tariffs be back [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1720.76s)]
*  again a week later? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1723.6s)]
*  Like if you can't trust that the rules are the rules, that makes things difficult. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1725.16s)]
*  And so on the one hand, yes, I don't think a recession is baked in. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1730.2s)]
*  I don't think that the die is cast, but I also am not sure we can say everything [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1734.0s)]
*  can just return absolutely to normal. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1740.24s)]
*  I do think that we have already seen real changes that are not just going to disappear. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1743.28s)]
*  Well, thank you, Ben. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1754.2s)]
*  On behalf of all of our listeners, we appreciate it. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1755.28s)]
*  These are great questions. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1759.24s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1760.4399999999998s)]
*  On Friday afternoon, U.S. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1769.6799999999998s)]
*  stocks led by the S&P 500 erased the deep losses that they suffered in the days [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1771.52s)]
*  after President Trump ruled out his tariffs on April 2nd. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1777.8s)]
*  But the increase in stock prices comes despite warnings that the tariffs could [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1782.0s)]
*  spark a recession. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1786.7199999999998s)]
*  And it's unclear what the next few days and weeks of trading will ultimately bring. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1788.36s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1798.8799999999999s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1814.9599999999998s)]
*  Your secretary of state says everyone who's here, citizens and non-citizens, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1817.44s)]
*  deserve due process. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1821.16s)]
*  Do you agree, Mr. President? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1822.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1823.4s)]
*  I'm not a lawyer. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1824.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1826.0s)]
*  Well, the Fifth Amendment says so much. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1827.04s)]
*  It seems it might say that. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1828.76s)]
*  In an interview with NBC broadcast on Sunday, President Trump questioned whether [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1831.92s)]
*  every person on American soil was entitled to due process, something the Fifth [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1837.28s)]
*  Amendment guarantees, and said that he did not know whether it was his job as [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1842.8799999999999s)]
*  president to uphold the Constitution. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1848.0s)]
*  Don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1851.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1853.8799999999999s)]
*  I have to respond by saying again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me and [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1855.3999999999999s)]
*  they are going to... [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1861.6399999999999s)]
*  The exchanges help explain the administration's aggressive approach to deportations [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1862.28s)]
*  and its decision to ignore a Supreme Court ruling to facilitate the return of [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1867.56s)]
*  a migrant living in Maryland who was mistakenly sent to a prison in El Salvador [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1872.76s)]
*  without due process. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1877.8799999999999s)]
*  And a forthcoming book reports that before President Joe Biden was forced to quit [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1880.68s)]
*  his campaign for reelection, his aides debated having him undergo a cognitive [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1887.12s)]
*  test to prove his fitness for a second term. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1892.72s)]
*  But those aides ultimately decided against the idea. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1896.68s)]
*  The account highlights the degree to which Biden's own aides worried about his age [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1901.32s)]
*  and mental acuity, even as they publicly supported Biden's decision to seek a [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RNcoCEe6z8&t=1907.08s)]
