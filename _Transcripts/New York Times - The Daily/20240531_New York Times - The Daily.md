# Guilty
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_athdgh2nc)
*  And we are starting with breaking news this hour.
*  You're looking live at the courthouse where we have word that the jury has reached a verdict
*  in former president Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial.
*  We are standing in front of the municipal courthouse in lower Manhattan.
*  It's 514 and I have just hoofed it over here from my apartment because we got word about
*  25 minutes ago that this jury, after just a day and a half, has reached a verdict in
*  the hush money case of former president Trump.
*  Behind me are a huge number of demonstrators who have gone quiet.
*  The verdicts are starting to be read one by one.
*  And so far, according to our colleagues who are in the room, they are guilty, guilty,
*  guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.
*  Every single one of the counts, remember there are 34, are guilty.
*  And just to make it official, from the New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro.
*  This is the daily.
*  Donald J. Trump, former president of the United States, has become the first president to
*  be convicted of a crime.
*  And it's absolutely no overstatement, a historic moment.
*  It's, by the time you hear this, going to be Friday, May 31st.
*  Jonah Bromwich.
*  How's it going, Michael?
*  It's good.
*  You okay?
*  Yeah, I mean, I should ask you, how's it going, Jonah?
*  I'm okay.
*  Yeah, you've got that glow of...
*  Post-trial glow, it's over.
*  Jonah, I want you to take us inside the courtroom for the moment of this historic verdict, and
*  then we'll talk about why this was the ultimate verdict.
*  But just start by setting the scene in the room.
*  There were no cameras, as has been the case throughout this trial.
*  So be our camera for this final day.
*  You got it.
*  So let's rewind just a little bit before the verdict, back to 4.15 p.m.
*  Because around 4.15 p.m., the prosecutors have come into the courtroom, as has Donald
*  Trump, and the judge gets up on the bench and he says something a little confusing,
*  which is that he is planning to dismiss the jury at 4.30 p.m.
*  So immediately I see tweets starting to go up, no verdict today.
*  There's kind of a release of tension in the courtroom to some extent.
*  But 4.30 comes and this very punctual judge is not there.
*  And then another minute passes, another minute passes, and then the judge comes back in the
*  courtroom and he gets on the bench and what he says is, at 4.20 p.m., five minutes after
*  he had previously addressed us, the jury had sent him a note and the note had said that
*  they had a verdict.
*  So the tension rushes right back in.
*  And sure enough, about a half an hour later, the jury files in.
*  One juror looks at Trump.
*  She already knows what's going to happen in a second, but the former president does not.
*  And they go to their seats and the foreman stands up and he confirms to the judge that
*  they do in fact have a verdict.
*  And then it all happens very, very quickly.
*  He's suddenly being asked how they found the defendant on the first count.
*  The foreman, without any hesitation, in a flat voice says, guilty.
*  And he says guilty on the second count.
*  He says guilty on the third count.
*  And he is going really, really fast.
*  So we are hearing Donald Trump transformed into a felon and then hit with a second, a
*  third, a fourth, a fifth, eventually a 34th felony count on which he has been found guilty
*  by a jury of 12 New Yorkers in the span of two minutes.
*  So think about that for a second.
*  34 counts over the span of two minutes.
*  It went by really quickly.
*  It's almost like a bell ringing in that room.
*  Guilty.
*  Guilty.
*  Guilty.
*  What is Trump's reaction?
*  I didn't have a perfect view of Trump.
*  I was frantically entering the guilty pleas into our live blog.
*  But I interviewed someone who did, one of the sketch artists who's been there day in,
*  day out during the trial.
*  She had a great view of Trump.
*  She said that when the convictions started raining down on him, he closed his eyes and
*  then he shook his head and mouthed the word no.
*  And by the end of the recitation, he's kind of slumped back in his seat, slack, kind of
*  all the air has gone out of him.
*  And it's over.
*  He's been convicted.
*  The judge thanks the jury for their service.
*  He thanks them profusely.
*  And then he seems almost as if he's about to leave the judge.
*  But then he asks about Trump's bail status, meaning is Trump going to be imprisoned or
*  not?
*  And there is no bail status set.
*  And he releases him on his own recognizance, which is just a legal way of saying that he
*  releases him.
*  So Trump's free to go.
*  Trump does, in fact, go.
*  He stands up and he makes to move out of the courtroom.
*  And I can see that his face is kind of strong.
*  He's jutting out his jaw, but it really looks this time as if it's effortful, as if he's
*  trying to hold it together.
*  He shakes Eric Trump's hand.
*  Eric Trump, his son, is sitting right behind him.
*  And he walks out of the courtroom.
*  No handcuffs, no booking.
*  Is that typical?
*  Yeah, this is a nonviolent crime in New York and the sentencing hasn't happened yet.
*  Trump was, of course, never in prison before this.
*  So it's not unusual that he would not be sent to jail at this point.
*  So that's it.
*  He walks out and waits for the moment when he's sentenced.
*  That's right.
*  OK, so let's talk about how it is we got to this unanimous verdict and what I think we
*  should acknowledge is a total victory for the district attorney who brought this case.
*  When you were last at this table with me, closing arguments had just finished for the
*  prosecution and the defense.
*  So help us understand what happened that brings us to this outcome after that.
*  Sure.
*  Wednesday morning, bright and early, we were back at it in the courtroom where the judge
*  gave the jury their instructions.
*  And in these instructions, he, for the first time, really helped them to understand this
*  very complicated case because each of the 34 felony falsifying business record charges
*  against Donald Trump holds within it multiple other crimes.
*  So let me explain what I mean by that.
*  So prosecutors accused Trump of covering up reimbursements to Michael Cohen that came
*  after Cohen paid Stormy Daniels.
*  And prosecutors say that payment to Stormy Daniels was part of an election conspiracy
*  that Trump, Cohen, and the former publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, were
*  all involved in.
*  So the jury is, for the first time hearing, that not only do they have to find him guilty
*  or not guilty of falsifying business records, but it has to cover up that election conspiracy
*  and, even more complicatedly, that election conspiracy has to have made use of unlawful
*  means that I'm doing air quotes with my hands.
*  So there's another crime underneath the election conspiracy.
*  The jurors don't have to be unanimous about what that crime is, but they have to find
*  that in some way, somehow, Donald Trump criminally conspired to win the 2016 election and that
*  he falsified business records to do so.
*  I'm curious if this felt confusing to the jurors because it is very complicated.
*  Yeah, I mean, it was confusing.
*  And I can say that for a fact because the jurors actually asked to hear the jury instructions
*  read back again.
*  But we learned later they didn't want to hear the entire 55-page jury instruction.
*  They asked to start at a very specific place.
*  So in these jury instructions, the judge explained this concept called evidentiary inferences.
*  And it's a lot of syllables, but it means something very simple, which is what kinds
*  of logical leaps to conclusions can you make when you're evaluating a criminal case?
*  And so what the judge had already told them and now tells them again, he explains by analogy.
*  He says, suppose you go to bed one night and it's not raining and you wake up in the morning,
*  you look out your window and you see that the street is wet and the sidewalk is wet.
*  Under those circumstances, it might be reasonable to infer that it had rained overnight.
*  And so in this case, what he seems to be saying and what these instructions more importantly
*  seem to be guiding them is, yes, maybe Trump is not in every situation that prosecutors
*  have said, this looks as if a crime were committed.
*  This is a part of the conspiracy.
*  But given that the evidence gestures at him leading all these actions that prosecutors
*  have talked about, it might be reasonable to infer that in fact, Trump was responsible
*  for these various hush money deals that prosecutors have said were part of the conspiracy.
*  Interesting.
*  And for the falsification of business records to cover up one hush money deal in particular,
*  that payment to Stormy Daniels.
*  So in a sense, it kind of sounds like the jury is in asking for this particular set
*  of instructions, suggesting that in their minds, everything is wet.
*  And they are asking, can we infer that when it comes to Trump, in this case, it has rained?
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  And along with the jury instructions, the jurors have asked for excerpts of testimony,
*  three of them belonging to David Pecker.
*  Prosecutors say that he's one member of the tripod conspiracy that was formed at Trump
*  Tower between Pecker, Michael Cohen, and Donald Trump to suppress negative news about Trump
*  in the 2016 election.
*  So three pieces of testimony from Pecker, one piece of testimony from Michael Cohen,
*  and two of those pieces of testimony actually concern that Trump Tower meeting.
*  They want to hear what Michael Cohen had to say about it.
*  They want to hear what David Pecker had to say about it.
*  And what do you take from the request for these pieces of testimony again?
*  So it's a fool's errand to read too much into requests like this.
*  They could have been looking for 100 different things.
*  But it was interesting to me that they wanted testimony from both Pecker and Cohen about
*  the same meeting, because what it suggests to me is, oh, maybe they want to compare these
*  two accounts of this very, very important meeting in the prosecution's case.
*  And so we looked up the transcripts.
*  And what we saw is Pecker and Cohen tell pretty much the same story.
*  Like for instance, David Pecker testified that at that meeting he offered to be Trump's
*  eyes and ears.
*  Michael Cohen testified that at that meeting, David Pecker offered to keep an eye out for
*  negative news stories about Trump during the campaign.
*  So yeah, those don't exactly match.
*  But that's a win.
*  If you have two people telling a story from 2015 in 2024, and they're using expressions
*  that directly echo each other, that's pretty good for the prosecution's case.
*  Right.
*  Because the jurors seem to be focusing on what feels like an important moment in the
*  development of this conspiracy.
*  And of course, conspiracy is at the center of these charges.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay.
*  We of course now know that these inquiries from the jurors were an insight into their
*  mindset, which was that Trump was guilty.
*  And that makes me want to reflect for just a moment on the defense in this case, because
*  Jonah throughout our conversations, all these episodes we've done with you, you've always
*  found a way to signal, I think, that the defense was meaningfully weaker in its presentation
*  to the jury than the prosecution was.
*  And now that the case is over, and now that we know that the defense has lost, I wonder
*  what your diagnosis is of why they lost.
*  Well, let's be clear, the defense was up against an enormous amount in this case.
*  The prosecution had a ton of documentary evidence.
*  They had a New York jury, which means people who may not have been all that sympathetic
*  to Donald Trump.
*  They had a strong trial team and strong trial lawyers.
*  And they had a pretty elegantly designed trial case with a lot of sizzle and flash and exciting
*  stuff to get the jury engaged and keep them engaged.
*  But the prosecution also had one big advantage that we haven't talked about yet, and defense
*  had one big disadvantage, and it's the same thing.
*  It's Donald Trump.
*  Donald Trump was under a gag order for this entire trial, and that gag order barred him
*  from attacking witnesses, among other people.
*  Two witnesses who we'd be most prone to attacking were Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen.
*  And so it's very interesting that while Trump was gagged like this, was not able to attack
*  those people, his lawyers, the people who actually are not hired to attack for him,
*  they're not attack dogs, actually, their lawyers did two things that really stick out in my
*  mind.
*  One is that they denied that he had sex with Stormy Daniels.
*  They did that in their opening.
*  That's not a part of the case, but it's something that Trump has done for years and years.
*  And so that clearly was very important to them, probably because it was very important
*  to him.
*  And then even more, obviously, they attacked Michael Cohen at every chance they got.
*  They attacked him in their opening.
*  They attacked him in their closing.
*  They attacked him while he was testifying.
*  They attacked him while other people were testifying.
*  Attack Michael Cohen was their first, second, and third instinct in this case, maybe because
*  it is Donald Trump's first, second, and third instinct to attack his adversaries.
*  But in criminal court, where there are parameters, you have to be thoughtful and elegant and
*  concede things that you don't necessarily want to concede.
*  There was a point during this case where the judge even told the defense the jury was
*  out of the room.
*  You could have attacked the idea of the false business records.
*  You could have attacked this.
*  You could have attacked that.
*  But instead, you spent your opening statement opening the door to testimony from Stormy
*  Daniels by denying a sexual encounter ever happened.
*  By denying that sexual encounter ever happened.
*  So when we think about the defense in this case, I think we have to think about the defendant.
*  You're saying basically the defense is hamstrung by the requirements of what Donald Trump wanted
*  from his defense lawyer, which seemed to be a set of attacks that have worked well for
*  him in politics, but just didn't seem to work that well against all this evidence in this
*  courtroom.
*  That's exactly right.
*  An example that people kept bringing up during the trial, sources, lawyers, people who have
*  seen a lot of trials, they would say, what they should say is, look, my client is a scumbag.
*  We know you hate him, but he did not do this.
*  That's the kind of thing, that's the kind of candidness or what would be perceived at
*  least by jurors as candidness that can get the jury on your side.
*  They could have been a more effective defense if Trump would let them.
*  Yes.
*  This did not go well for the defense.
*  Their client, former president, Donald Trump, has been convicted of 34 felonies.
*  Right.
*  And the question now that he has been convicted on all these counts is, what happens to him?
*  What happens next?
*  Right.
*  It's a good question and the answer is complicated and not entirely clear.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so Jonah, what does happen next in this case of the people of the state of New York
*  versus Donald Trump?
*  Just give us a roadmap for the next few days and weeks.
*  In the next few days, it's entirely possible we could see an appeal.
*  Trump is not known for holding his fire when it comes to legal maneuvers of that sort.
*  But appeals on what ground?
*  Well, that's what remains to be seen.
*  It'll be very interesting to figure out what exactly Trump's lawyers decide to bring up
*  here.
*  There is one very obvious thing, which is that Trump was charged with falsifying business
*  records to cover up an election conspiracy.
*  That election conspiracy is related to this little known state law, 17152, it's called,
*  and it just doesn't have that much history.
*  Certainly it has no history being used in this manner.
*  And so one thing that I would imagine Trump's lawyers will bring up is the enormity of this
*  case based on this not very well known law.
*  Okay, so that's the question of appeals turned now to sentencing.
*  So this we know a little bit more straightforwardly.
*  We don't know what's going to happen, of course, but we know when it's going to happen.
*  The judge has already scheduled the sentencing.
*  It's going to be in July.
*  It's actually going to be four days before the Republican convention where Trump is officially
*  nominated.
*  That's incredible timing.
*  So we keep having this split screen this year of Trump's legal issues and his campaign.
*  And here's another example of it.
*  Is it normal for sentencing to be delayed this long?
*  July is a month and change away.
*  It's extremely normal because in New York, what happens before sentencing is you get
*  something called a probation report.
*  You meet with the probation office of New York.
*  Trump is going to go into the probation office in New York.
*  It will probably come to him, I would imagine, given the Secret Service concerns, but Trump
*  will meet with a probation officer who will interview him and will provide a report recommending
*  a certain sentence.
*  And that's one of many things the judge can take into account when he decides to sentence
*  Donald Trump.
*  Okay, so that was my next question.
*  Who's responsible for sentencing?
*  You just said it's the judge.
*  What kind of sentence guidelines are in place?
*  What kind of sentence might there be?
*  So Trump has been convicted of 34 e-nonviolent felonies.
*  The penalty for the felonies he's been convicted of is up to four years in prison, but there's
*  no prison time required.
*  So he can also just be put on probation.
*  And there's a lot of considerations that go into this.
*  So for example, Trump is a first time offender.
*  Often a first time offender on a nonviolent felony might get a relatively lenient sentence,
*  maybe just probation, maybe a small amount of time in jail.
*  But there are also considerations on the other hand to take into account.
*  Such as?
*  Trump violated a gag order 10 times during this trial and was fined $10,000 for doing
*  so.
*  And so the fact that he flouted the judge's orders 10 separate times, that could also
*  be taken into account.
*  There's also the question of how Trump behaves after the verdict.
*  Judges often evaluate a defendant's remorse or lack thereof.
*  In fact, the judge in Trump's civil fraud case, when he came down very, very hard on
*  him, charging him hundreds of millions of dollars, explicitly commented on Trump's
*  lack of remorse, said it was near pathological.
*  And it would not be unusual or an abuse of power.
*  It would be totally typical to look at what a defendant is doing, a convicted defendant
*  is doing, and take it into account when you think about a sentence.
*  In other words, Trump's not only lack of remorse so far, but his open disdain for the judge
*  in this entire process could end up being very consequential when it comes to sentencing.
*  It's a genuine danger for him.
*  Okay, well let's just play this out.
*  Let's say on July 11th that the judge does sentence Trump to prison.
*  What happens?
*  What does it look like?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, normally when a defendant is sentenced, I'll give you an example.
*  Alan Weisselberg, that's Trump's former chief financial officer.
*  I've seen him sentenced twice in the past few years.
*  And after he was sentenced, he was handcuffed, he was taken into custody, and eventually
*  went to Rikers to serve out months long sentences each time.
*  But with Trump, even though that's normally what would happen, I just can't sit here and
*  tell you, Michael, that I know that exact same thing is going to happen.
*  Trump has been so successful at fighting American norms since the minute he came onto
*  the political scene in 2015.
*  But I don't know what happens if the judge sentences him to prison, whether he goes,
*  whether the sentence is somehow deferred or delayed, either until after the election or
*  later.
*  Perhaps even after his presidency.
*  Perhaps even after his presidency.
*  If he's elected.
*  If Trump appeals, the judge could decide to keep him out during the appeal just to be
*  maximally fair.
*  That would make sense.
*  And it seems as if it's something we could see happen.
*  I really just feel somewhat at a loss.
*  It's funny because usually a verdict kind of helps you feel more confident.
*  Now we don't have to say allegations.
*  We can say Trump falsified business records to orchestrate a conspiracy to aid his 2016
*  election victory.
*  Right.
*  But we cannot say exactly what the consequence is going to be.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, let's play out the alternative, which is that the judge at sentencing says no prison
*  time, just probation.
*  What kind of restrictions would a conviction, but no prison time, have on Trump in terms
*  of his movements or ability to conduct a campaign as best you understand it?
*  I mean, this is just a remarkable possibility.
*  Often people on probation have to meet with their probation officer, tell them what they've
*  been up to.
*  So for instance, something that our colleague Willie Rashbaum keeps saying is Trump will
*  have to answer the question, what are you doing for work?
*  I mean, if he's elected.
*  I'm president.
*  Exactly.
*  People on probation are not supposed to associate with known felons.
*  That's something of an issue for Trump.
*  Right.
*  Because known felons are in his political orbit.
*  That's right.
*  And a third thing you're supposed to tell a probation officer is your travel plans when
*  you leave a state.
*  Usually someone who is on probation has their movements restricted.
*  Right.
*  And you know who travels a lot and leaves the state a lot?
*  A candidate for president.
*  That's right.
*  So this is going to be very strange, even if he's just on probation.
*  Yes.
*  Let's assume for a minute that Donald Trump gets reelected because as best I can tell
*  and correct me if I'm wrong, Jonah, nothing about this conviction disqualifies him from
*  holding the office of president.
*  That's right.
*  We know once he becomes president, he can't pardon himself for this crime because it's
*  a local crime, not a federal crime.
*  As president, he can pardon himself in theory for federal crimes.
*  This isn't one of them.
*  But once he becomes president, what can he do with the power of that office to somehow
*  mitigate the fact of this conviction?
*  Is there anything you can do?
*  I mean, as far as we can see right now, not that much.
*  A conviction stays with you.
*  There could be some mechanism through which Trump is able to alter this.
*  But for now, it's going to be what any conviction is.
*  It's going to stay with him and follow him for the rest of his life, very possibly.
*  This is a real serious stain on his legacy.
*  Jonah, we know that throughout this trial, Trump has spoken of it as a witch hunt, said
*  he didn't think he could get a fair trial in New York, that the government was out to
*  get him.
*  And this is the latest chapter of Democrats seeking his destruction.
*  How has he responded to the conviction in the hours since the verdict came down?
*  In much the same way, but with one big difference.
*  This was a disgrace.
*  This was a rigged trial by a conflicted judge who was corrupt.
*  He attacked the judge.
*  He attacked the case.
*  Our whole country is being rigged right now.
*  This was done by the Biden administration.
*  He attacked President Biden, saying that the case had been brought by him, which it was
*  not.
*  Right.
*  But then he said.
*  The real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people.
*  The real verdict is going to be on November 5th.
*  Election day.
*  This is long from over.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Trump has been trapped in court, but now he's out until the sentencing.
*  At least he's out and he's back in the political realm and he's going to take what happened
*  legally and reframe it politically.
*  And that's what he's doing by pointing at the election.
*  He is going to take this case in which he was convicted by a jury of his peers and he
*  is going to say, look at this nonsense that was brought against me by President Biden.
*  This is why we have to beat the Democrats in November.
*  Right.
*  I know you're not a political reporter.
*  You're a court reporter.
*  But I think we do have to reflect on the kind of strangeness of this moment as it lands
*  in the political sphere.
*  I mean, for a good number of Democrats, this is the outcome that on some level they may
*  have always expected and perhaps wanted given Trump's conduct.
*  They wanted him convicted of a crime.
*  For a good number of Republicans who have been told by Trump that he's the subject of
*  a witch hunt and they're coming after him, this is also the outcome that they expected,
*  but they didn't want it.
*  They dreaded it because they believe Trump is a victim of a witch hunt.
*  And I guess the question is, what does this mean not to those two groups, but to this
*  crucial group of voters in the middle who didn't want it, didn't fear it, but now just
*  have to live in a world where one of the two candidates for president has been convicted
*  of a crime?
*  This is the all-important political question.
*  And I feel comfortable answering it because in some ways it is a question about the law.
*  What do you mean?
*  Trump has taken on the law and the law has taken on Trump.
*  He's been indicted four times.
*  He's been convicted in this first trial.
*  And he has at every turn said that the law is illegitimate.
*  And so one way to ask the question you just asked me is, leaving aside people who hate
*  Trump and people who love Trump, what will people choose?
*  The law or Donald Trump?
*  That's what this election is going to be about.
*  The American legal system and what it says is okay and what it says is not, this man
*  who has run roughshod over it has taken what it has to offer, which is a jury trial, has
*  been convicted and may still triumph.
*  So I think that this election pits the law against Donald Trump in the minds of the American
*  voter and it's just going to be fascinating to see what they do.
*  Well, Jonah, thank you very much.
*  Of course, thanks for having me throughout the trial.
*  Thank you for being here throughout the trial.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, President Biden authorized Ukraine to conduct limited strikes inside of Russia
*  with U.S. made weapons, opening a new and riskier chapter in the two year old war.
*  The decision marks the first time that a U.S. president has authorized attacks on military
*  targets inside a nuclear armed adversary.
*  Biden has long resisted such a move, fearing that it could trigger a U.S. war with Russia.
*  As a result, his authorization is extremely narrow.
*  Under it, Ukraine may use American weapons to hit targets just inside Russian territory
*  that have been attacking Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv.
*  Ukraine may not use U.S. weapons to attack Russia more broadly.
*  A reminder, we'll be sharing a new episode of our colleague's show, The Interview, tomorrow.
*  This week, David Marchese talks with the director Richard Linklater about his new movie, Hitman,
*  and about how his relationship to moviemaking has changed over the past four decades.
*  I don't think you can ever replace that initial just passion and fury when you've discovered
*  your art form and you just take it in with your entire being.
