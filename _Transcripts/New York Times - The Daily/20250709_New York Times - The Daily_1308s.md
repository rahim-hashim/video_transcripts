# Trump’s Top Aides Spread the Epstein Conspiracy. Now They Are Trying to Kill It.
**New York Times - The Daily:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=4.76s)]
*  Today, the story of how the conspiracy theories surrounding Jeffrey Epstein made their way [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=9.76s)]
*  to the highest levels of the Trump administration, and why over the past few days, the White [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=20.88s)]
*  House finally decided it was time to shut them down. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=26.56s)]
*  My colleague, Glenn Thrush, takes us inside the saga. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=33.08s)]
*  It's Wednesday, July 9th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=45.08s)]
*  Hey there, Glenn. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  17 minutes late? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=61.0s)]
*  Well, you know, you're lucky it wasn't 20. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  I know you're on deadline, so thank you for making time for us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=67.56s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=70.48s)]
*  Glenn, we don't think of President Trump and those around him as people who declaratively [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=71.48s)]
*  and definitively kill off conspiracy theories, especially when those conspiracy theories [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=78.68s)]
*  are popular with their supporters, quite the contrary. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=84.76s)]
*  And yet, that's what has just happened. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=88.12s)]
*  So tell us that story. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=91.24s)]
*  Well, look, on Monday, they tried to slam the door on an investigation they themselves [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=92.24s)]
*  had opened. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=98.0s)]
*  The Justice Department, in a pretty detailed memo, confirmed what a bunch of other investigations [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=99.24s)]
*  had already shown. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=104.44s)]
*  There was no client list of shadowy Jeffrey Epstein clients that conspired to murder him, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=106.26s)]
*  and they released a bunch of videotapes that showed what had already been revealed in other [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=113.76s)]
*  investigations, that he died by suicide. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=117.72s)]
*  The problem with all this is that most of the people involved in running these investigations, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=122.44s)]
*  the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, Cash Patel at the FBI, Dan Bongino, his deputy, had over [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  the years suggested that there was something nefarious that was being covered up by the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=134.68s)]
*  Biden administration, and that they were the ones who were going to get to the bottom [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=139.2s)]
*  of this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=143.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=144.06s)]
*  Thus, that phrase you just invoked that this was the White House trying to slam a door [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=145.06s)]
*  that they themselves had kicked open, which is a very tricky piece of business. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=149.42s)]
*  So tell us that in fuller detail, really the birth, the life, and what is now the attempted [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  death of this uniquely Trumpian conspiracy theory surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, and how [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=160.88s)]
*  it ultimately enmeshes so many senior members of the Trump administration? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=168.32s)]
*  I mean, it's a really unlikely cause celeb for Donald Trump, who himself spent a fair [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=174.24s)]
*  amount of time hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=181.52s)]
*  So this is all born out of a death. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=185.16s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein is found in his cell hanging in July 2019. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=187.72s)]
*  The medical examiner determines that it was a suicide. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=193.0s)]
*  The Bureau of Prison determines the same. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=196.32s)]
*  The Department of Justice concurs. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=198.92s)]
*  The investigations, which took place under the Biden administration, found no evidence [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=201.68s)]
*  of anything nefarious in his death, but really almost from the start, it snowballs into something [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=206.94s)]
*  much bigger. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=212.64s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein is one of the most connected guys in the world. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=214.12s)]
*  His death occurs under really weird circumstances in a totally dysfunctional prison. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  There are gaps in the narrative. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=223.94s)]
*  It is very hard for people to accept that it was what it appeared to be, which is a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=226.2s)]
*  distraught man who had been convicted and accused of monstrous crimes that had just [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=233.72s)]
*  taken his life. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=240.32s)]
*  Sex trafficking. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=241.32s)]
*  Sex trafficking with minors, possession of pornography, just the worst possible crimes [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=242.32s)]
*  in our society. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  What happens then over the next few years is these doubts begin to grow and grow and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=250.12s)]
*  grow alongside the right wing populist movement. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=255.4s)]
*  I look at it as sort of the Swiss Army knife of conspiracies. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=259.36s)]
*  On one hand, it shows this cabal of incredibly powerful men who are hanging around a guy [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=264.32s)]
*  who was sex trafficking minors. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=269.76s)]
*  Bill Clinton was on his plane. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=272.36s)]
*  Members of the British royal family were on his plane. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=275.44s)]
*  Bill Gates hung out with Epstein. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=277.76s)]
*  It really feeds the fever swamps of conspiracy theorists who form a good part of Trump's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=280.48s)]
*  far-right coalition that there is this international cabal of people who are making decisions and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=287.0s)]
*  covering up monstrous crimes. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=292.92s)]
*  I want to see Epstein's list. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=296.12s)]
*  I want to see the list of the sexual misconduct slush fund. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=297.6s)]
*  Release the files! [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=302.68s)]
*  Release the files! [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=303.68s)]
*  For once, it would be nice to see the federal government forced to tell the truth about [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=306.44s)]
*  something. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=310.64s)]
*  And this became a central core of the argument made by many Trump supporters that the Justice [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=311.8s)]
*  Department and FBI were corrupt, engaged in covering up information to protect their allies, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=318.08s)]
*  and needed to be overhauled. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=324.92s)]
*  So on one hand, it fed into sort of the emotional force of the Trump coalition, that they were [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=326.52s)]
*  overturning a corrupt establishment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=332.4s)]
*  On the flip side, it enabled people who have claimed that they needed to take radical steps [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=335.0s)]
*  to overhaul and root out deep state influences in federal law enforcement, gave them a justification [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=340.44s)]
*  for doing so. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=347.44s)]
*  So it has been an extraordinarily central element of the Trump coalition. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=348.6s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=354.24s)]
*  So this becomes a totem of you cannot trust your justice system. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=356.16s)]
*  People inside that system, presumably Democrats, liberal leaning people, they are using the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=362.32s)]
*  justice system to protect their own. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=368.04s)]
*  That's the distilled version of this theory. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=370.32s)]
*  Remember, this is coming at roughly the same time he's being targeted by the Justice Department. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=373.6s)]
*  And so this dovetails with this larger sense that Trump and his supporters have that the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=379.88s)]
*  government, which is being controlled by Democrats, is coming after them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=384.32s)]
*  So by the time the 2024 campaign rolls around, the Epstein case is baked into the Trump base. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=389.76000000000005s)]
*  Everybody associated with Trump, working around him, who wants to come back to power with [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=397.16s)]
*  him, really needs to embrace this cause. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  And the focal point becomes this mythical client list, this roster of the rich and powerful [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=406.44000000000005s)]
*  who were somehow in on the Epstein conspiracy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=413.92s)]
*  Let's just say by client list, clients of what exactly? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=416.56s)]
*  In general, it's the group of rich and powerful older men who are on the sex trafficking list. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=421.56s)]
*  But it's also been expressed as people who have flown on the plane with Epstein. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  Really the belief that there is a spreadsheet or a list in a book that enumerates this club [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=434.28s)]
*  of people who are both morally bankrupt and enormously powerful and are overseeing a coverup. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=440.92s)]
*  That's the claim. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=447.8s)]
*  The theory is that such a list exists and it's really the holy grail of the Epstein conspiracy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=449.04s)]
*  So two people who become really vocal about that theory are Cash Patel, a first term Trump [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=455.40000000000003s)]
*  official who goes on to become one of his loudest campaign surrogates, and Dan Bongino, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=461.16s)]
*  a former secret service agent from Long Island who hosts a popular podcast. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=467.56s)]
*  Dan Bongino. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  Welcome to the Bongino Brief. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=475.44s)]
*  I'm Dan Bongino. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=476.68s)]
*  What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  What do Clinton, Obama officials, big money leftists, a former prime minister of Israel, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  why do they want to make this Jeffrey Epstein story go away so bad? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=489.12s)]
*  So Bongino speaking on his own podcast suggested that there were a lot of these people on the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=492.78s)]
*  list who had stories to tell about how this conspiracy was formed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=498.02s)]
*  And there may be some stories to tell about the activities of those rich, famous and powerful [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=502.7s)]
*  people and some underaged women that they should not have been around at all and definitely [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=507.78s)]
*  not around in the manner that some of my sources tell me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=514.26s)]
*  You getting what I'm saying? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=517.9399999999999s)]
*  And Cash Patel pushes it even further by singling out Bill Gates. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=520.2s)]
*  You don't think that Bill Gates is lobbying Congress night and day to prevent the disclosure [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  of that list? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=529.12s)]
*  What the hell are the House Republicans doing? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=530.2800000000001s)]
*  They have the majority. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  You can't get the list? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=533.8000000000001s)]
*  Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=535.4000000000001s)]
*  And of course, when Donald Trump becomes President Trump once again, wins the 2024 election, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=539.48s)]
*  he puts both Bongino and Patel in positions of pretty extraordinary authority inside the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=546.36s)]
*  Federal Bureau of Investigation. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=556.26s)]
*  Exactly Michael. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=559.36s)]
*  And he makes Patel director and he inserts Bongino as Patel's number two. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=560.36s)]
*  And what's extraordinary about this is they have less experience in those jobs than anyone [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=565.98s)]
*  else who has ever occupied them. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=570.5s)]
*  And the justification for putting them in despite their lack of experience is that there [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=572.84s)]
*  are all these conspiracies and cover-ups going on and only an outsider untainted by the bureaucracy [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=577.82s)]
*  has the guts and power to rip everything apart. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  That's kind of fascinating. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=588.76s)]
*  In other words, only the kind of people who would embrace and promulgate conspiracy theories [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=589.76s)]
*  are qualified to get inside the government and get to the bottom of them. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=596.2s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=601.0s)]
*  Well, so what happens once these people, the Bonginos, the Patels, having embraced this [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=602.08s)]
*  conspiracy theory, end up in these positions of power in which they can actually investigate [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=607.2s)]
*  them? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=614.88s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=615.88s)]
*  Patel and Bongino jumped into the FBI at a time of crisis when there were mass firings [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=616.88s)]
*  and huge instability. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=623.52s)]
*  So they really had to focus on stabilizing. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=624.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=628.12s)]
*  Trump was busy firing all his perceived enemies inside that bureau. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=629.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  So Pam Bondi, the attorney general, who remember was an emergency second pick when Matt Gaetz [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=634.2800000000001s)]
*  went down in flames, eager to please President Trump, raises her hand and says, I'm going [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  to take care of this. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=646.44s)]
*  So she goes on Fox. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=648.12s)]
*  The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=654.12s)]
*  And when she's asked about the Epstein client list, she says... [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=655.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=662.28s)]
*  She says, I have all these files on my desk. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=665.12s)]
*  A lot of flight logs, a lot of names, a lot of information. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=667.76s)]
*  And the very next day... [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=671.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm here at the White House. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  I just met with Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=676.68s)]
*  Bondi shows up at this meeting of MAGA influencers. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=679.6s)]
*  A lot of them were Epstein conspiracy theorists and hands out these big, thick white binders. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=683.36s)]
*  It says on the front, the Epstein files, phase one by order of Attorney General Pam [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  Bondi and FBI Director Cash Patel. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  See that right there? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=695.64s)]
*  That's the Epstein files. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=697.4s)]
*  And for a moment, all of these people sitting around this room think, we finally got it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=699.16s)]
*  There's so much to tell you. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=704.6800000000001s)]
*  All I can say is, promises made, promises kept. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  We're finally going to get the truth about Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  So then they flipped open the binders and man were they disappointed. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=717.76s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  So Glenn, what ends up being inside of those thick white binders that Attorney General [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=728.96s)]
*  Bondi has handed out to these MAGA influencers? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=742.36s)]
*  Not much. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=745.72s)]
*  It's mostly procedural jargon, heavily, heavily redacted. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=746.72s)]
*  It was a big dud. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=753.88s)]
*  No client list, not even manifest necessarily from the Plains. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=755.32s)]
*  It was a lot of stuff that had already been in the public domain. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=759.96s)]
*  So there was this huge backlash against Bondi in particular for having over promised. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=762.96s)]
*  We're all waiting for bombshells. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=769.2s)]
*  We're all waiting for juicy stuff. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=770.2s)]
*  And that's not what's in this binder. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  That's not what's in this binder at all. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=773.88s)]
*  It is the biggest disappointment I think that you'll find. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=775.44s)]
*  So she first responds by blaming the FBI. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=778.4200000000001s)]
*  Mr. Patel is going to get us a detailed report as to why the FBI withheld all of those documents. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=781.68s)]
*  And blaming prosecutors in other offices for slow walking, which turned out not necessarily [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=789.4799999999999s)]
*  to be true. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=795.56s)]
*  And a source had told me where the documents were being kept. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=796.56s)]
*  Southern District of New York shop. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=800.8399999999999s)]
*  Then what happens is Bondi dispatches a bunch of prosecutors from the National Security [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=803.04s)]
*  Division of the Justice Department who are otherwise involved in high level international [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=808.68s)]
*  investigations out to this facility in Virginia to go through videotape and files to see if [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=814.1999999999999s)]
*  there's anything in them. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  The FBI, they're reviewing, there are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=822.1999999999999s)]
*  or child porn. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=830.3599999999999s)]
*  People who are supposed to be looking at terrorism investigations, foreign influence, are looking [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=832.2399999999999s)]
*  into a case of a guy who had died more than half a decade prior. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=837.6s)]
*  And you suspect Glenn that she's doing this because she actually thinks they're going [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=847.2s)]
*  to find something or because she thinks I need to say that I did this. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=850.72s)]
*  In baseball, it's called running out the ground ball. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=855.48s)]
*  She needs to show that she's making a maximum effort. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=858.46s)]
*  And so does Patel, who's also dispatching dozens and dozens of FBI agents. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  Some of them pulled off of other cases to do the same thing. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=867.5s)]
*  So a sizable portion of the United States federal law enforcement apparatus is devoting [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  itself to what the federal government itself has already said is a nothing burger. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=878.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=883.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the outside, the pressure just keeps building and building and building. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=884.26s)]
*  And because folks in Trump's MAGA base can't blame him for doing a bait and switch, they [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=889.02s)]
*  focus on federal law enforcement, particularly Pam Bondi. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=895.2199999999999s)]
*  Laura Loomer, who's never liked Bondi, thought that she was too liberal to be in her job, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=898.8599999999999s)]
*  starts calling for her resignation. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=905.3399999999999s)]
*  So Patel and Bongino, who are both wise in the ways of Trump politics, are seeing this [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=908.42s)]
*  happening in real time, and they want to minimize the damage. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  So they go on Fox. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=918.52s)]
*  You said Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  And they give a very uncomfortable interview. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=925.66s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, they have a right to their opinion. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=928.3s)]
*  But as someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor, who's been in that [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=932.5s)]
*  prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=936.42s)]
*  housing, you know a suicide when you see one. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=940.2199999999999s)]
*  And that's what that was. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=943.3399999999999s)]
*  Bongino says, with a very stern countenance. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=944.8199999999999s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=947.74s)]
*  Again, you want me to? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=949.54s)]
*  I've seen the whole file. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=951.62s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=953.02s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=954.14s)]
*  Nothing to see here. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=955.86s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=957.06s)]
*  And they're now doing a 180 from where they were before, because there was once a moment [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=958.06s)]
*  where fanning this conspiracy theory was to their benefit, to Trump's benefit. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=962.8199999999999s)]
*  Suddenly now, it's not. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=969.06s)]
*  It had become a liability, because they couldn't meet the expectations they themselves had stoked. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=971.62s)]
*  And so, Glenn, I think that brings us to this week, when the administration sends out this [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=977.34s)]
*  memo where we started our conversation, saying, officially, there's nothing to see here. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=986.82s)]
*  There is no conspiracy. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=992.6600000000001s)]
*  There's no evidence of a conspiracy. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=994.02s)]
*  Move on. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=995.7800000000001s)]
*  From everything you're saying, the White House does this because this conspiracy theory is [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=997.02s)]
*  to threaten to eat its own leaders, Bondi, Bongino, Patel. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1003.98s)]
*  And so the answer to a question that has in many ways loomed over the Trump world for [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1008.58s)]
*  a really long time, which is when will the president and those around him kill off a [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1013.26s)]
*  conspiracy? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1019.26s)]
*  The answer to that is when it undermines their own authority and their ability to do their [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1020.26s)]
*  jobs. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1027.62s)]
*  Donald Trump views his political positions as changeable, and he uses this kind of conspiracy [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1028.6599999999999s)]
*  theory to provide energy, almost rocket fuel for his own movement. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1036.3s)]
*  And when it no longer suits his purposes, he's willing to move on. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1042.02s)]
*  There was a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, and he was asked about the closing of the Epstein [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1046.02s)]
*  investigation. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1050.9799999999998s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1051.9799999999998s)]
*  This guy's been talked about for years. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1054.9399999999998s)]
*  You're asking, we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1057.34s)]
*  And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1062.6599999999999s)]
*  That is unbelievable. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1066.58s)]
*  And he basically said, why is anyone still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1069.1799999999998s)]
*  And Bondi essentially said the same thing. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1074.5s)]
*  So the word from the top now is that the Epstein case is closed and people need to move on. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1077.74s)]
*  I'm curious what you think the lesson here will be for these three top Trump officials [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1085.58s)]
*  who really did get burned by this experience, Bondi, Bongino, Patel. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1091.1s)]
*  It's one thing to be on the outside when you can say whatever you want, there's no responsibility [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1096.8999999999999s)]
*  for proving anything. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1101.1399999999999s)]
*  It's another when you have to actually run the organizations you've spent years and years [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1102.82s)]
*  beating up and accusing of coverups. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1107.3799999999999s)]
*  It only takes an instant for the outsiders to then turn on you. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1110.58s)]
*  And I think that's what Pam Bondi is learning. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1114.62s)]
*  That's what Cash Patel is learning. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1117.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's what Dan Bongino is learning. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1119.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1121.26s)]
*  When you write a conspiracy theory about basically the deep state to power, you very much run [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1122.26s)]
*  the risk, and this seems to be what happened here, of becoming in the eyes of those who [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1129.06s)]
*  believe in the conspiracy theory, the deep state itself. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1133.8999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1137.62s)]
*  In a sense, this is what happens when outsiders become insiders. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1138.62s)]
*  They have the responsibility for running the institution, even an institution that [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1142.72s)]
*  they've attacked and have claimed is corrupt. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1147.18s)]
*  The day to day responsibilities that these people are bearing forces them to accept realities [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1149.94s)]
*  that folks outside the wall don't have to. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1156.2s)]
*  So the whole thing is kind of an interesting paradox. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1163.92s)]
*  On one hand, they may have done the right thing institutionally. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1166.2s)]
*  They may have ultimately stood on the path of truth here, but they've weakened their [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1169.8s)]
*  own position in the movement that elevated them. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1174.84s)]
*  By contradicting these conspiracy theories, they've incurred the wrath of the people who [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1177.8799999999999s)]
*  put them in power. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  Trump's base. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1183.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, Glenn, thank you very much. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1189.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1190.68s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1191.68s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1200.8s)]
*  The Supreme Court said that President Trump can move ahead with plans to slash the federal [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1204.28s)]
*  workforce and dismantle federal agencies without input from Congress. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1209.48s)]
*  The ruling could result in job losses for tens of thousands of workers. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1215.12s)]
*  The ruling is Trump's latest victory before the Supreme Court as he tries to expand his [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1220.12s)]
*  power and reshape the federal government. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1225.36s)]
*  And on Tuesday, President Trump issued some of his harshest criticism to date of Russian [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1229.36s)]
*  leader Vladimir Putin, implying that Putin could not be trusted in negotiations to end [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1235.56s)]
*  the war in Ukraine. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1241.72s)]
*  We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin for you want to know the truth. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1243.24s)]
*  He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1247.12s)]
*  The remarks came a day after Trump reversed course and said that he would supply Ukraine [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1252.04s)]
*  with more U.S. weapons to fend off Russia, something that Putin has sought to prevent. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1258.04s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Ricky Nowitzki, Rochelle Banja and Carlos Prieto. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1266.92s)]
*  It was edited by Rachel Quester and Patricia Willens, contains original music by Alisha [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1272.72s)]
*  Butyitube and Rui Nymisto and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1278.12s)]
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansbrook of Wunderly. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1282.96s)]
*  That's it for the Daily. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1288.04s)]
*  I'm Michael Bavaro. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ygrKM1Zgg&t=1299.8799999999999s)]
