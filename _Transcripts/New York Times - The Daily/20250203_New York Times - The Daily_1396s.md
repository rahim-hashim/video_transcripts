# China Challenges Silicon Valley for A.I. Dominance
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=4.4s)]
*  Last week, financial markets went into a panic over an obscure Chinese tech startup called [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=12.32s)]
*  DeepSeek. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  That company now threatens to upend the world of artificial intelligence and the race for [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=19.94s)]
*  who will dominate it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=24.86s)]
*  Today, my colleague Kevin Roos, a tech columnist and the co-host of the podcast Hard Fork, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  on how DeepSeek caught us all off guard. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=33.08s)]
*  It's Monday, February 3rd. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  Hi, Kevin. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=51.4s)]
*  Hello. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=54.44s)]
*  So great to be here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=55.6s)]
*  So let's jump in. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=60.0s)]
*  Kevin, how did this giant AI tech freakout begin? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=61.0s)]
*  Tell us that story. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=66.56s)]
*  So the freakout really started in earnest with a Chinese AI company called DeepSeek. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=67.92s)]
*  And DeepSeek had released a new AI model. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=74.28s)]
*  Models are released all the time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=78.72s)]
*  Generally, they don't make international news. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  But this model was different in a few ways. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=83.44s)]
*  DeepSeek released its new chatbot app, which is said to perform as well as chat GPT. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=89.08s)]
*  One of them was that it just appeared to be a really good model, like better than the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=94.8s)]
*  leading Chinese models at the time and on par or close to on par with the leading American [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=99.44s)]
*  models. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=105.12s)]
*  A new AI king was crowned today, well, at least for now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  And so the DeepSeek app. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=110.2s)]
*  Unseating open AI's chat GPT. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=112.44s)]
*  Goes to number one on the app store charts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  It vaults ahead of chat GPT and all these better known apps. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=117.4s)]
*  Now the most stunning thing here isn't necessarily that China has developed a pretty good AI app. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=122.2s)]
*  It's how cheap it is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  The more notable thing, the thing that really caused the American AI industry to start to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=131.88s)]
*  panic was how cheaply this model appeared to have been built. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=136.44s)]
*  How cheap are we talking? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  So we think that this model cost DeepSeek about $5.5 million to train. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=142.64s)]
*  Now that might sound like a lot of money, but it's really not compared to what many [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=149.12s)]
*  of the American AI companies are spending. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  Meta said that it was spending $65 billion. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=157.28s)]
*  Microsoft says it plans to spend about $80 billion. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=160.88s)]
*  Microsoft said it was spending $80 billion. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=164.48s)]
*  And some of the world's most prominent technology leaders pledging to invest an initial $100 [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=167.44s)]
*  billion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=172.4s)]
*  And OpenAI had just announced this giant partnership where they were planning to spend. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=173.4s)]
*  It could be up to half a trillion over the next four years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=177.84s)]
*  As much as half a trillion dollars to build the infrastructure for AI. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=180.4s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=184.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's wild. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=185.88s)]
*  And on top of that, DeepSeek says that they built their model without access to the latest [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=187.88s)]
*  and greatest American AI chips, which up until now were thought to be necessary to build [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=193.4s)]
*  the most powerful models. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=198.84s)]
*  A lot of people put a lot of money into AI and now they're wondering if that money is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=200.4s)]
*  needed the way that some of these American companies have said it is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=205.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=209.28s)]
*  And so investors start saying, wait a minute. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=210.28s)]
*  If it only costs $5.5 million to train a leading edge AI model, then what the heck are all [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=213.2s)]
*  these American companies doing spending hundreds of millions of dollars or even billions of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=223.76s)]
*  dollars to train roughly equivalent models? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=228.0s)]
*  Tech stocks plummeted Monday as investors raised concerns about advancements in Chinese [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=230.88s)]
*  artificial intelligence. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=235.64s)]
*  And so the stocks of many of the American companies are now being used to build the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=237.2s)]
*  American tech companies start to fall. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=242.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=246.76s)]
*  And so after all of this, people in the American tech industry start asking questions. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=249.76s)]
*  Who is DeepSeek and how are they getting these incredible models with so little money spent [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=255.36s)]
*  on them? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=261.36s)]
*  Okay, we're going to get to those questions of who this company is and how they did this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=266.36s)]
*  But I just first want to dig into the anatomy of the market panic. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=272.56s)]
*  What are the real fears driving this? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=277.0s)]
*  So it depends who you ask, because there are a couple kind of overlapping panics that are [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=280.56s)]
*  starting to happen around this time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=285.08s)]
*  Of course, again, there's the investor panic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=287.44s)]
*  I mean, imagine if you had your whole portfolio invested in American AI companies. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  It would be like if you just bought like a very high end sports car, like a Lamborghini. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  And you had been driving it around and were so proud of how fast it could accelerate and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=303.12s)]
*  how well it handled. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  And then like some random guy shows up with like a soapbox car made of balsa wood, and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  it can go just as fast as your car. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  You'd be like, what the heck? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  Why did I just spend all this money on this Lamborghini? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=320.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=323.0s)]
*  And should I maybe be investing in balsa wood cars? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=324.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=327.16s)]
*  And then of course, there's the geopolitical freakout because DeepSeek is a Chinese AI [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=328.24s)]
*  company. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=333.0s)]
*  And there has been this race happening between primarily the US and China for years about [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=334.0s)]
*  AI and AI supremacy. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=340.24s)]
*  Who was going to be able to build the most powerful AI models before the other one? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=342.84s)]
*  And that is a very important question for things like assessing the future of military [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=348.44s)]
*  conflict. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=353.36s)]
*  If a country's AI is way better than another country's AI, they might have an advantage. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=354.52000000000004s)]
*  In fact, the US has banned the export of the most powerful AI chips to China for exactly [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=359.0s)]
*  this reason, to try to sort of hobble the Chinese AI companies to keep them from catching [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=365.68s)]
*  up when it comes to building the bleeding edge models that could become very important. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=372.36s)]
*  So instead, DeepSeek had to kind of make do with these like Kirkland signature chips that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  are, you know, pretty good, but they're not the best. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=383.28s)]
*  And so that combined with the amount of money spent really made people say, how do they [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=385.96s)]
*  pull this thing off? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=390.4s)]
*  Kevin, it certainly seems that at least based on what DeepSeek is saying, it has managed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  to pull off a pretty impressive feat here. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=397.8s)]
*  But I'm wondering, can we trust what the company says? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  Can we trust their claims about how they pulled this off? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so there are a lot of people who are skeptical of what DeepSeek has claimed, in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=409.52s)]
*  particular, the cost of the model. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=414.67999999999995s)]
*  Five point five million dollars might not be the real figure. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=417.2s)]
*  It doesn't include all of the research and the engineer salaries and things that went [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=420.11999999999995s)]
*  into that. So that the real cost is probably significantly higher than that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=424.44s)]
*  But there are questions about, you know, did they smuggle in very powerful chips that would [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=428.55999999999995s)]
*  have actually allowed them to build a model this good? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  Is there something going on? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=437.76s)]
*  Is the Chinese government funneling money to them and not telling us about it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=439.0s)]
*  So there are lots of theories. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=443.56s)]
*  But then as time wears on and people who are experts in this stuff start digging through [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=444.76s)]
*  the details, they're coming to the conclusion that, well, yeah, maybe the cost is a little [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=449.56s)]
*  higher than DeepSeek claims. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=455.64s)]
*  Maybe they have a few more chips than they're telling us about. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=457.68s)]
*  But in general, this seems like they actually just did build a really good model using some [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=461.44s)]
*  very clever engineering techniques. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=466.6s)]
*  OK, so let's talk about those engineering techniques. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=468.68s)]
*  I mean, how actually did DeepSeek do this? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=471.88s)]
*  Make a chatbot on a shoestring budget potentially with second rate chips? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=474.92s)]
*  So because DeepSeek did not have access, we don't think, to the most powerful chips that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  American companies are using. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=487.16s)]
*  They had to kind of get clever about becoming more efficient with their model. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=489.08000000000004s)]
*  I won't bore you with the technical details. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=494.12s)]
*  It includes terms like mixture of experts architecture. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  But basically, they were able to use some clever tricks to squeeze the most power out [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=499.8s)]
*  of the chips that they did have. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  And it occurs to me, Kevin, that this company was operating under a lot of constraints. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  And it sounds like that may have forced the engineers to think about how to tackle this [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=513.12s)]
*  problem differently. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=517.6s)]
*  As in, it seems possible that not having these critical ingredients actually bred [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=519.2s)]
*  innovation. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=524.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's this saying in the tech industry that constraints inspire creativity. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=525.8s)]
*  And that is definitely true here. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=531.92s)]
*  DeepSeek did not have access to the best American AI chips. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=535.08s)]
*  They did not have the largest budget or the most sophisticated team. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=539.68s)]
*  But they were really scrappy and smart. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=545.84s)]
*  They had a lot of really good young engineers and they were able to pull this off. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=548.88s)]
*  So, Kevin, how do the big American tech companies contend with that? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=554.76s)]
*  I mean, what do they say to investors who are wondering about whether maybe these companies [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  have been throwing money away when some of this work on these AI models could have been [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  done much more cheaply? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=568.8s)]
*  So what the AI companies in America are saying in response to this market panic is, look, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=571.5999999999999s)]
*  we've still got to build these big, expensive supercomputers to stay at the forefront of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  AI, to have the best models. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=584.5999999999999s)]
*  And if we take the techniques that DeepSeek has now shown are possible, these efficiency [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  gains, we could have them, too. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=592.28s)]
*  Think about how powerful our models would be if we put a billion dollars into the same [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=594.4s)]
*  kind of model that DeepSeek was able to make for much less. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=599.64s)]
*  So that is what the American AI companies are saying. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=602.76s)]
*  But I think there are real questions among investors about whether the scale of investment [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=605.28s)]
*  that they have been planning is really necessary. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=610.68s)]
*  And for you, Kevin, I mean, obviously you've been covering this world for a very long time. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=613.56s)]
*  Does that show you that more money doesn't necessarily mean more innovation in the world [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=618.72s)]
*  of AI, where more money has been kind of a given, you know, as an assumption of what's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=625.64s)]
*  needed? I mean, does it actually suggest that maybe smaller, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=630.72s)]
*  as you said, scrappier startups could make huge gains in this world? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=635.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think it threw into question this fundamental assumption that only the big dogs [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=639.36s)]
*  could play in AI. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=645.6s)]
*  Right. You had to be Microsoft or Amazon or Google if you wanted a chance to build the [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=647.12s)]
*  state of the art AI models. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=652.52s)]
*  And I think what the DeepSeek story suggested is that there may be a whole other world of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=654.6s)]
*  competitors out there trying to stay close to the frontier and that they might not have [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=661.28s)]
*  to have the resources of one of the world's largest corporations to do it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=666.96s)]
*  But there was one other piece of this that I think really suggests that the AI race has [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=671.2s)]
*  entered a new phase, which is that DeepSeek did something that a lot of American companies [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=676.44s)]
*  have been hesitant to do, which is that they released their AI models as open source [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=681.08s)]
*  software, meaning that anyone on the Internet can download and use, can make their own [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=685.84s)]
*  versions of, can adapt, can tweak. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=692.5600000000001s)]
*  It is software that can be reused and remixed and improved upon by anyone. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=695.2800000000001s)]
*  And so when DeepSeek released its models this way, they really sent a message to the world [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=701.48s)]
*  that says, we are serious here about competing and we're so serious that we're going to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=707.84s)]
*  give away our models for free so that anyone who wants to can make them better. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=713.4s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, it just flipped the entire AI race onto its head and really sent [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=718.72s)]
*  it into a new gear. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=724.04s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=734.84s)]
*  Kevin, it sounds like DeepSeek has already or is about to really change the landscape of [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=735.76s)]
*  AI. And my question is, is that good? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=750.36s)]
*  Like for people like you and me, I mean, maybe you more than me who use chatbots for [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=755.4s)]
*  consumers. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=761.24s)]
*  So it's a complicated question to answer because there are ways in which it is probably [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=763.12s)]
*  good and ways in which it is probably bad. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=768.76s)]
*  The case that this is a good thing is that in general, when you make things cheaper, they [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=771.5600000000001s)]
*  can be accessible to more people. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=776.36s)]
*  I mean, remember DeepSeek is not just free to use in the app or on the website. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=778.44s)]
*  It was also released as open source software, meaning that anyone with an Internet connection [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=783.6s)]
*  can download it and install it on their own computers or maybe tweak it to serve their [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  own purposes. So if you are a person who wants to use AI, maybe you have a small business [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=793.96s)]
*  or maybe you just want to use this to help you write letters or emails. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=800.44s)]
*  Maybe you're a student who wants to use this. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=806.24s)]
*  You can now access a very powerful model for free. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=808.6800000000001s)]
*  Maybe you are a developer or a startup who wants to build your own AI tools. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=812.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, now you have this DeepSeek model that you can kind of take off the shelf as open [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=816.84s)]
*  source software and build your own version of it or run it on your own hardware. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=821.72s)]
*  And so the people that I talk to in the tech industry who are at startups or smaller [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=826.76s)]
*  companies are very excited about this. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=830.84s)]
*  This is a great development for them. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=832.76s)]
*  And it also means that if you are a person who worries that all the AI power is going to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=835.08s)]
*  go to a few huge companies, then the democratization of AI through open source models like DeepSeek [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=840.36s)]
*  probably makes you feel optimistic. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=849.8s)]
*  So that is the positive case for this. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=852.04s)]
*  But there are also a lot of people who are really worried about what DeepSeek has done. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=855.0799999999999s)]
*  I think the DeepSeek moment has really sparked a lot of new fears about how quickly this [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=859.76s)]
*  whole field of AI is progressing. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=866.12s)]
*  I mean, just in the last few years, the leading AI models have gone from maybe being as smart [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=869.16s)]
*  as the average high school student to as smart as a college student to now being able to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=875.48s)]
*  complete a lot of tasks that would have taken a Ph.D. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=880.92s)]
*  to complete. So these models are just getting much better very quickly. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=884.0s)]
*  And a lot of folks in the AI community are just nervous about that. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=889.76s)]
*  They say things like, well, maybe we're going to get an AI that is as smart as the smartest [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=895.04s)]
*  humans in just a few years. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=900.96s)]
*  And we don't really have a playbook for dealing with technology that is more intelligent [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=903.0s)]
*  than us. And so there are people who worry about these sort of runaway AI scenarios where [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=909.72s)]
*  you get super intelligent AIs that can sort of take control or maybe even harm humans. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=915.36s)]
*  But even if you're not a believer in that kind of superhuman intelligence risk, there [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=922.1999999999999s)]
*  are just a lot of questions about whether we as a society are ready for advanced AI. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=927.88s)]
*  Are we ready for the possibility that it could eliminate jobs? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=934.5999999999999s)]
*  Are we ready for the possibility that it could really lead to a proliferation of misinformation [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=937.64s)]
*  or propaganda or even automated cyber attacks and things like that? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=943.8s)]
*  So all of that is swirling around the conversation about DeepSeek because we have just [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=947.52s)]
*  accelerated the AI race again. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=953.36s)]
*  And now it is not just American companies competing with each other over who is in the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=955.12s)]
*  lead of that race. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=960.36s)]
*  China has also stepped in and there's a lot of fear and anxiety about what happens if [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=962.16s)]
*  we fall behind. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=967.0s)]
*  Kevin, if this really is that important of a moment in the global AI arms race, how [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=968.4s)]
*  should we expect the United States to react? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=975.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, does the U.S. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=977.96s)]
*  government just ban this thing? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=979.5200000000001s)]
*  You know, we saw TikTok banned because it was owned by a Chinese company. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=981.4000000000001s)]
*  Is that the move here? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=985.36s)]
*  Well, it may well be because if you're a person who believes that TikTok is a national [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=988.1600000000001s)]
*  security threat, there's nothing about DeepSeek that is less of a threat, right? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=993.1600000000001s)]
*  It is a Chinese company. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=997.36s)]
*  It is subject to all the same laws and censorship guidelines as other Chinese software [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=998.5600000000001s)]
*  companies are. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1004.1600000000001s)]
*  So, for example, if you ask DeepSeek to tell you what happened at Tiananmen Square or [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1004.84s)]
*  to say something mean about Xi Jinping, the leader of China, it won't do it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1010.2800000000001s)]
*  And I would not be surprised if in the coming weeks and months we do see lawmakers in [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1015.76s)]
*  the U.S. saying, wait a minute, we passed a law to ban TikTok. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  Why are we not also passing a law to ban DeepSeek? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1026.1200000000001s)]
*  So I think that's one potential outcome here. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1028.6000000000001s)]
*  But there's a key difference, which is that TikTok is not open source software. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1031.32s)]
*  You cannot download TikTok and create your own version of it. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1035.56s)]
*  And so already the DeepSeek models have been downloaded and recreated all over the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1039.12s)]
*  world by lots and lots of different people and companies. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1046.2s)]
*  And so I think what the DeepSeek story suggests is that it is going to be quite [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1050.6s)]
*  challenging to contain the spread of powerful AI without some big moves. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1055.56s)]
*  Kevin, if we really are past that point of containment here, if we're off to the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1061.32s)]
*  races, does it matter that this innovation happened in China by a Chinese company? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1066.32s)]
*  I mean, isn't this bigger than that at this point? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1071.76s)]
*  So there are people in the American tech scene who are calling this DeepSeek moment [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1076.44s)]
*  the Sputnik moment for the AI race, because just as the launch of Sputnik by the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1082.08s)]
*  Soviet Union kicked off the 20th century space race and created profound fear and [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1087.92s)]
*  anxiety among Western nations about whether they were behind their biggest [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1094.0800000000002s)]
*  political adversary when it came to technology. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1099.2s)]
*  A lot of people are looking at this moment with DeepSeek as kicking off a new era in [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1102.3600000000001s)]
*  the AI race where we really want to stay ahead of China. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1106.92s)]
*  And there are people who say that having a lead in AI, if you are the United States, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1112.0s)]
*  even if it's just a lead of a couple months or a couple years over your political [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1118.48s)]
*  adversaries is very important. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1123.5600000000002s)]
*  And that may be true, but people who study AI, people who look at this industry closely, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1126.5600000000002s)]
*  who are paying attention to the trends in AI, believed that these models would become [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1133.76s)]
*  cheaper and cheaper over time, as well as becoming more powerful over time. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1139.4s)]
*  So this really fits neatly with a lot of what people had been predicting for years. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1144.9199999999998s)]
*  Now, they might not have predicted that this sort of moment would happen from a Chinese [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1149.8799999999999s)]
*  AI company. They might not have predicted exactly what the breakthroughs would be that [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1154.04s)]
*  allowed for the models to get cheaper. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1158.0s)]
*  But this is in keeping with the overall trend in AI that we've seen over the past few [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1159.72s)]
*  years, which is that the models keep getting better and they keep getting more efficient. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1164.24s)]
*  In a way, it kind of follows the normal progression of any new product, right? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1168.72s)]
*  Like, at first, it's expensive and then more and more competition leads to innovation. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1172.32s)]
*  The thing gets cheaper. Everything becomes more democratized. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1176.96s)]
*  Yeah. So that is what happened here, but just maybe a little faster than people had [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1181.04s)]
*  expected. But I think the larger point is that these systems are now improving so [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1185.3999999999999s)]
*  rapidly and in so many places all at once that I think it is only a matter of time [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1191.56s)]
*  before nearly everyone in the world has access to very powerful AI models. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1197.84s)]
*  And I just think that world looks a lot different than the one we live in today. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1205.2s)]
*  Kevin, thank you so much. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1212.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1215.44s)]

*  On Saturday, President Trump declared tariffs of 25 percent on all goods from Canada and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1233.8799999999999s)]
*  Mexico with a partial carve out for Canadian energy and oil exports. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1239.36s)]

*  America's largest trading partners. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1257.96s)]
*  Those countries responded swiftly to Trump's announcement. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1261.0s)]
*  The Canadian government detailed its own retaliatory 25 percent tariffs on more than [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1265.08s)]
*  100 billion dollars worth of U.S. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1269.76s)]
*  goods, including everything from American made honey, tomatoes and whiskey to [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  refrigerators and toilets. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1277.0s)]
*  President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said she would unveil her country's response on [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1278.84s)]
*  Monday, while China's Commerce Ministry promised to bring a legal case at the World [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1282.6399999999999s)]
*  Trade Organization and quote, corresponding countermeasures. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1287.28s)]
*  President Trump acknowledged on social media that his tariffs could cause, quote, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1293.1599999999999s)]
*  some pain, but said it would be, quote, worth the price that must be paid. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1296.8799999999999s)]
*  And in a new effort to tighten the immigration system, the Trump administration [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1303.24s)]
*  is ending temporary protected status for 300,000 Venezuelan migrants in the United [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1307.24s)]
*  States, according to government documents obtained by the Times. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1312.72s)]
*  The move could make those migrants vulnerable to potential deportation in the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1317.0s)]
*  coming months. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1321.0s)]

*  dangerous situations in their home countries. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1327.4s)]
*  But Republican critics have said it allowed migrants to stay in the United States for [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaCGz2hAPeo&t=1330.72s)]
