# Trump Takes Aim at the Department of Education
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Kim Severson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=4.24s)]
*  In the coming days, President Trump is expected to sign an executive order that would, at [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=5.88s)]
*  least on paper, follow through on one of his major campaign promises, to abolish the U.S. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=15.4s)]
*  Department of Education. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=21.2s)]
*  The catch is, he still needs it to impose his vision on American schools. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=23.72s)]
*  Today, my colleague Dana Goldstein, on how Trump is balancing a desire to both dismantle [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=29.72s)]
*  and weaponize the education department. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=36.6s)]
*  It's Monday, March 10th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Dana, over the past few days, we've been hearing that President Trump has plans to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=47.48s)]
*  abolish the Department of Education. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=55.0s)]
*  And even for an administration that's been dismantling agencies across government, this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=57.44s)]
*  felt pretty big. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  You're a veteran education reporter. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=64.19999999999999s)]
*  Talk to us about what's happening. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  So a draft executive order attempting to dismantle the federal Department of Education has been [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=68.56s)]
*  in Washington, and we have seen it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=75.12s)]
*  And it's no surprise to us that this draft is out there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=77.96s)]
*  We've been hearing for many weeks now that President Trump will sign an order like this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=81.24s)]
*  In fact, several times we were sort of poised watching video of him sitting at the Resolute [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=86.2s)]
*  desk in the OVA office with executive orders that he was about to sign, thinking, is this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=91.92s)]
*  the day? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=97.44s)]
*  Is one of these pieces of paper the one that will attempt to abolish the agency? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=98.44s)]
*  And so far, he hasn't done it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=103.94s)]
*  But it does seem that this is something that is in very serious consideration for him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=106.7s)]
*  Okay, this all sounds pretty drastic, eliminating the entire Department of Education. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=112.34s)]
*  And I want to understand why he wants to do that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=118.5s)]
*  But before we get there, it might be helpful to understand, and I hate to admit that I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=121.44s)]
*  don't know this, what exactly is the Department of Education responsible for? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=125.74s)]
*  Well, I think it's important to step back and understand not just what it does, but [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  also what it doesn't do. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  It does not set the curriculum of local public schools or reading lists or decide how many [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=139.5s)]
*  teachers to hire or what teachers are paid or what student discipline policy should be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  or what standardized tests should be given. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=149.82s)]
*  All of that is controlled by state and local governments. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=152.62s)]
*  So there's not like a federal rule about how much history a kid needs to graduate from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=155.7s)]
*  high school. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=160.14s)]
*  And the kids do none of that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=161.14s)]
*  They do not do that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=162.64s)]
*  In fact, 90% of the funding for local schools comes from local and state governments. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  And only about 10% comes from Washington and flows through the federal Department of Education. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=170.01999999999998s)]
*  That 10% is important because it focuses on low-income students and children with disabilities. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  And what a lot of people may not realize is that over 70% of what the Department of Education [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=183.5s)]
*  does is administer the student aid program. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=188.54s)]
*  So grants and loans that help students pay their college tuition. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=191.12s)]
*  And they also fund education research. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=195.12s)]
*  So attempts to figure out what are the best ways to teach students how to read better. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=197.16s)]
*  They fund efforts to measure how American students are doing academically compared to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=202.76s)]
*  students around the world. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  Okay, so we've got loans and research. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=210.52s)]
*  And finally, the last thing they do is enforce anti-discrimination or civil rights laws. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=213.38s)]
*  So these are the laws that attempt to make sure that students are not being discriminated [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=218.22s)]
*  against based on their gender, their race, their ethnicity, their religion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=221.56s)]
*  So for instance, if a school is not giving black or Hispanic students equal access to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=226.42s)]
*  gifted programs or advanced placement classes, they might be investigated. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=231.48s)]
*  And that is very inconvenient. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=236.74s)]
*  It is a pretty big deal for any school system. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=238.38s)]
*  And they would essentially be pressured into changing these practices. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=241.74s)]
*  So if the department got eliminated, would all those things just poof go away? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=249.18s)]
*  Well not really. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=256.6s)]
*  I think we have to say, first of all, that only Congress can vote to abolish a cabinet [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=257.8s)]
*  agency. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=262.16s)]
*  So President Trump, by signing an order like this, does not have the ability to abolish [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=263.3s)]
*  the Department of Education. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=268.14s)]
*  But even if he somehow was able to abolish the department, it's not like all of these [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=270.08s)]
*  functions I just laid out would suddenly cease to exist. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=275.18s)]
*  One way to think of the Department of Education is that it's like a bucket. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=278.92s)]
*  And inside of it are all these programs and money that are appropriated and created by [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=282.7s)]
*  Congress. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=288.18s)]
*  So if you do get rid of this bucket, you still have to deal with all the contents of the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  bucket. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=293.02s)]
*  But why even sign the executive order then? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=294.3s)]
*  I mean, Trump's not exactly Mr. Follow the Law all the time, but this seems pretty open [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=297.02s)]
*  and shut. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=302.3s)]
*  It's a cabinet agency. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=303.3s)]
*  So why sign an executive order abolishing it if it stands to be overturned in the courts? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=305.16s)]
*  You know, in a lot of ways, Kim, it's symbolic. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  And like a lot of these executive orders, it's less about their legal force and more [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  about announcing this administration's priorities. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  This particular order would be allowed and bold way of signaling that this president [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=322.88s)]
*  wants to majorly overhaul education in this country and drastically change the federal [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  government's role. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=332.16s)]
*  What do we imagine overhauling education would look like? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=334.2s)]
*  Well, I think to figure that out, we have to look at what President Trump has actually [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=337.56s)]
*  done so far with the agency, because that gives us a lot of insight into how the next [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  four years will go with him in office when it comes to education. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  OK, so what has happened? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=349.8s)]
*  To get a sense of that, we can actually look at what is going on inside the Department [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=352.52s)]
*  of Education building in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=356.34000000000003s)]
*  There are people in there embedded from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=359.64s)]
*  Group. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=364.64s)]
*  And what they are doing is really looking to slash budgets to decimate the research [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=365.64s)]
*  efforts of the agency. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=371.64s)]
*  They are looking to lay off workers and they have done so. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=373.76s)]
*  And they are looking to replace some human work with artificial intelligence. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  Our reporting showed that they are particularly focused there on the call center that answers [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=382.2s)]
*  students and parents' questions about federal financial aid, which you can imagine is super [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=388.56s)]
*  complex, gets into some really personal and private information about families. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=393.64s)]
*  They are interested in handling way more of that with an AI chatbot, and they are actually [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=399.72s)]
*  attempting to build it internally. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=405.04s)]
*  So they are very busy inside of the Department of Education right now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=407.48s)]
*  OK, so this is part of the overarching idea like streamline the government, take things [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=411.56s)]
*  out of the federal government's hands as much as possible, save a bunch of money, get rid [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=418.56s)]
*  of workers who maybe are perceived to not be needed. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=423.4s)]
*  This is basically kind of a doge operation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=427.12s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=430.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's part of it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=431.28s)]
*  But Kevin's about a lot more than just that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=433.44s)]
*  President Trump has a broader sort of MAGA vision for public education, which is really [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=436.88s)]
*  about battling what he and his allies see as woke ideology that has pervaded the nation's [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  schools around issues like race, gender, sexuality and American history. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=448.08s)]
*  And we are already seeing this play out. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=453.2s)]
*  I will give you a couple of examples. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  Remember that investigative power of the Department of Education that I mentioned, which [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=458.56s)]
*  enforces anti-discrimination laws? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=462.52s)]
*  They, the Trump administration, are already using that power, but in a very different, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  really polar opposite way. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  So for instance, they are investigating the Denver public schools because they had transformed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  a single girls restroom and one high school into a non-binary restroom. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  And they are investigating whether this could potentially be considered a violation of girls [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  civil rights. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  They are looking into the Ithaca public schools, investigating a series of conferences that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  were held there that were for students of color and looking into an allegation that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=498.48s)]
*  white students were not invited to these conferences, which were about diversity issues and considering [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=503.48s)]
*  whether that could be considered a violation of white students' rights. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=509.6s)]
*  And they also, just late last week, President Trump signed an order that would attempt to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=514.24s)]
*  withhold federal student loan forgiveness for public service careers from workers who [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=520.44s)]
*  are working at nonprofit organizations whose policies around immigration or around [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=527.0s)]
*  transgender issues buck President Trump's ideas on those issues. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=532.96s)]
*  So people who took jobs at these nonprofits that Trump doesn't like, with the promise of [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=538.76s)]
*  having their loans forgiven, would no longer get that benefit? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=544.68s)]
*  Well, we don't know if this will stand up legally in the courts, but that is the attempt, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=548.44s)]
*  yes. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=552.6s)]
*  So Trump is already infusing the American education system with his new vision of what [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=553.08s)]
*  public education should be. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=559.36s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=561.44s)]
*  And part of why this is such a big change is that it used to be not that long ago that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=563.08s)]
*  both Republicans and Democrats agreed that the federal government had a big role to play [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=567.96s)]
*  in education and holding schools accountable for doing a good job and educating students [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=572.56s)]
*  and raising test scores in math and in reading. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=578.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=581.16s)]
*  That consensus, which was not really controversial, has fallen apart with President Trump's [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=581.48s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=587.72s)]
*  The new highest value is not raising test scores, not holding schools accountable, but [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=591.72s)]
*  giving as much control as possible to individual parents. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=598.48s)]
*  And in many ways, Kim, this is a vision that is at odds with the very reason the Department [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=603.12s)]
*  of Education was founded to begin with. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=609.52s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=619.64s)]
*  So, Dana, I imagine that when any new administration comes in, the priorities of each [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=628.8s)]
*  department will change a little or even a lot. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=633.72s)]
*  But it sounds like what you're saying with regards to Trump and the Department of [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=637.04s)]
*  Education is that something much deeper and much more fundamental is going on here. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=640.72s)]
*  Help me understand how we got here. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=647.36s)]
*  So the federal government has played a role in education since the 19th century, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=650.16s)]
*  researching education, trying to disseminate best practices for how teachers can do their [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=655.08s)]
*  jobs better. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=661.2s)]
*  But there was no federal Department of Education as a separate cabinet agency until [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=662.72s)]
*  1979. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=668.16s)]
*  And the idea was controversial. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=670.12s)]
*  It was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, but even some Democrats opposed the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=672.44s)]
*  idea. They didn't think it was necessary to have a whole separate bureaucracy to deal [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=677.6800000000001s)]
*  with education issues. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=682.76s)]
*  And for President Ronald Reagan, the Department of Education was a huge sign of federal [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=684.44s)]
*  bloat, and he constantly talked about abolishing it. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=689.48s)]
*  However, over the decades, the Department of Education really became part of the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=693.96s)]
*  firmament in Washington and enjoyed plenty of support from both Republicans and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=700.2s)]
*  Democrats. And that's because the programs that it works on, like Pell Grants that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=706.32s)]
*  help students pay for college and money for disabled students, educational supports and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=713.4s)]
*  public schools are really popular. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=719.24s)]
*  So essentially, the Department of Education got woven into the body politic as we [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=721.72s)]
*  know it, right? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=729.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And for many years, this discussion, which had existed in the 70s [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=730.6s)]
*  and 80s about whether we need it, whether we want it, had kind of quieted down until [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=736.32s)]
*  the point under the Republican president George W. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=741.28s)]
*  Bush in the early 2000s, the Republican Party was really united around the idea of a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=743.92s)]
*  bigger federal role in education. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=749.76s)]
*  Public schools are America's great hope. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=752.28s)]
*  And making them work for every child is America's great duty. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=755.76s)]
*  You know, one of the things that's helpful to remember is that George W. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=761.28s)]
*  Bush, with his idea of compassionate conservatism, was really focused on education. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=764.88s)]
*  Compassionate conservatism places great hope and confidence in public education. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=772.28s)]
*  He had the idea that there was, quote, the soft bigotry, the bigotry of low expectations, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=779.76s)]
*  of low expectations for many students in our nation's public schools, for low income [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=785.68s)]
*  students, for Black and Hispanic and Native American students. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=791.36s)]
*  While all can enter our schools, many, too many, are not learning there. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=795.28s)]
*  And he really wanted to push out standardized tests into the nation's schools so he could [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=802.0s)]
*  measure how kids were doing and require teachers and principals to help kids do better. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=808.04s)]
*  The new education reforms we have passed in Washington give the federal government a [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=813.92s)]
*  new role in public education. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=820.36s)]
*  This was the law no child left behind. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=822.48s)]
*  It is conservative to let local communities chart their own path to excellence. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  It is compassionate to insist that every child learns so that no child is left behind. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  Which, of course, today is remembered for being really controversial. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  Kind of draconian, really. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  Yes, because it required kids to take tests every year in math and reading, and it threatened [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=844.9599999999999s)]
*  to punish schools if the students didn't do well on the tests. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=851.96s)]
*  And so it led to a lot of teaching to the test and nobody likes that. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=855.44s)]
*  Teachers don't like that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=859.36s)]
*  Parents don't like that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=860.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  But it was a really big bipartisan push under a Republican president to strengthen the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=862.96s)]
*  federal role in education. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=870.0400000000001s)]
*  So exactly the opposite of what's going on now with President Trump. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=871.12s)]
*  I always have an image in my mind of what a big issue education was for President George [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=875.36s)]
*  W. Bush. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=881.4s)]
*  He was sitting on the morning of 9-11, 2001, reading a book to public school students. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=882.72s)]
*  And it was part of his general emphasis on education. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=891.0s)]
*  And it was at that moment reading the book to the children that an aide whispered in his [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=894.4s)]
*  ear to inform him of the attack on the World Trade Center. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that is an image that has just seared into the minds of a lot of people. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=902.64s)]
*  OK, so after George W. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=907.56s)]
*  Bush, we come to Obama. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=909.4s)]
*  And what was his vision for American public education? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=911.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, President Obama agreed on a lot of the fundamentals with President Bush. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=915.5999999999999s)]
*  He agreed that the federal government needed to hold schools accountable. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=920.88s)]
*  He wanted to make those tests better and higher quality, but he also added some additional [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=925.04s)]
*  pressure around them. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=930.7199999999999s)]
*  He created incentives for states to evaluate teachers according to how well their individual [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=932.0s)]
*  students did on those tests. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=938.76s)]
*  So in other words, whether you got a positive or negative employee evaluation at the end [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=940.88s)]
*  of the year would be based around this. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=945.6s)]
*  That was also incredibly controversial. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  But it's just notable to talk about how Republican and Democratic presidents for many years [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=950.12s)]
*  were really in support of a big federal role. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=955.12s)]
*  OK, so what happened? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=959.0s)]
*  What changed? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so what happened is that under President Bush and President Obama, all of this emphasis [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=961.7600000000001s)]
*  on standardized testing really became super unpopular. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=967.0s)]
*  Democrats hated it. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=970.72s)]
*  Republicans hated it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=972.0s)]
*  Teachers hated it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=973.4000000000001s)]
*  Parents hated it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=974.48s)]
*  And that's why for years I have called on Congress to come together and get a bipartisan [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=975.72s)]
*  effort to fix No Child Left Behind. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=983.6s)]
*  So in 2015. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=985.8000000000001s)]
*  A Christmas miracle. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=987.6400000000001s)]
*  A bipartisan bill signing right here. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=988.8800000000001s)]
*  President Obama signed a law that was passed by Congress called the Every Student Succeeds [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=991.6400000000001s)]
*  Act. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=996.9200000000001s)]
*  The goals of No Child Left Behind, the predecessor of this law, were the right ones. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=997.5200000000001s)]
*  But in practice, it often fell short. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1004.6400000000001s)]
*  And it rolled back a lot of this federal pressure around teacher evaluation and testing. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1007.8800000000001s)]
*  And it returned a lot of the power over education to states and school districts. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1013.7600000000001s)]
*  It's not as if there weren't some significant ideological differences on some of these issues. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1019.24s)]
*  No, there were. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1024.68s)]
*  But but I think that this is really a good example of how bipartisanship can work. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1025.56s)]
*  Which was the status quo when President Trump came into office for his first term. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1030.88s)]
*  OK, so how did we go from there to where we are now? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1036.16s)]
*  So when President Trump came into office for his first term, he appointed an education [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  secretary, the billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos, who really embodies the term [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1045.8799999999999s)]
*  that Republican politics have taken on education. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1052.04s)]
*  Betsy DeVos was not interested in beefing up public education or beefing up the federal [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1055.36s)]
*  role. She had two main things. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  Cultural conservatism, which was a big interest of hers. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1063.8s)]
*  And also her goal, which she has said many times, was to get as much funding for public [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1066.84s)]
*  schools as possible in the hands of parents so they could make choices to go to private [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1072.56s)]
*  school or homeschool their kids. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1076.56s)]
*  And since then, those ideas have only become much more popular in Republican politics. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1080.0s)]
*  And that's in large part because of the covid pandemic. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1086.76s)]
*  The fields are empty, the playgrounds deserted and all across the United States, school [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  buildings sit empty. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1095.76s)]
*  Remember, schools were shut down in some parts of the country for a year and a half. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1097.28s)]
*  Many parents were angry about that. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1103.04s)]
*  And many parents, when their kids were doing remote learning from home and they watched [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1108.04s)]
*  what was being taught, did not like what they saw. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1112.36s)]
*  Parents rights activists say they oppose critical race theory and explicit books in [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1115.8799999999999s)]
*  school curriculum. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1121.48s)]
*  So the parental rights or parent empowerment movement really took off over the past five [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1122.88s)]
*  years. Don't mess with America's moms. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1128.3600000000001s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1131.76s)]
*  I know groups like Moms for Liberty, for example, was crusading against, you know, what [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1132.8s)]
*  they saw as woke liberal ideology about race. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1139.4s)]
*  I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1143.76s)]
*  race theory, transgender or teaching students about transgender identities and other [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1149.0s)]
*  inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1155.96s)]
*  President Trump astutely observed that this was a powerful cultural movement. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1162.2s)]
*  In addition, I am proud to have laid out by far the most aggressive, most visionary plan [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1167.8s)]
*  to liberate our children from the Marxist lunatics and perverts who have infested our [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1174.16s)]
*  educational system. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  They're perverts. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1180.52s)]
*  And in his campaign for president in 2024, he embraced all of this. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1182.24s)]
*  And I will defend, I can't even believe I have to say this, I will defend parental rights. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1188.92s)]
*  Can you believe it? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1194.92s)]
*  And he has become a lot more sophisticated, we think, in the second term and actually [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1197.4s)]
*  using the federal government to achieve these goals. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1202.72s)]
*  OK, Dana, you told us about the investigations. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1213.28s)]
*  The Department of Education has already opened. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1216.76s)]
*  So Trump is actually embracing the powers of the Department of Education, even as he's [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1220.24s)]
*  talking about eliminating it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1226.56s)]
*  Absolutely, Kim. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  That is the fundamental contradiction here. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1229.72s)]
*  Even as he talks a lot about wanting to dismantle or even abolish the federal Department of [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1232.56s)]
*  Education inside the building with his new education secretary, Linda McMahon, they are [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1238.0800000000002s)]
*  hard at work using the investigative powers of this agency in a muscular way to achieve [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1244.28s)]
*  these sort of culture war goals. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1252.04s)]
*  And I think where this could all end up is that he can drastically cut this agency. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1254.1200000000001s)]
*  He can strip it down. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1261.64s)]
*  He can reduce it and dismantle it and roll some of its responsibilities over to other [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1263.64s)]
*  parts of the federal government. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1269.72s)]
*  But he can keep a core sort of heart of the agency in place that will help him pursue [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1271.4s)]
*  his goals and fulfill his agenda. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1278.3600000000001s)]
*  This feels like a big change. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1281.0400000000002s)]
*  And for many parents who send their kids to public schools, is this should they strap [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1283.5200000000002s)]
*  in for a radical shift in what public school is in America? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1288.56s)]
*  So I don't think that there will be much immediate impact on public school students [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1293.72s)]
*  across the country or educators in K-12 schools. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1300.0s)]
*  And the reason is, as we discussed, the 10 percent of K-12 public school funding that [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1303.6399999999999s)]
*  does come from the federal government is guaranteed to keep flowing unless Congress [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1308.8s)]
*  makes a major change. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1314.52s)]
*  And we don't see that sort of happening right now. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1316.52s)]
*  But I do think that understanding where President Trump's Republican Party is on [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1320.8400000000001s)]
*  education does indicate where state and local education policy may be going, because [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  Republicans across the country share these goals. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1333.44s)]
*  And this, by the way, was all telegraphed in Project 2025. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1337.64s)]
*  Remember that conservative blueprint that came out during the campaign for what should [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1341.8799999999999s)]
*  be done in President Trump's second term in the Project 2025 report. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1347.76s)]
*  They lay out a clear plan for completely abolishing the federal role in K-12 education [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1354.1999999999998s)]
*  over the course of 10 years. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1360.9199999999998s)]
*  Right now, we're just at the beginning of the process that they envision. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1363.6799999999998s)]
*  However, if President Trump's movement is successful, if they keep winning elections, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1369.4s)]
*  if he can bring Republicans in Congress along with his vision, it is possible that down [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1375.88s)]
*  the line, we really would see a vast reduction in federal support for public education. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1382.6s)]
*  And remember, that's going to most impact low income students and students with [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1388.8s)]
*  disabilities, because that's where the money is going. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1393.8s)]
*  Right now, we're still pretty far from that. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1399.04s)]
*  Eighty four percent of American children are in traditional public schools. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1401.48s)]
*  But President Trump's actions on education over the past weeks and months make clear [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1406.2s)]
*  he is driving toward a drastically different vision for education in America. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1412.44s)]
*  Dana, thanks for coming on the show. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1424.24s)]
*  Thank you, Kim. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1425.92s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1429.0s)]
*  Here's what else you should know today. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1447.44s)]
*  On Sunday, Canada's resurgent Liberal Party chose a new leader, Mark Carney, to succeed [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1449.92s)]
*  and to take over the country's response to an ugly trade war with the United States. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1455.8799999999999s)]
*  Carney is a business executive who's never held elected office. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1461.24s)]
*  In his acceptance speech, he took direct aim at President Trump by rejecting Trump's call [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1465.04s)]
*  for Canada to become America's 51st state. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1469.9199999999998s)]
*  America is not Canada. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  And Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way, shape or thing. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1476.12s)]
*  And by declaring that Canada would not shrink from a fight over tariffs. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1482.92s)]
*  We didn't ask for this fight. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1487.0800000000002s)]
*  The Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1489.3600000000001s)]
*  So the Americans, they should make no mistake in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1493.96s)]
*  Carney will become prime minister in the coming days and is expected to quickly call for an [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1502.2s)]
*  election to ride the wave of anti-Trump sentiment that's energized the Liberal Party's [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1506.76s)]
*  recent days. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_hiM83Sc9E&t=1511.44s)]
