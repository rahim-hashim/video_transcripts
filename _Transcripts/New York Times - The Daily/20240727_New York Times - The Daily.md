# 'The Interview' Pete Buttigieg Thinks the Trump Fever Could Break
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzEwG4R9t-g)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview.
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro.
*  It has been, no exaggeration, one of the most consequential and dizzying periods in modern
*  American politics.
*  It began with President Biden's disastrous debate, then came an assassination attempt
*  against former President Trump.
*  A week later, President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed his vice president,
*  Kamala Harris.
*  And now Harris is the de facto Democratic nominee.
*  At warp speed, the dynamics of this entire election have changed, not just for voters,
*  but for party leaders like Pete Buttigieg, who went from being a top Biden surrogate
*  to a top Harris surrogate in hours.
*  Buttigieg is one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party.
*  Nicknamed Mayor Pete, he shot into the limelight when he ran for president in 2020 as the mayor
*  of South Bend, Indiana.
*  He then joined the Biden administration as Secretary of Transportation.
*  But he's also frequently on TV as one of the Democrats' top messengers.
*  Reportedly, he's under consideration to become Harris's running mate.
*  If it happened and they won, he'd be the first openly gay VP.
*  On Thursday, I sat down with Buttigieg to talk about how Biden's decision to drop out
*  changed the race, what took so long, and what's next.
*  And if you noticed that I'm not calling him Secretary Buttigieg or asking anything about
*  his work in the cabinet, it's because there's a law, the Hatch Act, that prevents him from
*  mixing his day job with campaigning.
*  Here's my conversation with Pete Buttigieg.
*  This has been a shocker of a week.
*  And now Democrats find themselves having to kind of build the plane while they're flying
*  it.
*  They're not just campaigning the race, they're having to introduce a new candidate, they're
*  building momentum in the electorate.
*  What have you found most surprising as you've been out campaigning for Vice President Harris?
*  Well, yeah, we've certainly had one surprise after another these last few weeks.
*  But what's been really interesting is to watch how she has built her campaign so quickly.
*  Now, of course, part of that is that she was already part of the ticket.
*  She's already part of this administration.
*  The overall values are the same.
*  The themes are the same.
*  And yet, she did a lot more than just create a campaign organization or rebrand a campaign
*  organization a day or two.
*  You see her sounding themes that are distinctively hers.
*  And I think seeing that happen so quickly has been really impressive.
*  And it is remarkable that there's been this sudden vibe shift, if you will, in the Democratic
*  Party since Biden dropped out.
*  What do you ascribe that level of enthusiasm to?
*  Well, I think they're excited about what she represents as a messenger.
*  And it's been exciting to have a new focus on the things that we care about.
*  Part of what President Biden did with his very just extraordinary historic selfless
*  choice was he tore down some obstacles that stood between voters and the media and commentators
*  and all of us and focusing on a lot of the issues and the values that I think can propel
*  Democrats to victory.
*  And what I mean by that is all of the things that the election is really about.
*  The chance to have an election that is not just about two candidates, but is about us
*  and how the choices that are going to be made by the next president affect our lives.
*  That's something that is coming through with a new clarity right now.
*  And that, as you described, vibe shift is really extraordinary.
*  There's been kind of a level of joy to the campaign that I think is welcome, not that
*  it won't have incredibly tough moments in the weeks ahead, I'm sure.
*  But it's become yet another point of contrast, I think, between our ticket and the Republican
*  ticket, which seems to really lean into this death match conception of what politics is.
*  Tear down obstacles.
*  I mean, the obstacle many would say was President Biden himself to this moment.
*  A New Times poll shows that over 80% of voters are happy that Biden dropped out.
*  Clearly voters were hungering for something different.
*  I mean, why did the party ignore that desire for change for so long?
*  Well, I think this is something the party was wrestling with for a long time.
*  And then the president wrestled with it personally.
*  And then he did something that is, it is world historically rare for not just the leader
*  but the most powerful person in the world to lay power aside.
*  And it was really moving to watch in his speech the way he explained his thinking and said
*  that this is not about me, it's about you.
*  But at the same time, I also think his choice consolidated his standing, his presidency,
*  and his legacy in a way that makes me proud of him.
*  I want to talk about that decision.
*  I first want to just ask you about how the decision came about because, you know, CNN
*  reported that there haven't been any full cabinet meetings since late last year.
*  And so I don't know how often you were meeting with President Biden himself, but as a surrogate,
*  did you not have any questions or doubts about his abilities?
*  You know, last time I was working with President Biden really closely was during a disaster
*  a few months ago.
*  I'm reminding myself I'm not supposed to appear in my official capacity, so I won't delve
*  into that.
*  But look, nobody's denying that he's 10 years older than he was 10 years ago.
*  And unlike what you see in the Trump personality cult, we're not going around saying that he
*  leaps tall buildings in a single bound and as strong as an ox.
*  The point is that he's really good at being president and in my view still is.
*  Hearing you, you have framed it as he sacrificed for his country, that this was a noble act
*  But the reality was that he was facing sliding polling numbers.
*  He saw a defection of donors and members of his party.
*  He could have made that choice weeks ago, giving Vice President Harris or any eventual
*  nominee a much longer runway and time to defeat Donald Trump.
*  And he didn't do it.
*  Did he wait too long?
*  One of the things you sign up for when you go into politics and certainly when you're
*  in high office is everybody else telling you what you should have done.
*  We can all say he should have done this or he should have done the same thing but a different
*  time or should have done it in a different way.
*  But the fact stands that he did an extraordinary thing.
*  In my view, a selfless thing and in my view, the right thing.
*  You know, we in the media were raising legitimate questions about Biden's age and his ability
*  to run.
*  And yet reporters were being excoriated by the campaign for asking those questions and
*  by Biden in public.
*  How do those attacks on the press sit with you now knowing what we know?
*  Well, look, I've never participated in an attack on the press.
*  I think that it is natural to feel strong, passionate, defensive even about the person
*  you believe in when you feel like they're being attacked, especially when you feel like
*  they're being attacked unfairly.
*  And there were a lot of moments where there was a sense.
*  Well certain dimensions I think were unfair.
*  For example, the fact that in a given day you might have almost identical flubbing of
*  names by the two major candidates, but only one of them would have that be kind of plastered
*  in certain people's commentary.
*  So there was a sense and look again, it's the nature of being passionate about the person
*  you believe in to come to their defense.
*  But at the end of the day, what happened was one of the most extraordinary and rare things
*  ever.
*  And look, I say this as somebody who has, I have launched campaigns.
*  I know what it's like to end the campaign.
*  And I also know that he did what he feels like is the right thing and what I think is
*  a decision that will allow him to concentrate on the presidency and allow the campaign and
*  the party to concentrate on the campaign.
*  We've seen just Democrats rallying around the VP and we started this conversation by
*  talking about how quickly everything has coalesced.
*  There was a lot of discussion in the weeks after Biden's disappointing debate about what
*  another nomination process could look like.
*  And at the end, it just didn't seem like there was been any appetite for an open convention,
*  a more competitive process among Democrats.
*  Why do you think that is?
*  I think a lot of people looked at her, looked at what she brought, looked at the importance
*  of quickly bringing the party together and reach that conclusion that backing her was
*  the best way to do that.
*  And again, I know a little bit about this.
*  I remember making the toughest decision of my personal political career, which was the
*  decision to end my presidential campaign and realizing that even though I wasn't a candidate
*  anymore, what I did mattered.
*  And I had a responsibility to try to do what I could to lead to a good outcome.
*  That led me to decide very quickly to back President Biden's campaign.
*  And this felt like a similar moment where, you know, whether it was by dint of being
*  in office or just being somebody with a platform, there were a lot of people who had a lot of
*  influence and therefore a lot of responsibility.
*  And just about everybody decided the best way to use that influence and responsibility
*  was to help bring the party together quickly.
*  I mean, it's good politics.
*  Do you think people actually came to these conclusions individually?
*  Was there a sense from the party leadership that everyone needed to fall in line?
*  Well, Democrats are not exactly famous for falling in line when when we do something
*  like coalesce that quickly.
*  I think it's because there's a real sense up and down and throughout the party that
*  it's the right thing to do.
*  I've actually I'm not sure I've ever seen us this quickly unify around anything.
*  I mean, switching up the ticket has offered Democrats this chance to reset not just on
*  the person, but on the message and the policies.
*  President Biden, for example, has taken a lot of heat for his handling of the war in
*  Gaza, inflation, the border.
*  Would you like to see the Harris campaign differentiating itself on those particular
*  issues?
*  Well, I'll leave it to her to indicate where there will be continuity and where she might
*  have a different approach or maybe just a different emphasis.
*  What would you like to see?
*  Well, I'd like to see her reach those concerns that Americans have.
*  So on something like inflation, for example, I think she's well positioned not just to
*  explain how she's contributed to the work that brought inflation back down to three
*  percent in this country, but also the difference between her economic proposals and the
*  clearly inflationary proposals of Donald Trump.
*  And this is really important because it's actually an example of any of the issues you
*  just mentioned, where even if there is impatience among the American people or the American
*  people don't think we got it perfectly right.
*  Even on these issues, they disagree with Donald Trump's approach and on terms of what
*  to do next would generally favor what we propose more than what he proposes to do next.
*  What you're saying, I mean, nothing has fundamentally changed about the Democratic message
*  here, which is that things are getting better.
*  The inflation has gone down under President Biden.
*  I mean, that's been something that the Democratic Party has been trying to run on and push
*  over and over and over again.
*  And yet, poll after poll shows that more people trust former President Trump on these
*  issues than President Biden.
*  Are you suggesting that now because it's a new candidate, Kamala Harris can reset and
*  people will just forget that she was part of the administration?
*  What I'm saying is that part of what a candidate does, part of what a messenger does is
*  convince people of things.
*  And I think she's a very convincing leader.
*  There's been this discussion about how to define Kamala Harris now.
*  Right. And so part of what Democrats like yourself and others are trying to do is, you
*  know, show her for who she wants to be as the next president of the United States.
*  And the right, meanwhile, is trying to portray Kamala Harris as this far left extension of
*  the failures of the Biden administration.
*  And they're also using a lot of sexist and racist attacks.
*  They're calling her a DEI hire and worse stuff that I don't want to repeat.
*  And I just wonder as a surrogate how you combat that.
*  Well, I do think that those attacks have been a bad look for Republicans.
*  And you can tell because when you got somebody like Mike Johnson, who is a very, very
*  conservative figure, right, the Speaker of the House, telling his own caucus, like, hey,
*  cool it. He's basically saying that they are embarrassing the party and I think acknowledging
*  that they are diminishing the party's chances by indulging in that kind of rhetoric.
*  And the fact that they can't think of what else to do besides go right to race and
*  gender isn't just revealing about some of the ugliest undercurrents in today's Republican
*  party. It's also just profoundly unimaginative because it means that they can't speak to how
*  any of this is going to make people's lives better.
*  In other words, certainly not Trump's campaign or Trump's party.
*  They can't conceive a politics that isn't just about the personalities.
*  So everything he does is he beats his chest about his own persona and he tears down his
*  opponent. None of that is about us.
*  None of it's about you. And that's, again, why their inability to do that, their inability to
*  explain how your life as an American every day will be any different, certainly any better, is
*  revealed in the fact that they immediately reach for one of two things, saying she's too far
*  left, which is what literally every Republican says about literally any Democrat who is running
*  against the Republicans. If Joe Manchin were the nominee, they'd say the same thing about him.
*  It's just standard and therefore boring.
*  Or these really ugly attacks, which maybe are meant to get attention, but they are very much
*  telling on themselves when they go there.
*  OK, Pete, you are clearly one of the party's best communicators.
*  You can deliver a message. You have been very on message while we've been talking.
*  I am thinking about how you see your role right now, because, you know, while Biden rarely
*  talked to the press, you not only engage with people like me, but you also go to Fox News.
*  And I am wondering why you do that.
*  What is it about taking the message there that you find could move the needle?
*  Well, the reason I think it's so important to take the message there is because I know that there
*  are so many people who tune in in good faith.
*  I don't always feel that the corporation that runs Fox News is acting in good faith, but I know that
*  the viewers, because they're people I know, I mean, my neighbors in Michigan, might be tuning in in
*  good faith and getting their information from this news source.
*  So I, as a political figure, can hardly blame a voter for not being responsive to our message if they
*  literally have never heard it.
*  And we're in a very fragmented environment.
*  Honestly, we're lucky if we can get to somebody through TV versus just even more fragmented
*  Internet sources.
*  And I know that if I'm on that network, I'm one of relatively few voices with our message.
*  And so if I didn't go there to give that message, somebody might literally never hear it.
*  I also know that you cannot assume who somebody is or how they're going to vote just based on what
*  network they watch.
*  Of course, there's a lot of strong patterns, but there's a lot of people who can be moved.
*  And sometimes the person who picked the channel is not the same as the other person who's also in
*  the House who's listening to what's being said.
*  And so I think there's a responsibility to take this message into those spaces.
*  Just as, you know, when I was running for president, I did it geographically, too.
*  And in Iowa, really kind of specialized in counties that had voted for Barack Obama, but then had
*  turned around and voted for Donald Trump.
*  And those counties were ones where I did well in because they were ready to listen, because they
*  suddenly became more progressive or because I pretended to be a full-throated conservative.
*  But just because sometimes when you explain what you believe to somebody, even if they don't
*  completely agree with you, they respect you more and are inclined to maybe trust you and give you
*  the benefit of the doubt.
*  So that's why I'm there.
*  Do you think the vice president should go on Fox?
*  Do you think she should debate on Fox?
*  I would be skeptical of the fairness of a debate hosted by Fox, but that's a decision that I'm
*  sure she and the campaign will think through.
*  I do want to ask you about a specific shift in messaging I've noticed this week from the
*  Democrats. The Harris campaign is leaning into the idea that Trump is, quote, weird.
*  I've seen this weird word floating around.
*  It's very different from the way Democrats had framed him before, which is that he's an
*  existential threat to democracy, this terrifying figure that is going to take away people's
*  rights. Weird seems a different tack than that.
*  What do you think of that strategy of basically laughing at him?
*  Well, to be clear, I think we're doing both.
*  We're talking about the implications for democracy and noting that he is obviously a
*  strange person who's getting stranger.
*  I mean, I think one of the things that especially now that we have a generational difference
*  between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, who's a generation older, is that we're watching
*  his trajectory. Not that he was ever the most disciplined and straightforward person, but
*  four years ago, even I would be still taken aback if he was rambling about electrocuting
*  sharks and all these other things you see him doing that really are weird.
*  And you got to ask yourself, is that the kind of person you want in charge of the country,
*  especially because we saw how not just weird, but chaotic it was last time.
*  Part of the promise of a Kamala Harris presidency is actually the prospect of a
*  comparatively normal Republican Party.
*  What I mean by that is, you know, beating Donald Trump the first time in 2020 ended his
*  term, but it did not end his grip on the GOP.
*  Beating him twice would, I think, have a different effect on a lot of people in the GOP who
*  know better than to be on board with him.
*  He goes against their values, too, not just my values, but they've gone along with it
*  because they think it's the path to power.
*  And it would become abundantly clear that that is not true if we beat him, not just the
*  way we beat him in 2020, not just the way we indirectly beat him in 2022 in the midterms,
*  but beat him a second or so to speak, third time.
*  And we will always have fierce and meaningful disagreements between Democrats and
*  Republicans. But there's a chance of that difference, those debates being a little less
*  ugly or, to put it another way, a little less weird.
*  What I'm hearing you say, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that if Donald Trump is
*  defeated in this election, then perhaps the Republican Party can be freed from his grip?
*  I think so. I think so.
*  Look, I made myself watch the first couple Republican presidential debates.
*  We still had a lot of Republican candidates this cycle.
*  And there were still some some things that I thought were pretty fringe.
*  And just about everything I heard I disagreed with.
*  But apart from some of the darkness of Vivek's populism, most of what you saw on there, you
*  could be forgiven for thinking you were looking at a more normal Republican Party, were it
*  not for the fact that the entire thing was an undercard because Donald Trump wasn't there
*  and he wasn't his dominating the party.
*  Look, we have fooled ourselves many times before into thinking that the fever would
*  break. And I think that's the only way we can get out of this.
*  We thought it would happen before he was elected, when the Access Hollywood tape revealed that
*  he had boasted about sexual assault.
*  We thought it would happen when he was defeated, but he wasn't in 2016.
*  We thought it might happen after January 6, and it very, very nearly did.
*  So many of the people who are now kissing up to him basically turned their back on him.
*  Then it felt we got so close to the fever breaking, but it didn't quite break because
*  Republicans found that their access to power still depended on their standing with Donald
*  Trump. If he leads this party to defeat a third time after his defeat in 2020 and his
*  party's defeat in 2022, I believe that the self-interest, just the internal power dynamics
*  of the GOP, the very power dynamics that have kept them enthralled to him, even though so
*  many of them know better.
*  Notably, including, by the way, J.D. Vance, who back when he was speaking truthfully and for
*  himself, referred to Donald Trump as an idiot and compared him to an opioid, which is an
*  exceptionally dark thing to say about somebody if you are from or connected to Appalachia as J.D.
*  Vance is, right? And that was in public and private comparing him to Hitler and now turning
*  around supporting him. But my point is, all of that finally breaks loose if they realize that
*  attaching yourself to Donald Trump doesn't just destroy your character, it destroys your
*  access to power.
*  You know, you've talked about this fever breaking that you have an appetite for, but we just had
*  an assassination attempt against former President Trump. And he got off off the floor and he raised
*  his fist in the air with the American flag waving in the background. And he said, fight,
*  fight, fight. And his popularity now in more recent polls has gone up. People see him as someone
*  who takes his licks and keeps on ticking. And that speaks to, for some people, real fundamental
*  American values about being tough and not caving into intimidation. And so I'm just wondering if
*  you think that a moment like that, you know, really breaks through to people and makes him seem
*  fundamentally different than the way that you're describing him, which is weird and aging and
*  vindictive, et cetera.
*  Well, I think lots of things can be true at the same time. That was an extraordinary image. And
*  it is true that he was injured in an attempt on his life and he got right back up. And that's why
*  that image is so powerful. But it doesn't change the fact that he has shown himself to be vindictive
*  and backward looking and more interested in his past than in our future. And I would add, there
*  was a moment in the wake of that horrifying moment. There was a sense that he would follow that up by
*  taking the stage at the RNC in Milwaukee and demonstrating his capacity to help bring this
*  country together. And for a few minutes, he stuck to the script and it looked like that was going
*  to happen. And then the next hour and a half happened. And it was as backward looking and
*  rage filled and self-obsessed as anything he would have been saying one year or three years or five
*  years ago.
*  You mentioned JD Vance. And I do want to also ask you about him. Even though your politics are very
*  far apart, you do share a lot on paper. You're both Midwesterners. You both served in the military.
*  You ended up in elite places for school. And then you spent time in the business world before
*  becoming politicians. Does that give you any special perspective on him as a person?
*  Well, I've certainly encountered a lot of people like him. And I think he and I both or each
*  emerged at a time when a lot of people in the Midwest began to find that commentators and
*  figures from the coasts were kind of approaching our part of the country,
*  almost like we were these kind of almost with exotic fascination. And at least in my case,
*  I sought to engage that attention as a way to bring support to the city that I was leading
*  as mayor, that I was trying to inspire people to believe in because there's actually a lot of
*  creativity and innovation. I think in a different way, he chased that same vibe. It seems to have
*  led him to Silicon Valley, but then it led him to this place where he's advancing a vision that is
*  terrible for places like where I come from. And I would argue where he comes from. But the other
*  thing I would say is, he has traded on fascination about Midwestern stories and Midwestern values,
*  but the most important Midwestern value I know of is to be straightforward, to be true to yourself,
*  to be true to your core. And because he spoke unequivocally about how sinister and unfit Donald
*  Trump was just a few years ago, only to flip around, embrace him and be on his ticket so that
*  he can have more power. People are wondering if he has any core at all. Have you read Hillbilly
*  Elegy? It's one of those books that I own, but haven't read. Just to be honest,
*  I've dipped into it. I haven't read it cover to cover. Speaking of vice presidents,
*  the next big decision, of course, for Harris is who her own VP is going to be. And in a recent
*  NPR PBS Marist poll, I'm sure you know this, you are tied with Michigan Governor Gretchen
*  Whitmer as the most popular person for the VP pick. I know you're not going to tell me
*  if you want the job or not, but do you think you'd be a good vice president?
*  I don't think it's appropriate for me to talk like that knowing that the person who needs to
*  make that decision is the person who's going to make it, and that's her, not me. What I will say
*  is I'm going to do everything I can to help her become the next president.
*  Would you like to be vice president?
*  Again, I don't think it's appropriate for me to wander down that path with you right now.
*  What would it mean, though, to have an openly gay vice president?
*  I think just as it does in the job I'm in now, just as it did as mayor or to run for president
*  as someone who's openly gay, it means that what used to be an indomitable barrier isn't anymore.
*  As recently as 10 years ago, I think any knowledgeable person would have said that the
*  idea of an openly gay person pursuing a presidential campaign and getting anywhere was not just uphill,
*  it was preposterous. 15 years ago when I took the oath of commission to join the military,
*  it wasn't just some unfortunate prejudicial norm, it was the law of this country that I would be
*  fired for being gay. That's changed. And like anybody who is a first, I'm mindful of what that
*  means and I try to live up to what that might mean to others. It's not why I'm doing this work,
*  but it's one more reason to take it seriously. Whoever the VP is, identity is going to play
*  a huge part in the race. Harris would be the first woman of color to lead a major party ticket.
*  And I will say that many of the black and brown women friends that I have have said to me,
*  you know what, there's no way that you'll be elected. There's like a fatalism there,
*  a cynicism about just how far we've actually come as a country. What would you say about that?
*  I completely get where that comes from. And yet, even in my short career and life,
*  I have seen these impossibilities turn into realities. Things that were, again, not just
*  unlikely, but would have been considered ridiculous have become the norm again and again and again.
*  And not the easy way, I mean, through struggle and persistence.
*  These things can happen, but if that isn't true, then why does she have to choose a white guy as a
*  VP? I mean, that's who's being vetted. Look, she's going to choose, nobody knows more other
*  than maybe Joe Biden. Nobody knows more about the vice presidency than she does. Nobody knows more
*  about the job of running away than she does. That's not the question. The question is about
*  why does she choose? If it isn't true that there is a concern.
*  But this is my answer. What I'm saying is, for very good reasons. She knows what she's doing.
*  She knows the job. She knows what she wants. And she knows the people out there who she's going to
*  want to consider. But again, the other thing I would say, and certainly about her future presidency,
*  which will be historic, is that before something like that happens, people always think it's
*  impossible. So many people thought that in 2008. Anybody who is going to be a first has to overcome
*  that skepticism. Last question. I assume at this point, you know Kamala Harris very well.
*  Do you have any specific story about working with her or something about her as a person that you
*  think voters should know? I think people do know this, but she is not just impressive. She's smart
*  and funny. And the best chances I had to see this were when I was very involved in debate prep. I was
*  asked to effectively play Mike Pence, which is a very strange psychological thing for me to do.
*  But I'm so glad I got to do it because I got to see her in action. And what I love is that that
*  is coming through. So often you hear about politicians. It is true sometimes. I say,
*  this person is really funny and loose, but it just doesn't come through on TV.
*  Or this person is smarter than you would think just watching on TV. But I actually think what's
*  interesting, not just TV, but the internet has picked up on the fact that she has this great sense
*  of humor. And I think it's, by the way, also revealing that the GOP has tried to attack her
*  for it, and that's fallen flat. I mean, even just this idea of sending around images of her laughing
*  as if her joy is something that looks bad. When actually what looks bad is to be the doom and
*  death march Republican Party against a Democratic Party that on one hand is very clear-eyed about
