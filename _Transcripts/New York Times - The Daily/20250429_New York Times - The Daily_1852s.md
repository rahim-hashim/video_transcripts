Video Description: Last year, a historic legal settlement resulted in sweeping rule changes that were supposed to lower the price of buying and selling a home across the country.


But those changes would cost real-estate agents money, and so those agents, it turns out, have found ways around the new rules.


Debra Kamin, who reports on real estate, explains how they did it.


Guest: Debra Kamin (https://www.nytimes.com/by/debra-kamin) , a reporter for the real estate section of The New York Times.


Background reading: 

  •  Home sellers and buyers have accused real-estate agents of blocking lower fees (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/realestate/sellers-buyers-realtors-high-commissions.html) .
  •  The rule change was the result of a legal settlement last year by the National Association of Realtors (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/15/realestate/national-association-realtors-commission-settlement.html) .

# The Housing Market Has New Rules. Realtors Are Evading Them.
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily Report. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=4.66s)]
*  Last year, a historic legal settlement created sweeping new reforms that were supposed to [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=13.02s)]
*  lower the price of buying and selling a home across the country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=19.1s)]
*  But those reforms would cost realtors money, and so those realtors, it turns out, have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=24.86s)]
*  found ways to evade the new reforms. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=31.78s)]
*  My colleague Deborah Kamen explains how they did it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  It's Tuesday, April 29th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=47.1s)]
*  Deborah? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=55.74s)]
*  Michael. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=56.74s)]
*  Welcome back to The Daily. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=57.74s)]
*  It's nice to be here again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=58.74s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=60.06s)]
*  It's really nice to see your face. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=61.06s)]
*  In the flesh. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=62.06s)]
*  In the flesh. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=63.06s)]
*  So a year ago, as many listeners I hope will remember, you came on The Daily to describe [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=64.06s)]
*  this really bombshell legal settlement that was supposed to transform how homes are sold [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=69.9s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=75.74s)]
*  And I want to start by having you remind us what that settlement was all about and why [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=77.86s)]
*  it was we felt wrongly, as it turns out, that this was going to be such a watershed moment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=82.22s)]
*  The expectations were sky high. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=89.78s)]
*  The words that were being used by economists and analysts in the industry, earth-shattering, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=92.62s)]
*  watershed, landmark, the greatest change for the real estate industry since the New Deal, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=97.34s)]
*  things that were really pinning hopes that this was going to shake up a stagnant housing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=102.98s)]
*  market and offer real relief to consumers in the U.S. who desperately need it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=108.22s)]
*  And a lot of that was pinned to the idea that rules were going to be followed to the letter [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=114.26s)]
*  and they were not. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=119.53999999999999s)]
*  So here we are a year later and things have shifted a tiny bit, but we're talking about [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=120.9s)]
*  a drizzle, not a watershed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=124.7s)]
*  Just take us back to the settlement. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=126.14s)]
*  So to take you back to the settlement, we actually have to go back a little bit further [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=127.14s)]
*  to October of 2023 when the National Association of Realtors, which is the trade organization [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=130.94s)]
*  that really oversees the real estate industry, they are the largest trade group in the United [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=136.70000000000002s)]
*  States. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=140.82s)]
*  They are hugely powerful. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=141.82s)]
*  They have a ton of money and a really massive amount of power and influence because of their [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=143.46s)]
*  lobbying arm. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=149.42000000000002s)]
*  You describe them as so powerful that they've trademarked the word real estate agent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  The word realtor, yes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=154.16s)]
*  It is a trademark of NAR. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=155.16s)]
*  So you can only use it if you are a member of this group. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=156.94s)]
*  And they have a lot of members, 1.5 million. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  They have more members than there are houses for sale in the US. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=163.14s)]
*  So we're talking a very big, very powerful group. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=167.18s)]
*  They were sued by a group of home sellers in Missouri. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  The idea behind the lawsuit was that their rules had essentially fixed prices on real [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=173.38s)]
*  estate commissions, inflated them and made it so that real estate commissions were higher [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=178.34s)]
*  than they should have been. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=182.1s)]
*  They did not expect to lose this lawsuit, but they did lose this lawsuit. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=183.66s)]
*  And a jury agreed that they were fixing prices on real estate commissions. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=187.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=190.38s)]
*  And it's a good thing that we had this conversation that that price fixing claim really revolves [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=191.38s)]
*  around the amount of money that you owe the agents that comes out of selling a house. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=196.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=204.26s)]
*  The dreaded 6%. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=205.26s)]
*  It comes out of your pocket if you're selling. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=206.26s)]
*  And anyone who's ever bought or sold a house knows that when you sit down with your agent, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=208.06s)]
*  it's overwhelming, it's confusing, and it gets wonky. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=212.0s)]
*  No one really asks, how are these commissions paid? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=214.46s)]
*  It's just kind of there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=217.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=218.38s)]
*  There are a lot of things to worry about that you don't get into the weeds about how these [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=220.38s)]
*  commissions are paid. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=221.82s)]
*  But for real estate agents, for realtors, this is how they make their living. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=222.82s)]
*  This is very important. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=226.14s)]
*  It's literally their bread and butter. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=227.14s)]
*  And this settlement was meant to shake up the system of how those commissions are determined [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=228.78s)]
*  and how they're paid. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=233.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=234.26s)]
*  No longer were they simply tablets handed down from God on the mountain. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=235.26s)]
*  In the real estate industry, they were subject potentially to negotiation, conversation, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=239.74s)]
*  and potentially they could go way, way down, maybe even go away. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=246.14s)]
*  We are wandering the desert now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=248.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=249.9s)]
*  Most importantly, it was meant to say, this is the way it's been done for a long time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=250.9s)]
*  The way it's been done has actually been anti-competitive. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=255.10000000000002s)]
*  It's blocked competition. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  Now it's changed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=259.18s)]
*  Now home sellers can say, I want to pay X, I want to pay Y. It's up to you how much commission [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  you want to pay. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  And that brings us back to our superlatives. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  Because if suddenly a 6% commission on a home sale might not be 6%, but might be 5 or 4 [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  or 3 or whatever, then suddenly home prices might change, might go down. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=275.46s)]
*  That is what economists predicted because commissions are actually baked into home sale [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=281.54s)]
*  prices. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  When you sit down with a realtor before you sell your home and there's all this paperwork [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=286.86s)]
*  and all this mumbo jumbo, one thing you generally do is you have a conversation. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=290.3s)]
*  This is how much commission you're going to pay me as your agent. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=294.66s)]
*  So as a result, we're going to set the price for the home here so that when that commission [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=296.9s)]
*  is paid out, you still take home as much as you want. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=300.82s)]
*  If commissions go down, if you're only paying 5%, a 1% reduction in home prices across the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=305.09999999999997s)]
*  board in the US is a massive dent in the housing market that actually really should open things [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=309.46s)]
*  up for a housing market that is so tight and so restrictive for so many buyers. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=314.5s)]
*  So we were really optimistic that it was going to change things. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=318.94s)]
*  So let's talk about the big and then moment in this story of why all this promised superlative [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=321.78s)]
*  change has not come to pass. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=329.98s)]
*  I call it the great real estate workaround. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=334.62s)]
*  Hmm, very intriguing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=337.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  Explain. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  The settlement was designed to take away these conversations that agents were having about [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  commissions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=344.34s)]
*  These conversations were happening over these channels, these databases, they're called [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=345.62s)]
*  MLSs, multiple listing sites. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=349.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=350.62s)]
*  These are online portals used by real estate agents to basically list a house. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=351.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  It's where home listings live on the internet. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=356.53999999999996s)]
*  And if you're an agent and you're working with a buyer and you're looking for houses, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=359.06s)]
*  you go to the MLS to see what houses are for sale. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=361.9s)]
*  And each listing has information on it, the address, the square feet, et cetera. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=364.26s)]
*  It also used to have a commission amount. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=368.02s)]
*  This is probably the place where we need to remind everyone that commissions tend to be [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=370.62s)]
*  split right between the agent for the buyer and the agent for the seller. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=375.26s)]
*  Yes, almost universally. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=382.5s)]
*  Even though it comes out of the seller's pocket. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=384.38s)]
*  The seller pays the commission to their agent and that agent for the sellers then splits [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=386.58s)]
*  that commission with the buyer's agent. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=391.98s)]
*  That's how it has been done for a long time. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=394.82s)]
*  And MLS just kind of laid it all out. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=398.5s)]
*  And the key focus of the settlement was that should be no more. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=399.5s)]
*  Moving forward, post-settlement, the rules said that sellers pay their own agents, buyers [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=403.58000000000004s)]
*  pay their own agents. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=408.48s)]
*  If you work with a real estate agent, it's up to you to pay them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=409.76s)]
*  That was what was supposed to happen, which should have brought a lot more competition [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=413.08000000000004s)]
*  and negotiation into the marketplace. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=416.32s)]
*  Workaround could work around that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=418.42s)]
*  Well, the settlement was very specific in its language. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=421.02s)]
*  That these conversations about splitting commissions could not happen on these databases. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=423.82s)]
*  So the real estate community was like, okay, we'll just move these conversations elsewhere. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=427.68s)]
*  It never said we can't have them at all. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=432.82s)]
*  And I don't mean this is happening in secret. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=438.86s)]
*  Hello, my name is Kevin Sears and I am the 2024 president of the National Association [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=441.1s)]
*  of Realtors. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=445.74s)]
*  Today, I'd like to touch on a couple of things. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=446.74s)]
*  Just a few days after the settlement. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=449.82s)]
*  Now in the settlement, there are a couple of key pieces. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=451.94s)]
*  One is financial, the other is rules. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=454.3s)]
*  Now let's talk about the rules. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  The president of NAR made a video that went out to every realtor in the group. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=459.09999999999997s)]
*  Please hear me clearly. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  You will still be able to offer compensation to a buyer broker. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=465.78s)]
*  It just cannot be conveyed on the MOS. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=471.21999999999997s)]
*  That said, to move these conversations. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=474.18s)]
*  If there's one thing I know about members, they will figure out how to efficiently communicate [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=476.94s)]
*  the information to see if there will be any cooperating compensation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=481.34s)]
*  That video was backed up by NAR's head of legal, who has doubled down on the idea that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=485.82s)]
*  in the settlement, the language says these conversations are banned only on the MLS. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=491.14s)]
*  So just know that we are doing everything we can to continue to advocate for your ability [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=497.46s)]
*  to help buyers, sellers, tenants and landlords all across our great country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=502.98s)]
*  So where exactly do these conversations move to once the premier trade group of the realtor [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=514.1s)]
*  world says to them, go be creative and find a new place to have these conversations? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=521.82s)]
*  Michael, it's gotten a little bit wild. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=525.86s)]
*  I spent the past year following this very closely, talking to agents, talking to industry [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=528.22s)]
*  Remember, the 6% was split 50-50. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=533.1s)]
*  So usually the seller and the buyer's agent would each get 3%. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=536.1s)]
*  I've heard stories of agents who in listing photos are putting three cookies on the kitchen [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=539.86s)]
*  table as a sign to a buyer's agent. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=544.14s)]
*  If you bring a buyer, you'll get 3%, which means they'll get their 3% also. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=547.1s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=551.3s)]
*  That's quite nefariously creative. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=552.3s)]
*  It's one way to put it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=555.22s)]
*  I've heard other stories of agents who've put movies on the TV screen in the living [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=556.22s)]
*  room during a showing of the house. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=560.58s)]
*  During a showing or even in the listing photo, there's a movie playing, but it's a movie [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=562.6999999999999s)]
*  that has three in the title, like The Three Amigos. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=565.5799999999999s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=569.26s)]
*  A real kind of open winking of defiance. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=570.26s)]
*  Yeah, some of them are much more old fashioned. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=574.2199999999999s)]
*  We're talking emails, phone calls, texts. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=577.26s)]
*  Some of them are really tech savvy. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=579.5799999999999s)]
*  There's one agent in Virginia. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=581.2199999999999s)]
*  She's an influencer on TikTok. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=582.8599999999999s)]
*  I'm just Liz and I sell real estate in Charlottesville and Richmond, Virginia. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=584.5799999999999s)]
*  And this is the way we're going to do it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=588.6199999999999s)]
*  She just said, okay, you can't go on the MLS. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=590.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure someone's going to have another way, but I'm going to build a landing page. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=591.98s)]
*  And she's created a landing page that other agents can use. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=595.26s)]
*  Easy peasy for every one of my listings. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=599.1s)]
*  And on that landing page is going to be all the information that any buyer's agent would [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=601.1800000000001s)]
*  need to know so I can easily just poof, text it to them. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  Here you go. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=607.78s)]
*  It enters all the homes they have for sale into their separate non-MLS site, compiles [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=609.54s)]
*  their data, and includes the commission. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=614.86s)]
*  So this is pretty open and creative and perhaps legal flouting of this ruling and settlement. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=616.98s)]
*  How much, Deborah, do you think that this represents real estate agents thinking to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=624.14s)]
*  themselves, look, this is how we get paid. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=630.14s)]
*  Our work is important to the process. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=634.74s)]
*  We are essential. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=636.88s)]
*  And many people will tell you that they're, especially on the seller side, broker, work [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=639.46s)]
*  their tush off, increase the value of their home. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=643.5s)]
*  Maybe not everyone. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=646.1s)]
*  There is data that says that people who use real estate agents tend to get a higher price. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=647.1s)]
*  There it is. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=650.74s)]
*  There could be confounding variables to that data. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=651.74s)]
*  Those people could have more money, could have higher priced homes. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=653.5s)]
*  There's all sorts of things. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=655.94s)]
*  But yes, there is a lot of data to back it up. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=656.94s)]
*  So isn't this the equivalent of agents creatively fighting to keep the equivalent of a waiter's [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=659.26s)]
*  15% tip? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=666.34s)]
*  It's like it's what they need to live. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=667.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=669.78s)]
*  And it's important to understand this is not happening organically. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=670.78s)]
*  In many, many ways, real estate agents are just doing what they've been told by the National [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=673.2s)]
*  Association of Realtors to survive in an industry that is cutthroat. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=677.2s)]
*  Again, we're talking more agents than listings. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=680.44s)]
*  There are not enough houses to go around. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  And agents do not work for companies. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  They're independent contractors. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=687.0600000000001s)]
*  They pay their own taxes. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=688.0600000000001s)]
*  They split their commissions with their brokerages. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=689.1600000000001s)]
*  For the people on the ground, this really is a life or death moment for their career. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=691.12s)]
*  So they feel we're being told we should have the conversations elsewhere. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=695.5200000000001s)]
*  And so they are. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=698.82s)]
*  Why would they not? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=699.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=700.82s)]
*  It's their job. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=701.82s)]
*  And so if there was a real estate team that argued the settlement, they would say, sharing [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=703.44s)]
*  is caring, unless we're talking about real estate commissions and then sharing is collusion. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=705.94s)]
*  And the real losers are home sellers because the settlement was supposed to drive down [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  prices. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=714.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=715.98s)]
*  So how effective have the great workarounds that you're describing here been in preventing [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=716.98s)]
*  the reforms and reductions in price that we thought this settlement was going to usher [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=722.82s)]
*  in? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=728.3800000000001s)]
*  Well, the data shows that these workarounds have been very effective at preventing the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=729.38s)]
*  reforms. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  There have been a handful of studies in the real estate industry looking at how commissions [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=733.9399999999999s)]
*  may or may not have moved. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=737.62s)]
*  The data is problematic because most of them are being carried out by people in the real [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=739.22s)]
*  estate industry. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=743.42s)]
*  So they have a vested interest in the data that makes the data less than reliable for [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=744.42s)]
*  reporting processes. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=747.9399999999999s)]
*  But one study by one real estate media company showed that in the months after the settlement [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=749.86s)]
*  half a percentage point across the board, which is a lot of money. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=756.34s)]
*  It's not this watershed that we thought was going to happen, but it's something. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=759.4200000000001s)]
*  Two other studies, one was carried out by Redfin, which is also a brokerage, and one [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=762.86s)]
*  was carried out by a real estate accounting technology company. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=766.62s)]
*  So they have a vested interest in this data. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=769.38s)]
*  State commissions haven't moved at all. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=771.38s)]
*  So the American home seller is not getting any relief at a time when they desperately [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=773.38s)]
*  need it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=776.7s)]
*  So we can use that data, but we don't want to rely on it because of the conflict of interests. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=777.7s)]
*  What is more telling are the conversations I've had reporting on this for the past year. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=782.92s)]
*  I've talked to dozens and dozens of home sellers and buyers. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=787.28s)]
*  The ones interacting most directly with the commissions. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=790.36s)]
*  So this is anecdotal data, but there's a lot of it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=792.5999999999999s)]
*  And they are all telling me that not only are there workarounds, they're more aggressive [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=794.9s)]
*  than ever and they're more frustrating than ever. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=799.0s)]
*  Some sellers are so frustrated that they're saying, I'm just going to go it alone. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=801.18s)]
*  I'm going to sell my house on my own and cut realtors totally out of the equation. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=804.4399999999999s)]
*  Find a workaround around the workaround. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=808.1999999999999s)]
*  A workaround around the workaround around the workaround. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  But you know, Michael, you used a biblical reference earlier about Mount Sinai. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=812.24s)]
*  I'm going to use another one. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=816.36s)]
*  We're really in a David versus Goliath sort of situation where you have these individual [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=819.36s)]
*  sellers who want to sell their very valuable asset and an entire industry of realtors who [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=822.88s)]
*  are very committed to maintaining the status quo, mobilizing together to fight them every [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=829.66s)]
*  step of the way and make it extremely difficult to work around the system. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=836.1800000000001s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=845.0200000000001s)]
*  So Deborah, tell us about some of the sellers who tried to go it alone because they're so [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=852.1800000000001s)]
*  frustrated with the world of realtors, with the commissions and the status quo and about [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=857.1600000000001s)]
*  the resistance that, as you said just before the break, they encounter when they try to [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=862.98s)]
*  do that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=868.0600000000001s)]
*  Michael, let me tell you about one of them. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=869.0600000000001s)]
*  Day two of trying to sell my house without an agent in one of the most rigged real estate [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=871.78s)]
*  markets in the country. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=874.9s)]
*  His name is Mike Chambers. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=876.4200000000001s)]
*  He's a home seller in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=877.62s)]
*  They try to make this impossible, but I have a plan. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=879.86s)]
*  And I first became aware of him because a source sent me a video on Instagram that Mike [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=883.4200000000001s)]
*  had made. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=887.14s)]
*  All right, let's clear something up because from the first video, I think a lot of people [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=888.14s)]
*  assume I think realtors are useless. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=890.5s)]
*  And the truth is, I don't. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=892.1s)]
*  But I do think that most drastically overvalue their services. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=893.3800000000001s)]
*  And in Colorado specifically, they kind of operate like a cartel. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=896.2600000000001s)]
*  So here's my take. He created a handle called Realtors Hate Me, and he was chronicling the [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=899.58s)]
*  process of selling his house himself without an agent. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=904.5400000000001s)]
*  Are you OK if I record our call? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=907.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's fine. OK, that's so. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=909.6600000000001s)]
*  So I called him to find out what was going on. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=912.6600000000001s)]
*  And he told me his story. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=914.6600000000001s)]
*  Mike is a former professional athlete and entrepreneur. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=916.0600000000001s)]
*  Like I have no background in this whatsoever. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=919.3000000000001s)]
*  I've been thrown into this, honestly. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=922.38s)]
*  I didn't really think too much about the real estate industry until about four weeks ago [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=925.94s)]
*  when I decided that I wanted to list my house myself. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=930.1s)]
*  And Mike has a really nice house. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=933.26s)]
*  You know, I've got a great house. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=935.34s)]
*  It's turnkey. It's a desirable location and desirable city. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=937.3000000000001s)]
*  It's worth probably about two point seven five million dollars. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=941.5s)]
*  A really, really nice house. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=944.0600000000001s)]
*  Really nice house. Turnkey renovated. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=946.02s)]
*  I spent the past couple of months having some conversations with local agents regarding [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=948.0200000000001s)]
*  potentially listing my home. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=953.74s)]
*  He decided to put it on the market. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=955.22s)]
*  He interviewed a handful of real estate agents. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=956.46s)]
*  And in those conversations, I asked the questions that I would have any sort of service [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=958.5s)]
*  provider that I would be interviewing to get a sense of like how they were going to [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=964.7s)]
*  provide value. He knew about the settlement. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=968.1s)]
*  He had read the reporting. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=970.38s)]
*  He knew that things were supposed to be different. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=971.86s)]
*  Now there was supposed to be room for negotiation. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=974.0200000000001s)]
*  You know, I couldn't find an agent who was willing to go below two and a half percent [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=976.34s)]
*  to list my house. Every single seller who came to his home said, I'm not willing to [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=980.54s)]
*  negotiate and wanted him to pay at least five percent commission. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=985.3s)]
*  It's going to be one hundred and forty thousand. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=988.62s)]
*  Right. On a two point seven five million dollar house, that's over one hundred [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=990.38s)]
*  thousand dollars. Oftentimes it equates to about ten to thirty hours worth of work. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=993.9s)]
*  Exactly. For many people in this country, that's a salary for a year they can only [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=998.62s)]
*  dream of achieving. And he could not figure out what the agents were going to do that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1002.38s)]
*  was worth one hundred thousand dollars. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1007.5s)]
*  Because like you said, this house is ready to sell. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  It's pristine. So in his mind, it doesn't need the kind of attention, the kind of [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1011.14s)]
*  love, the kind of investment that a seller's agent can bring when a house is in [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1015.38s)]
*  rougher shape, when it needs work. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1020.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1022.58s)]
*  It was a lot of money. Everyone was like, well, you're being cheap. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1024.14s)]
*  Like it's such an expensive house. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1026.98s)]
*  I'm like, it's my money. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1028.26s)]
*  Like, I've worked hard to build this equity in this house and I don't want to just give it away. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1029.18s)]
*  I want to pay someone for their services, of course, but I don't want to just just light it on fire [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1034.38s)]
*  just because there's a system that's forcing me to. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1040.26s)]
*  It seems kind of crazy. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1042.6200000000001s)]
*  And a lot of real estate agents obviously would disagree with this. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1044.98s)]
*  But from Mike's opinion, this is his asset. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1047.1000000000001s)]
*  He did not want to put forth one hundred thousand dollars or more of the sale price to an agent. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1049.9s)]
*  But nobody was willing to negotiate. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1054.54s)]
*  So, anyhow, it all just felt weird. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1056.3s)]
*  I just didn't like it. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1058.14s)]
*  I was frustrated with it and really just had this epiphany like I was a marketer. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1059.06s)]
*  That's my background. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1064.22s)]
*  So I felt confident in my ability to market the home. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1066.74s)]
*  So he said to himself, how hard can it be? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1069.1399999999999s)]
*  So I just decided to go for it. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1071.86s)]
*  I'm going to do it myself. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1074.22s)]
*  And he began not just selling his house on his own, but chronicling the whole thing online for [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1076.62s)]
*  viewers and building a following as he did it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1081.22s)]
*  OK. And what happens once Mike decides to go it on his own based on all these frustrations with [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1083.22s)]
*  realtors in Boulder? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1090.4199999999998s)]
*  He starts running into roadblocks. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1091.98s)]
*  He learns very quickly that the industry has made it much harder than he thought to sell his house. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1094.1799999999998s)]
*  First of all, he knows that if he wants a buyer to come, he needs to offer commission to the buyer. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1099.26s)]
*  He was willing to. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1104.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to slow this down to make sure I understand. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1105.26s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1106.98s)]
*  He knows he's going to have to offer some percentage commission to the buyer's agent. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1107.6200000000001s)]
*  He himself is his own agent. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1114.14s)]
*  So he's the seller's agent that's taken care of. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1115.9s)]
*  It's almost like he's in court representing himself. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1119.5s)]
*  OK. So he knows if I want buyers to come, I should probably be willing to pay the buyer's agent [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1121.58s)]
*  commission. So he's already winning in a sense because the commission he's paying is probably going [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1126.46s)]
*  to be what? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1130.94s)]
*  Around half of what he would normally pay if he had to pay both the buyer and the seller's agent. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1131.7s)]
*  Exactly. So he's willing to pay that commission and he wants to get the house listed on the MLS so people [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1137.58s)]
*  can find it. Now, if you're not working with an agent, how do you list a house on the MLS? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1142.58s)]
*  I don't know. He Googles it. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1147.18s)]
*  He figures this out. There's companies that do this for you. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1148.3400000000001s)]
*  But he lives in Colorado and he quickly learns that in Colorado there are laws that say if I'm going to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1151.14s)]
*  list the house on the MLS, I have to also do a bunch of other stuff and you have to pay me all this stuff. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1156.06s)]
*  It's a rule designed by realtors to make it too hard to get your house listed on the MLS. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1160.54s)]
*  That was the tipping point for me where I was like, this is a mess. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1164.54s)]
*  This whole system is a mess. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1168.5s)]
*  Then he realizes he wants to get his house listed on Zillow. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1170.5s)]
*  Everybody uses Zillow and Redfin to search for houses. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1173.38s)]
*  In listing my house on Zillow, I learned that even Zillow has its own safeguards to push people to work [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1176.22s)]
*  with brokers. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1182.94s)]
*  And he learns that Zillow actually has a program that homes that are sold for sale by owner, not with [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1184.18s)]
*  agents, are actually harder to find than homes that are listed by agents. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1190.14s)]
*  So the agents strike back again. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1193.9s)]
*  So basically in real time for all these people following him on Instagram, he's discovering all these [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1195.94s)]
*  layers of the real estate industry that he didn't know existed. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1202.0200000000002s)]
*  So here I am, I take it on MLS. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1205.22s)]
*  Zillow is sort of stonewalling me. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1207.7s)]
*  So he gets the home on the market. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1209.74s)]
*  He stages it. He takes photos. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1211.1000000000001s)]
*  It's ready to go. Buyers, agents in Boulder know about his house. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1212.5800000000002s)]
*  Obviously, like these videos are starting to go viral and there's starting to be a conversation locally [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1216.66s)]
*  about my story in particular. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1221.8600000000001s)]
*  And I start to like hear some weird stuff. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1224.26s)]
*  And one day, one of them gives him a call and says, something's happening that you need to know about. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1231.0600000000002s)]
*  Agents representing buyers at my company are talking to each other in text and in person, saying, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1236.9s)]
*  we're not going to sell this guy's house because he's not playing by the rules. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1243.18s)]
*  So agents who might represent potential buyers who would love to have a two point seven million dollar [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1246.34s)]
*  turnkey house in Boulder are saying we are not going to take our potential buyers to this house. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1252.22s)]
*  We're going to boycott it. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1258.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a word for this in real estate. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1260.1000000000001s)]
*  It's called steering. You're either steering buyers towards a certain home or away from a certain home. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1261.38s)]
*  And you're not allowed to do it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1266.14s)]
*  But it happens all the time. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1267.38s)]
*  And what would be the explanation that these agents would have for steering people away from Mike's house? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1268.42s)]
*  There's no hypothetical. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1275.78s)]
*  They gave the explanation in text messages that I saw when I was reporting. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1276.74s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1279.58s)]
*  They told this other agent who wanted to bring buyers, why would you take buyers to a house with a seller who's [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1279.98s)]
*  working against the system, who's undermining the way things have been done? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1286.22s)]
*  It was a boycott. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1290.62s)]
*  So what ends up happening to Mike and to his house? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1292.6999999999998s)]
*  So Mike does find a buyer. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1296.6599999999999s)]
*  There's a couple in Florida who sees the house on Zillow. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1297.82s)]
*  They make an offer. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1300.58s)]
*  He actually offers to pay a commission to the agent who's representing them. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1301.7s)]
*  But in the end, he actually pulled out of the sale because Mike decided after seeing so much of the inside [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1305.74s)]
*  workings of the real estate industry that he wants to start a business to try to fix it. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1311.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1315.26s)]
*  So rather than moving his family to Costa Rica, which was his dream, he's now going to stay in Colorado for the [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1315.58s)]
*  time being and work on this startup company that he's created to try to change real estate commissions. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1320.22s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1325.22s)]
*  And he told me about how it's not that he's trying to take down the real estate industry. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1326.06s)]
*  I do think there's a critical role for real estate agents in the world. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1330.1s)]
*  And I think this has never been my issue. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1333.06s)]
*  He believes that real estate agents are very important and sometimes are really useful. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1335.9399999999998s)]
*  Just allow me to act in my own best interests. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1340.78s)]
*  And through this experience so far, it's felt like quite the opposite. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1344.4599999999998s)]
*  His message, though, which has been echoed by many other people I've spoken to in my reporting, is that you [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1350.34s)]
*  should be able to determine how much you want to pay for that service. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1358.06s)]
*  And the industry gets on allowing those conversations to come to the surface. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1361.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1365.5s)]
*  Great to meet you. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1366.4199999999998s)]
*  Bye. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1367.4199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1369.86s)]
*  Because everything you found and he found is that one way or another, agents are still operating to a real [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1370.1s)]
*  degree in the shadows as they try to ensure that the commission structure that is supposed to be [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1377.34s)]
*  negotiable is actually not all that negotiable. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1385.26s)]
*  If you talk to economists and analysts in the industry, they will say the settlement was a massive breakthrough [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1390.14s)]
*  moment. If you talk to agents, many of them will say the settlement changed nothing. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1395.5s)]
*  There is a huge gap in understanding. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1399.98s)]
*  And in the middle are agents on the ground just trying to make money and home sellers and buyers just trying to [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1402.3s)]
*  navigate the process. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1406.74s)]
*  There's no clear communication here about how it's supposed to work. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1408.6200000000001s)]
*  So surely the government regulators know what you know. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1411.14s)]
*  Maybe that's asking too much. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1416.46s)]
*  Well, they read us. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1417.7800000000002s)]
*  They do. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1419.1000000000001s)]
*  They know what you know based on your reporting and they would seem to have a real interest in enforcing the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1419.26s)]
*  original settlement in as broad a way as possible. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1425.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  So is that happening? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1428.94s)]
*  Is there an effort underway to clarify some of this confusion that you are still seeing out there? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1430.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1437.74s)]
*  And no. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1438.74s)]
*  The Justice Department has been investigating the National Association of Realtors for years. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1440.1000000000001s)]
*  There's been a back and forth with them for a very long time. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1444.42s)]
*  The settlement was brought by private home sellers. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1447.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1450.06s)]
*  It wasn't a government lawsuit. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1450.22s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1451.38s)]
*  But the DOJ was absolutely investigating NAR and they continue to investigate NAR. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1451.9s)]
*  Commissions and the conversations about commissions are a huge piece of that investigation. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1457.82s)]
*  But the Justice Department has a lot of other things on their plate right now. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1462.66s)]
*  The government is very busy and working with many fewer staff than they used to. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1466.5s)]
*  So it's really anyone's guess how high of a priority this is and if there is going to be further [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1471.06s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1476.42s)]
*  Is there an appetite for it? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1477.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1478.8200000000002s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1479.18s)]
*  Understood. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1480.06s)]
*  I think it makes sense to end here with a little bit of news that you can use, which isn't exactly the space we [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1480.9s)]
*  normally occupy. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1487.3s)]
*  But I'm just going to assume that somewhere in the universe of daily listeners are folks who are thinking of [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1488.18s)]
*  buying or selling their home or perhaps are in the process of buying or selling a home and could benefit from the [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1495.34s)]
*  journalistic wisdom that you have accumulated over the past year or so reporting on this. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1501.82s)]
*  So what would you say to people who are trying to figure this out? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1509.34s)]
*  Perhaps aren't willing to do what Mike did, which is actually take charge of the whole process [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1513.8999999999999s)]
*  themselves, but they just want to be able to navigate the current dynamic in the best way possible. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1519.18s)]
*  If I've learned anything in the last year from reporting on this, it's that buying and selling a home is really scary and really [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1525.94s)]
*  overwhelming to the vast majority of people. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1531.22s)]
*  Mike is an anomaly because he decided to just go with his own and kind of figure it out as he was going along. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1533.5400000000002s)]
*  For most of us, it's really scary. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1538.22s)]
*  I've sold a home. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1540.22s)]
*  I remember sitting down with my agent. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1541.18s)]
*  I had no idea what the stack of papers was in front of me and we just agreed to whatever she said because we trusted her. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1543.22s)]
*  You, a real estate reporter, didn't ask about the commission. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1548.9399999999998s)]
*  I did not ask about the commission. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1552.1s)]
*  I'm willing to say that to you, Michael, to your face. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1553.2199999999998s)]
*  I did not ask about the commission. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1555.4199999999998s)]
*  I think we paid 6%. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1556.6599999999999s)]
*  I honestly don't remember. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1558.1399999999999s)]
*  If it happened to me, it can definitely happen to anyone who's listening to this. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1559.58s)]
*  It is not a problem to pay 6% as long as you know what you've agreed to. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1562.82s)]
*  Which probably means asking. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1566.3799999999999s)]
*  My number one piece of advice is to understand even if you're told you cannot negotiate on commissions, you can negotiate on [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1568.1799999999998s)]
*  commissions. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1574.94s)]
*  And if the agent doesn't want to, you have the right to go find another agent. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1575.42s)]
*  You also absolutely have the right to know what you are paying for and to ask the questions. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1579.5800000000002s)]
*  Okay, you're going to charge me this much money. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1584.74s)]
*  What are you doing for that money? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1586.5s)]
*  Just like you would with any other transaction. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1588.1000000000001s)]
*  It's my understanding based on everything I have read that this legal settlement has only officially been in place, I think, for a [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1590.7s)]
*  little bit less than a year. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1600.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1602.46s)]
*  Since August of last year. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1602.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1603.7800000000002s)]
*  So I wonder if there's a case to be made that as successful as all these workarounds have been, that it's still very early days. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1604.22s)]
*  And that over time, the system could change to better benefit the consumer as they become more aware of guidance like what you're [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1615.3400000000001s)]
*  talking about here and of the new realities and rules that are now in place. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1625.5s)]
*  Or if you think that the more time goes by, the more power that realtors and the realty industry will accumulate. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1630.8200000000002s)]
*  Michael, I asked this question to the lawyer who brought the case that resulted in the settlement and won it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1641.14s)]
*  His name is Michael Ketchmar. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1645.94s)]
*  And what he said to me was pretty interesting. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1647.7s)]
*  He said, you know, Blockbuster video when movies started streaming. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1650.3400000000001s)]
*  Now you're really taking us back. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1653.38s)]
*  Yes, I am back to the 90s. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1654.78s)]
*  But Blockbuster did not shut down all of its stores the minute things started streaming. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1656.22s)]
*  It took time. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1659.86s)]
*  Right. VHS didn't just go the way of the dodo overnight. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1660.86s)]
*  It probably took what? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1663.6599999999999s)]
*  10, 15, 20 years. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1664.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1666.3s)]
*  It was a great transformation, just like he believed this will be a great transformation too. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1666.7s)]
*  But these things do not happen overnight. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1672.98s)]

*  but they said it did not appear to be an act of deliberate sabotage like a cyber attack. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpuD0I0ta-Q&t=1788.6599999999999s)]
