# How Strong (or Not) Is New York’s Case Against Trump?
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=4.24s)]
*  In the week since Donald Trump was arraigned on 34 felony charges. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=18.44s)]
*  The debate about whether the case against him is either weak or strong has only intensified. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=28.96s)]
*  The indictment is insufficient on its face. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  It was just a bunch of papers that were stapled together. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  These facts are not that squishy to me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=43.64s)]
*  This seems like a straightforward business records fraud case. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=46.44s)]
*  I think this is even weaker than I feared it would be. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=50.28s)]
*  You've got tapes, you've got records, you've got a recipe for a very strong case. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=53.08s)]
*  This is crap that a pre-law student shouldn't even put in front of a damn judge. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=58.32s)]
*  Today, my colleague Charlie Savage has been closely studying the case to understand which [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=62.84s)]
*  side is right. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=70.04s)]
*  It's Wednesday, April 12th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=81.84s)]
*  Charlie, when Donald Trump was indicted last week, we were very eager to finally get a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=89.32s)]
*  look inside this case that the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been building. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=94.27999999999999s)]
*  Because we always had a pretty good sense that he was going after Trump for falsifying [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  business records. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  That was kind of the base of the case, which is a set of misdemeanors. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  But we knew that Bragg would need to prove a second crime in order to make those charges [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=110.88s)]
*  turn into felonies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=117.04s)]
*  And then the indictment comes down and we don't get an answer to what that second crime [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=118.88s)]
*  is going to be. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=123.68s)]
*  We still don't have an answer to that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=124.96s)]
*  And that's why it feels like there's such a lively debate playing out about whether [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=126.24s)]
*  this case is strong or whether it's weak. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=130.44s)]
*  And that's where you come in because you are very smart about legal questions and prosecutions. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=133.72s)]
*  So with all that in mind, where should we start? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=140.08s)]
*  Well, let's start by breaking this down. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=143.44s)]
*  As you just mentioned, normally bookkeeping fraud, falsifying business records under New [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=145.92s)]
*  York penal law is a misdemeanor. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  To make it into a felony, that crime had to be committed with the intention of concealing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=154.6s)]
*  or committing some second crime. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=161.44s)]
*  And so the question hovering over all this for weeks leading up to the unsealing of this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  indictment has been what is that second crime? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=169.92s)]
*  What is Alvin Bragg's theory of the case to turn a trivial misdemeanor case to a serious [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=172.92s)]
*  felony case that he can still bring? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=178.92s)]
*  And so the unveiling of the indictment and the statement of facts when Trump was arraigned [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  was our first opportunity to really see what is his theory of the case. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  And there was new insight in there and some things that had not been talked about before. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  And at the same time, it was maddening. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=199.72s)]
*  It was infuriating because he still was not clear about it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=201.84s)]
*  There's nowhere in here where he says this becomes a felony because X or this becomes [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=206.24s)]
*  a felony because Y. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=211.12s)]
*  So we have to infer what he's getting at, both from the statement of facts that accompanied [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=212.2s)]
*  the indictment and from statements in the courtroom and his press conference. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=218.2s)]
*  But before we infer too much, what should we make of the fact, Charlie, that the district [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=223.08s)]
*  attorney has chosen not to tell us what he thinks the second crime is or which potential [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=227.48s)]
*  second crime he's likely to pursue? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=234.28s)]
*  Well, when he was asked, why don't you just tell us at his press conference afterwards, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=236.48s)]
*  he said, well, the law doesn't require me to at this stage. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=241.28s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=244.56s)]
*  It is possible there is some strategic advantage to this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=245.56s)]
*  It's possible that this is some kind of trial balloon situation where he's throwing out [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=249.64s)]
*  concepts and wants to see, because there are some novelties surrounding this case, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=254.68s)]
*  what do law professors and former prosecutors and talking heads on TV say about it? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  And there's some kind of hive minding that will help him refine his own theory or what [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=264.12s)]
*  appears to be actually maybe multiple alternate theories put forward. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=270.08s)]
*  But that's just my speculation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=275.24s)]
*  I feel like he ought to have told us I would have liked to have known on Tuesday. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=276.52s)]
*  Do it for us, district attorney. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=282.44s)]
*  For me, really, isn't that what's important satisfying my curiosity? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=284.24s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=288.08s)]
*  So in the meantime, that leaves us still trying to figure out what the second crime will be. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=289.44s)]
*  And you had mentioned that the indictment did reveal a few new insights into what Bragg [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=295.54s)]
*  is up to. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  So let's talk about what we think based on everything we now know about what the second [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  crime is like this to be and how strong or how weak that second crime might end up being [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=307.48s)]
*  legally speaking. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=314.38000000000005s)]
*  So in general, it looks like there's going to be two broad categories of crime that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  he'll be pointing to or gesturing at. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=322.54s)]
*  And as a preliminary matter, he doesn't have to prove that the second crime occurred. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  He only has to prove that Trump intended for a second crime to be concealed or advanced [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=329.34000000000003s)]
*  when he caused the Trump Organization's business records to be fraudulently entered. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=336.18s)]
*  And it looks like there's two broad categories of things he's going to gesture at. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=341.98s)]
*  One is campaign finance crimes, and the other is intended false statements to tax authorities. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  So let's start, Charlie, with campaign finance. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=351.8s)]
*  How easy or how hard do we think it will be for Bragg to make that the second crime? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=354.34000000000003s)]
*  So to back into that, we need to quickly remember what we're talking about here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=361.82s)]
*  So this takes us back to the 2016 campaign, the final month. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=366.8s)]
*  A porn star, Stormy Daniels, has come to the Trump world and said, I'm going to talk about [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=370.36s)]
*  this extramarital affair your candidate had with me shortly after his current wife gave [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=376.08s)]
*  birth to his son. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=381.66s)]
*  And Michael Cohen, Trump's fixer and lawyer, sends her $130,000 October 2016 to keep her [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=383.68s)]
*  quiet through the end of the election. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  This raises a question. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=394.28s)]
*  Was that a campaign finance expenditure intended to affect the election, keep this information [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  from voters? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  Was that a personal life expenditure intended to keep this information from Melania Trump [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=402.34s)]
*  and from Barron Trump, his son, inherently murky? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  In 2017, Trump reimburses Michael Cohen for that money. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  So if, and this is the thing Alvin Brad would need to prove as part of all this, if he can [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=415.32s)]
*  convince a jury that that was a campaign expenditure, then those financial transactions were regulated [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  or should have been regulated by campaign finance law. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=427.47999999999996s)]
*  And that means that Michael Cohen made an unlawfully large contribution to the 2016 [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=431.52s)]
*  Trump campaign. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=437.64s)]
*  Individuals can't give $130,000 to someone else's campaign. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=438.64s)]
*  And in 2017, when Trump reimburses him, he should have reported that publicly on his [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=443.28s)]
*  FEC campaign spending filings, which he did not. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=448.8s)]
*  So a lot of that turns on was that in fact a campaign expenditure or a personal life [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=453.2s)]
*  one? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  An inherently ambiguous question. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's talk about why that's ambiguous. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, if a hush money payment is made weeks before a presidential election, it seems intuitive [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=461.88s)]
*  if I'm a DA or a juror that it's connected to that election. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=471.36s)]
*  The prospect of having an affair like that come out right before an election seems like [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=476.84s)]
*  it would be very, very embarrassing and exactly the reason to pay someone off. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=482.88s)]
*  So what makes that so difficult to prove? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  So the strong part about it is the timing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=490.2s)]
*  Apparently Daniels had tried to get money before and was rebuffed. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=492.64s)]
*  And so suddenly now it's October, then we're a couple of weeks from the election and there's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  There was an uproar over the famous Access Hollywood tape. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=501.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  Trump brags about groping women. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  Question is whether evangelical Christian types in particular are going to abandon him. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  Maybe this porn star's accusation of an extramarital affair would just destroy the campaign. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  And suddenly she gets paid when before she did not. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=517.92s)]
*  That would be what the prosecution would say to the jury. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=520.28s)]
*  This was obviously about the campaign. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=522.6s)]
*  But the defense team can say, no, because of the campaign, this was going to get more [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=524.72s)]
*  attention. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=528.96s)]
*  But what he really wanted to do was avoid personal embarrassment. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=529.96s)]
*  He didn't want his wife to find out. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  He didn't want his son to find out. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=534.6s)]
*  He says it's not true anyway, but it was this gross and he just wanted it to go away. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=537.08s)]
*  And you know, is there proof beyond reasonable doubt that the motivation was A versus B? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=541.6s)]
*  Looking at it from the outside, it could be both, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=546.48s)]
*  It could be both at the same time. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=548.9200000000001s)]
*  And so there's something messy about campaign era payments to a mistress that is not as [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=551.0s)]
*  black and white as most of what we'd like to see in a courtroom. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=558.64s)]
*  Right, because you're saying in order for this to become the second crime that makes [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=561.64s)]
*  this all a felony, the DA is going to have to prove it's related to the campaign. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=566.64s)]
*  But I'm also hearing you say, if I'm reading between the lines, that unless there's really [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  hard evidence of making this up, but a recording where Trump says to Michael Cohen, make this [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=574.86s)]
*  go away, I'm worried about evangelical voters in the election happening in two weeks, then [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=579.6s)]
*  it's going to be hard to get inside his head and know whether the president was more concerned [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  about the personal dimension of this or more concerned about the political side of it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=590.6800000000001s)]
*  If campaign finance crimes are the second crime that turns bookkeeping fraud into a [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=596.0400000000001s)]
*  felony, then yes, they will need to show that. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=601.64s)]
*  And that's why Daniels' earlier efforts to get money and being rebuffed for her testimony [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  would be important to that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=611.6s)]
*  The testimony of Michael Cohen and what his conversations are with Trump surrounding that [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=613.12s)]
*  payment and then the reimbursements will be important to that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=618.96s)]
*  Was this a conversation about elections or was this a conversation about a wife? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=622.12s)]
*  Things that would show Trump's motivation. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=627.32s)]
*  That's the sort of evidence that a prosecutor would need to put forward to show this was [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=630.36s)]
*  done because of an election and not because of a personal life or not solely because of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  personal life. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=639.36s)]
*  Charlie, I recall that Michael Cohen was convicted of his role in this same hush money payment [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=640.4s)]
*  scheme we're talking about and that campaign finance was one of the reasons why. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=646.36s)]
*  And I wonder if we should interpret that as increasing the odds that the district attorney [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=652.6s)]
*  is likely to get Trump on a similar campaign finance charge that would make this all a [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=657.72s)]
*  felony. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=663.88s)]
*  Two people, both involved in the same scheme, one's already gone to jail over this, kind [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=664.88s)]
*  of makes sense that the DA would see that as strong evidence that it's likely to work [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=669.24s)]
*  against Trump as well. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=674.48s)]
*  If you talk to campaign finance law experts who are skeptical of this theory that Bragg [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=676.52s)]
*  seems to be playing with, they are also skeptical of that conviction of Cohen. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=682.2s)]
*  And the reason for that is that prosecutors were bringing a variety of charges against [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=689.04s)]
*  Cohen, most of which had nothing to do with this. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=694.6s)]
*  It was other sorts of financial crimes. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=697.2s)]
*  And he was pleading guilty. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=700.12s)]
*  He was not going to trial. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=702.08s)]
*  He was not fighting those charges. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=703.08s)]
*  So they throw in this campaign finance one and he agrees to plead guilty to it as part [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=704.84s)]
*  of this negotiated package. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=709.08s)]
*  And so that means it was never really tested in court. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=711.82s)]
*  You never had someone standing up to a jury and saying, no, no, no, this was about his [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=715.36s)]
*  wife. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=719.48s)]
*  This was about his kid. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=720.48s)]
*  He didn't want them to hear about it. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=721.48s)]
*  Doesn't that introduce reasonable doubt to you, Mr. and Mrs. Jures? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=722.48s)]
*  And so it superficially looks like it's been established, but maybe not. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=726.24s)]
*  That's their point of view on that charge. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=730.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=732.04s)]
*  It hasn't been truly tested in an adversarial prosecution defense environment. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=733.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=737.52s)]
*  OK. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=738.52s)]
*  So we should understand the campaign finance second crime scenario as one that on paper [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=739.52s)]
*  looks like it might be easy to prove. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=747.28s)]
*  There's a lot of circumstantial evidence. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=749.08s)]
*  But in reality, in the courtroom, it seems like it could actually be a bit of a challenge. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=750.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=756.44s)]
*  And remember, there was a very famous case that's kind of like this that was brought [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=757.44s)]
*  against John Edwards, former Democratic senator and 2008 presidential aspirant, involving [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=761.08s)]
*  money paid to a woman that he had not just had an affair with, but who had had his child. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=767.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=772.64s)]
*  And whether that was a campaign finance crime to sort of pay her living expenses and keep [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=773.64s)]
*  her quiet while he was still seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2008. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=777.5600000000001s)]
*  And when that case went to trial, he was acquitted on one charge and the jury hung on the rest. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=784.04s)]
*  And then prosecutors decided not to try again. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=790.28s)]
*  And so that case was a little different in some details. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=793.68s)]
*  Payments to her kept happening after he had withdrawn from the race. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=797.52s)]
*  And that was one reason it was even murkier. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=800.76s)]
*  But it does illustrate this is not an easy charge to bring campaign finance charges related [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=803.32s)]
*  to money to a mistress. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=809.0s)]
*  It's just a sticky situation. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=812.12s)]
*  And there's another wrinkle here. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=814.28s)]
*  And what is that? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=816.6s)]
*  And that has to do with federal law and state law. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=817.6s)]
*  Remember, this is a state criminal case. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=821.48s)]
*  This is a state prosecutor charging violations of a state law against bookkeeping fraud. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=824.52s)]
*  But federal law, right, generally is what regulates presidential elections. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=831.76s)]
*  And so to the extent he's looking towards campaign finance as that second crime that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=838.16s)]
*  turns this state misdemeanor into a state felony, is he going to invoke a federal crime, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=843.36s)]
*  a federal law? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=850.04s)]
*  Can a state prosecutor do that? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=851.36s)]
*  Was this written to encompass laws that are not felonies in New York but are felonies [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=853.16s)]
*  in some other system of government? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=858.16s)]
*  It's an untested issue. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=860.4399999999999s)]
*  So these are things that have given people anxiety about the strength of his case, about [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=863.0s)]
*  its novelty, about the risk of the theories that Bragg seems to be relying on as he puts [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=868.88s)]
*  it forward. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=874.64s)]
*  But there was new information that came out last week suggesting that Bragg might be bolstering [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=876.48s)]
*  his case with another potentially stronger theory of the second crime. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=882.56s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=893.0s)]
*  So, Charlie, the first category in this basket of potential second crimes, campaign finance, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=898.28s)]
*  clearly is precarious. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=907.56s)]
*  So let's turn to the second one. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=909.52s)]
*  What is it? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=913.0s)]
*  The second category of potential crime that could elevate bookkeeping fraud from a misdemeanor [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=914.0s)]
*  to a felony has nothing to do with campaign finance. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=920.48s)]
*  It has to do with taxes and lying to tax authorities. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=923.56s)]
*  This was not something that had received a lot of attention leading up to the unsealing [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=928.68s)]
*  of the arraignment. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=933.68s)]
*  And even on the day of the unsealing last Tuesday, you had to sort of do a dumpster [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  dive through the statement of facts, through the comments made on the side in the press [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=940.26s)]
*  conference and in the courtroom to see that the seeds were being planted to say that even [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=946.7199999999999s)]
*  if you don't buy this campaign finance thing, dear jury, there's this whole other category [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=952.8399999999999s)]
*  of potential crime that could still get you across the line. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=959.04s)]
*  So to recall the elements of this, not only did Michael Cohen wire this $130,000 to Stormy [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=963.4399999999999s)]
*  Daniels in October of 2016, but he was reimbursed by the Trump Organization over the course [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=971.76s)]
*  of 2017. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=977.04s)]
*  And in its records, Trump Organization said that was for legal services that he was performing [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=979.24s)]
*  in 2017 pursuant to a retainer. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=986.1999999999999s)]
*  And we know from the case that there was no retainer. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=989.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=992.56s)]
*  It was a lie. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=993.56s)]
*  It was a lie. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=994.56s)]
*  And it was not for legal services performed in 2017. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=995.56s)]
*  It was to reimburse him for this payment he had made out of his own pocket in 2016. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=997.76s)]
*  And on top of that, it wasn't just reimbursing him $130,000. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1002.2s)]
*  It was reimbursing him basically twice that because he was going to, it appears, report [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1005.76s)]
*  this stream of money arriving every month into his bank account from the Trump Organization [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1011.24s)]
*  as if it were income for some service that he had something he had earned in 2017, which [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1017.08s)]
*  means he was going to have to pay taxes on it. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1022.24s)]
*  And so according to prosecutors to make him whole so that he ends up with $130,000 at [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1024.48s)]
*  the end of all this, they had to pay him more, essentially laundering the stream of money. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1029.64s)]
*  So it looks like one thing, even though it was another thing. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1034.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1038.4s)]
*  Which is basically tax fraud, because what you're describing is the misrepresentation [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1039.4s)]
*  of payments as taxable income. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1044.04s)]
*  And so suddenly the second crime that we're now contemplating is lying to the government, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1047.1200000000001s)]
*  lying to the local tax authority, New York State. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1054.0s)]
*  Well, it could be both federal and state tax authorities, right? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1057.1999999999998s)]
*  There's because there's you file taxes to both. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1061.6s)]
*  And we don't know, again, what Bragg's theory and evidence is here. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1064.24s)]
*  We don't know if the Trump Organization issued a 1099 non-employment compensation form for [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1067.86s)]
*  payments to Cohen in 2017. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1074.48s)]
*  And if so, what it said. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1076.28s)]
*  But it's also worth thinking about one more complexity, because this isn't complex enough. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1078.32s)]
*  We need more complexity about this, because you said actually two different crimes just [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1082.08s)]
*  now, Michael. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1086.08s)]
*  You said tax fraud. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1087.08s)]
*  And then at another point, you said lying to tax authorities. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1088.52s)]
*  These aren't the same thing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1091.62s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1092.84s)]
*  Tax fraud is paying less taxes usually than you actually owe. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1093.84s)]
*  Whereas lying to tax authorities is a subset of the crime of giving false information to [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1098.04s)]
*  the government. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1103.36s)]
*  And when it comes to tax fraud, this is a kind of funny situation, if you think about [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1104.36s)]
*  it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1108.04s)]
*  Under reporting his income so that he has a smaller tax bill and therefore cheating [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1109.52s)]
*  the government of New York out of some of the tax revenue to which it's rightfully entitled, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1114.2s)]
*  he's over reporting his income. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1119.2s)]
*  And so New York is ending up with more tax income than it otherwise would have if everything [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1121.0s)]
*  was on the up enough. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  But separately, whatever the weirdness of that, it is a crime in New York law to submit [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1127.68s)]
*  false information to the state government. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1133.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1136.0s)]
*  So I have to say this looks like it would be an easy and definitely easier second crime [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1137.0s)]
*  than campaign finance to establish for Alvin Bragg, the DA, based on the fact that when [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1141.6s)]
*  you report things to tax authorities, it creates a pretty significant paper trail. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1148.08s)]
*  So am I right in thinking that this would be a relatively easy thing to pursue? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1151.88s)]
*  Or is it actually secretly hard like everything else in this case? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1158.32s)]
*  Well I would certainly say easier. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1161.88s)]
*  Easier. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1164.16s)]
*  And while it seems to sidestep some of the complex issues with the campaign finance route, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1165.16s)]
*  we still don't know what evidence Bragg has. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1170.2s)]
*  We don't actually know if there's a paper trail. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1172.48s)]
*  We don't know how he might try to convince a jury that Trump was intending at the time [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1174.88s)]
*  of the bookkeeping fraud to deceive tax authorities. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1179.0400000000002s)]
*  But remember that Alvin Bragg doesn't apparently have to just put forward one theory. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1182.68s)]
*  Oh, the crime was this. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1189.64s)]
*  Oh, the crime was that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1191.2s)]
*  As it was explained to me by former assistant district attorney's conversant in New York [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1193.04s)]
*  law, he can give alternate theories to the jury simultaneously. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1197.84s)]
*  Maybe it was this. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1204.44s)]
*  Maybe it was that. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1206.2s)]
*  Maybe it was federal campaign finance. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1207.2s)]
*  Maybe it was state campaign finance. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1208.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe it was an intention to deceive federal or state tax authorities. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1210.26s)]
*  In fact, he'll probably say it's all of the above. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1215.48s)]
*  All the above redundantly get us across the finish line to this being felony rather than [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1219.2s)]
*  misdemeanor. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1224.2800000000002s)]
*  And as long as the jury, the jurors are individually convinced by any one of those, they can vote [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1225.2800000000002s)]
*  to convict as a felony. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1234.18s)]
*  Oh, that's really interesting. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  You're raising the possibility that of the 12 jurors, I'm making this up, but five might [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1236.88s)]
*  think that it was a campaign finance violation that gets this all to be a felony and seven [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1244.68s)]
*  might think it was a tax issue. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1249.9s)]
*  And as long as they think that this is a felony and they vote that way, that's fine. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1251.88s)]
*  They don't all, in theory, have to even agree. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1257.3200000000002s)]
*  I think you're putting your finger, Michael, on something that's very interesting and complicated [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1259.96s)]
*  about this. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1263.76s)]
*  If it's right that Bragg is moving towards putting forward an array of alternative theories [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1264.76s)]
*  and saying he believes all of them, but the jury just needs to believe one. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1271.4s)]
*  And again, we're in this maddening situation where he hasn't said what he thinks the second [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1275.72s)]
*  crime is or what crimes plural were, since that seems to be where he's headed. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1280.1200000000001s)]
*  So we're trying to infer from the outside. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1286.9s)]
*  When he has to turn over a bill of particulars, assuming Trump's legal defense team asks for [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1289.38s)]
*  one in discovery, he'll have to say this more explicitly and then at that point, we should [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1294.44s)]
*  understand this better. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1300.02s)]
*  But it certainly raises the possibility that different jurors might have different theories [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1301.8600000000001s)]
*  of the case in their own heads. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1307.1s)]
*  Charlie, it very much feels to me like this concept of throwing multiple second crime [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1309.02s)]
*  felony charges against the wall and seeing what might stick. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1317.82s)]
*  That idea has invited a lot of the debate that we have watched played out over the past [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1321.98s)]
*  week or so about the strength of this case. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1328.06s)]
*  We hear many people saying this case feels flimsy or weak. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1331.82s)]
*  And there are people on the other side who disagree and say it's stronger. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1336.82s)]
*  But am I right to understand that Alvin Bragg's decision not to articulate one second crime [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1339.96s)]
*  that he wants to pursue clearly as being a big contributor to this debate about whether [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1349.1799999999998s)]
*  this is fundamentally just not that strong a case? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1356.74s)]
*  Michael, I think that's right. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1360.74s)]
*  And yet at the same time, there's a chicken and egg issue here, which is if he had a singular [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1362.98s)]
*  knockout second crime, he wouldn't need to throw things against the wall, multiple things [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1370.8600000000001s)]
*  against the wall to see what sticks. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1375.66s)]
*  The most natural second crime here is a campaign finance crime that he knows is going to attract [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1377.48s)]
*  accusations of novelty or problematic legally untested overtones. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1384.22s)]
*  And that is leading him down this path of there's this and there's this and there's this. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1390.0200000000002s)]
*  There's so many things here, folks. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1395.22s)]
*  Got it. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1397.18s)]
*  The most natural case is potentially weak. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1398.18s)]
*  So he wants a safety net. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1401.14s)]
*  He wants kind of a legal parachute, which is how you go from just campaign finance to [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1402.14s)]
*  campaign finance plus potentially taxes, which sounds a little bit like something of a [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1406.66s)]
*  risky strategy when you're taking on a former president of the United States, the kind of [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1414.02s)]
*  all the above spaghetti approach. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1418.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, that's one way of looking at it. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1419.98s)]
*  Another is it's built in suspenders, right? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1421.82s)]
*  If one fails, the other is there, vice versa. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1424.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1426.74s)]
*  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1427.74s)]
*  So Charlie, what happens if Alvin Bragg can't prove one of these second crimes and he ends [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1429.62s)]
*  up being left with basically a bunch of misdemeanors? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1439.54s)]
*  Because we talk about these 34 charges as felony charges, but they're not felonies until [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1443.34s)]
*  they're made into felonies by the second crime. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1447.6599999999999s)]
*  So if you don't get the second crime, what does that look like? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1449.46s)]
*  Well, that creates two possibilities, neither of which are great for Bragg. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1452.94s)]
*  It will come down to what the judge's instructions to the jury are at the trial. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1458.46s)]
*  Either the prosecution or the defense team could ask the judge to instruct the jury that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1464.1s)]
*  it has the option of finding Trump guilty of misdemeanor bookkeeping fraud because the [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1470.34s)]
*  elements of that are included in the felony charges that Bragg actually charged him with. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1477.02s)]
*  Or they could choose not to ask the judge to let the jury know that it has that option. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1484.1s)]
*  And then it would be all or nothing. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1490.5s)]
*  Find Trump guilty of felonies or acquit him. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1492.6599999999999s)]
*  At this stage in the case, we do not know which of those two paths will be taken. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1496.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1501.94s)]
*  So what you're really saying is without the second crime, Bragg is either left with a [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1502.94s)]
*  bunch of misdemeanors, which is not really that impressive a case, or he's potentially [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1509.66s)]
*  left with nothing at all. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1516.98s)]
*  So in a way, this second crime, establishing it, being able to make that case to the jury, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1519.8600000000001s)]
*  really does feel like the whole ballgame. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1526.1399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1528.94s)]
*  And without it, it would be a complete collapse for the district attorney and a huge vindication [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1531.78s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1537.04s)]
*  And that would be why people are nervous about of all the investigations against Trump, this [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1538.62s)]
*  one going first. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1545.02s)]
*  Well, Charlie, thank you for explaining all this. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1547.02s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1550.62s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1552.26s)]
*  On Tuesday, district attorney Alvin Bragg filed a federal lawsuit designed to defend [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1556.54s)]
*  his case against one of its fiercest critics, Republican Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1562.6599999999999s)]
*  The lawsuit seeks to block Jordan and his Republican allies in Congress from trying [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1569.5s)]
*  to obtain confidential materials compiled during Bragg's investigation of Donald Trump. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1575.1s)]
*  In the lawsuit, Bragg described that effort as a quote, brazen and unconstitutional attack [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1582.0s)]
*  against the office of the district attorney and an effort to interfere with his indictment [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1589.48s)]
*  against Trump. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1595.84s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1601.0s)]
*  Here's what else you need to another day. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1602.0s)]
*  This awful act of violence at Old National yesterday has taken another life. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1613.08s)]
*  Late yesterday, we learned that Deanna Eckert passed. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1619.32s)]
*  She was 57 years old. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1622.56s)]
*  As the death toll from Monday's mass shooting in Louisville, Kentucky rose to five, police [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1626.2s)]
*  said that the suspected gunman used an AR-15 rifle that he had legally purchased just six [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1631.8400000000001s)]
*  days before the attack. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1638.64s)]
*  During a news conference, local elected officials said that under current gun laws, they simply [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgXp9BbJ0WI&t=1641.0s)]
