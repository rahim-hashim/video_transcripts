# The University President Willing to Fight Trump
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. This is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=0.0s)]
*  Over the past few weeks, some of the most prestigious universities in the country have [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=13.88s)]
*  faced a threat to their very existence from President Trump, who has frozen billions of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  dollars in federal funds in an attempt to rid higher education of what he calls its [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=22.84s)]
*  woke ideology. And the question now is, who will cut a deal and who will fight? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=27.74s)]
*  Today, my conversation with the President of Princeton University, Christopher Icegrouper, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=35.739999999999995s)]
*  who has vowed that he will fight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=41.66s)]
*  It's Wednesday, April 9th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=47.66s)]
*  Hi, I'm Christopher Icegrouper. Hi, Rachel Abrams. Thanks for coming here. Yes, thank you for making the time for us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  You mind if I grab a cup of coffee? Please, no, no. You should definitely caffeinate. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  Okay. I'm already caffeinated, so I need to super caffeinate if I'm touched up. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=66.66s)]
*  No, good. We like that energy on The Daily. We're a high-energy show. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=72.66s)]
*  All right. Okay. Come on back. Terrific. Thank you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=77.66s)]
*  So, President Icegrouper, first of all, Icegrouper, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=84.66s)]
*  Yeah. Feel free to call me Chris, please. It's easier than Icegrouper. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=87.58s)]
*  Chris, we are talking to you about one week after the administration moved to suspend [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=90.58s)]
*  dozens of grants to Princeton, and that could be hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=95.58s)]
*  And this, of course, follows the moves from the administration against other universities. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=101.58s)]
*  We've seen it with Columbia. We've seen it with Harvard. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=106.58s)]
*  And if this goes the same way that it's gone for other institutions, what we could expect [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=109.58s)]
*  to see in the near future, if you haven't gotten it already, is a list of demands from the Trump [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=115.5s)]
*  administration, changes that they want to see from Princeton. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=119.5s)]
*  So we want to talk to you today about how you're feeling about the choices that you have [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=123.5s)]
*  in front of you and what those choices even look like, practically speaking. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=129.5s)]
*  But just to start off, I want to start this conversation with you maybe taking us back to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=133.5s)]
*  the moment when, if you remember, when you realized that Princeton might actually be in trouble. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=140.42s)]
*  Well, without trying to be precise right now about the timeline, we began to see precipitous [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=144.42s)]
*  kind of threats to funding streams early on in the new presidential administration. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=152.42s)]
*  And that included initially a freeze to research funding to universities. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  It included the imposition of severe caps on what are known as facilities and administration [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=165.33999999999997s)]
*  recoveries or overhead cost charges. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=171.33999999999997s)]
*  Those are charges that apply to very real costs of research. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  And suddenly the government is saying, well, we're going to take that number down in ways [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=177.33999999999997s)]
*  that are going to make it impossible for universities to go forward with the research that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  they've been doing before. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=185.33999999999997s)]
*  So that was the point at which I and every other university president realized there [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=187.33999999999997s)]
*  was a serious threat to this government university partnership that has contributed to the strength [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=192.26s)]
*  of the country and to the quality of our research institutions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=198.26s)]
*  Then a couple of weeks ago, something happened at Columbia that introduced a new and in my [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=202.26s)]
*  view, very dangerous element to this, which is that the government came in and without [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=208.26s)]
*  any due process or any apparent investigation said basically to Columbia, we're going to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=213.26s)]
*  take away a bunch of your grants that support things like medical research and we're not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=219.17999999999998s)]
*  going to restore them to you unless you do things like admissions reform for how it is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=223.17999999999998s)]
*  you take in undergraduate students and putting certain departments that deal with things [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=227.17999999999998s)]
*  like Middle Eastern studies into receivership. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=231.17999999999998s)]
*  That was whole new territory in terms of what the government was doing because the government [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=234.17999999999998s)]
*  was using its tremendous power over research dollars to try to control what a private university [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=239.18s)]
*  was doing in terms of matters that are generally considered part of academic freedom. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=247.1s)]
*  That is how you constitute your departments, how you choose your students and presumably [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=251.1s)]
*  how it is you choose your faculty. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=255.1s)]
*  Of course, with Columbia, what the Trump administration said was that its motivation for pulling [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=257.1s)]
*  Columbia's funding was this failure to root out anti-Semitism on campus. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=262.1s)]
*  But in your mind, was that the motivation? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=268.1s)]
*  Did that ring true to you? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=271.1s)]
*  What did you understand that action by the administration to truly be about with regards [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=274.02000000000004s)]
*  to Columbia? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=279.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, Rachel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  So let's start with this, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=281.02000000000004s)]
*  Standing against anti-Semitism is a fundamental responsibility for any university president [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  and for any university. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  It's something where universities ought to be working in partnership with the government. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  And if the government has concerns about anti-Semitism or any other form of hate on a college campus, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  it is legitimate for the government to go in. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  And so, it's pursuant to the laws that exist prohibiting that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=301.94s)]
*  Title IX, for example. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=303.94s)]
*  Title IX, Title VI, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=304.94s)]
*  And to come in to require the university to take steps. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=305.94s)]
*  But that's the right way to proceed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=310.94s)]
*  In that kind of investigation, as in any other kind of investigation, the government should [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=312.94s)]
*  be observing the due process that our law provides. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=318.94s)]
*  They should be allowing universities to respond and offer their side of the story. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=321.94s)]
*  And then they should be putting in place, if they find that there are violations, appropriate [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=328.86s)]
*  remedies that are tailored to the violations and to the law. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=331.86s)]
*  I think the problem with what happened at Columbia was that due process was not observed. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=335.86s)]
*  The threats were made to funding without any real investigation or without any opportunity [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=340.86s)]
*  for Columbia to respond. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=346.86s)]
*  And then they were done in ways that encroached on these extraordinarily important principles [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=349.86s)]
*  of academic freedom. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=354.86s)]
*  From my own standpoint, as I look at Columbia, I would say it's clear there were some serious [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=356.78000000000003s)]
*  problems with anti-Semitism on that campus. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  I also believe it's clear that Columbia was taking steps that they should be taking in [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=363.78000000000003s)]
*  order to address anti-Semitism. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  If the government didn't think they were doing enough, that's a perfectly appropriate thing [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=370.78000000000003s)]
*  for the government to be involved in. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  But again, respecting the norms of due process that are fundamental to our law and fundamental [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  to our country, rather than doing this in some way that just comes in and says, hey, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=382.7s)]
*  we're taking your funds and now we want you to make these other kinds of changes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=386.7s)]
*  So basically, you're viewing all of this. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=389.7s)]
*  I'm just going to narrate a little bit for us here. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=391.7s)]
*  You are seeing what's happening at Columbia. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=394.7s)]
*  That's when you decide to write this op-ed in The Atlantic, right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=396.7s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=399.7s)]
*  And you said that what the Trump administration is doing right now basically amounts to, quote, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=400.7s)]
*  the greatest threat to American universities since the Red Scare of the 1950s. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=405.7s)]
*  Every American should be concerned. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=411.62s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit why did you decide to write that op-ed and what did you mean [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=413.62s)]
*  by that quote specifically? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=417.62s)]
*  So I decided to write the op-ed because I do think there's a very fundamental threat [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=419.62s)]
*  here right now with two dimensions to it, to America's research universities that anybody [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=424.62s)]
*  who cares about the strength of this country, our economy, our prosperity, our security, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=430.62s)]
*  our health should be worried about. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=434.62s)]
*  The threat to this compact between the government and our universities that has produced research [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=437.54s)]
*  that's made a difference in the life of every American. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=442.54s)]
*  The reason I wrote when I did, when the threats were made to Columbia, is that there's an [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=445.54s)]
*  even more fundamental threat when the government starts intruding on academic freedom. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=450.54s)]
*  It basically says there are departments at Columbia that seem to be saying things that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=454.54s)]
*  we don't like. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=458.54s)]
*  We're going to use this funding as a mechanism to try to change what it is Columbia is doing [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=459.54s)]
*  in that respect. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=464.54s)]
*  That means as we look at efforts to influence what universities are doing, how they teach [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=467.46000000000004s)]
*  about Israel and Gaza, how they teach about climate, how they teach about American history, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=471.46000000000004s)]
*  how they teach about diversity, we are seeing threats of significant intrusion into the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=477.46000000000004s)]
*  freedom of scholars to raise the kinds of ideas that enable change to take place in [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  our society and enable people to pursue truth. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=490.46000000000004s)]
*  We see another version of this going on as the government goes in and gives an order, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=494.38s)]
*  for example, to the United States Naval Academy to remove a whole series of books from its [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=498.38s)]
*  library. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=503.38s)]
*  There is a pattern here of intrusions in academic freedom of strong universities that should [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=504.38s)]
*  be of concern to every American. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=509.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=512.38s)]
*  Basically, to say this another way, the administration may have said that these actions that they're [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=513.38s)]
*  taking are about anti-Semitism and rooting that out on campus, but it sounds like what [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=516.38s)]
*  you are saying and your point of view is that this is more about this broader beef the Trump [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=521.3s)]
*  administration has with institutions of higher education, specifically with regards to academic [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=526.3s)]
*  freedom, the things that they are teaching and not teaching, and that the government, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=531.3s)]
*  it sounds like, again, correct me if I'm wrong here, but the government has this enormous [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=535.3s)]
*  leverage, which is research funding, and that is the cudgel with which that they can punish [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=539.3s)]
*  universities for speech or actions or conduct or academics that they do not like. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=544.3s)]
*  So, I just sort of wonder, would you agree with that, that this is more about academic [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=550.2199999999999s)]
*  freedom than maybe some of the other reasons that we have heard recently? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=554.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=559.2199999999999s)]
*  Rachel, I don't want to make this about motive and what the government's motive or intentions [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=560.2199999999999s)]
*  are. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=564.2199999999999s)]
*  What I would say is, if this is genuinely about anti-Semitism, there's a right way [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=565.2199999999999s)]
*  to go about that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=571.2199999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=572.2199999999999s)]
*  We should want our universities and our government to be partnering around making sure we have [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=573.2199999999999s)]
*  campuses where everybody can flourish, and for me, that's about all the groups on my [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=580.14s)]
*  campus. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=583.14s)]
*  It's about our underrepresented minorities. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=584.14s)]
*  It's about our Jewish students. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=585.74s)]
*  It's about our Muslim students, and we should all be working together around that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=587.1s)]
*  But there are right ways to do that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  The wrong way of doing it does involve using funds as a cudgel to get universities to do [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=593.3000000000001s)]
*  things that the government wants. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=599.94s)]
*  And when, for example, I'll take one particular demand in the government's letter to Colombia. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=601.46s)]
*  I asked Colombia to do comprehensive admission reform. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=608.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=610.06s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=611.06s)]
*  I don't know what that means, Rachel, but what I do know is that I can't draw a connection [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=612.06s)]
*  between the stated concern of remedying anti-Semitism and a suggestion that Colombia should do comprehensive [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=617.9s)]
*  admission reform. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=625.8199999999999s)]
*  You think these things are disconnected? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=626.8199999999999s)]
*  I think they're disconnected, and in any event, I think that it's not appropriate for the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=627.8199999999999s)]
*  be using its power as a funder to change the way that Colombia does its research, its teaching, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=633.7399999999999s)]
*  or its admissions. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=639.42s)]
*  So okay, I hear what you're saying that academic institutions should be free to decide what [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  to teach, when to teach, how to teach, who to admit, all of that stuff, while also maintaining [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=646.5799999999999s)]
*  their obligations to have a safe and equitable environment for students. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=650.3599999999999s)]
*  I hear all of that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=654.2199999999999s)]
*  And you wrote a little bit about this in the op-ed. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=656.18s)]
*  To play devil's advocate for a moment, universities have made themselves over the last few decades [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=658.78s)]
*  incredibly dependent on government funding and public money, and that has made them vulnerable [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=663.6999999999999s)]
*  because it has given the federal government essentially this one enormous donor incredible [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=669.3399999999999s)]
*  leverage over universities. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=674.42s)]
*  And maybe they haven't dictated up until now what you should teach, but everybody knows [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=676.06s)]
*  that universities are beholden to their donors and that donors have influence. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=680.5s)]
*  That's why people donate buildings. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=683.18s)]
*  And so I just want to understand, first of all, how reliant Princeton is on federal funding, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=685.34s)]
*  what it's used for, and whether in retrospect was it a mistake to build an ecosystem of [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=691.4200000000001s)]
*  higher education and learning that was so reliant on essentially a single donor? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=698.7s)]
*  So let me say a few things about that. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=704.1s)]
*  One is just that I think universities have a responsibility no matter where funding is [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=707.1800000000001s)]
*  whether it's from a private donor or from the government to ensure that in taking the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=712.7s)]
*  funding, they don't accept any strings that are inconsistent with academic freedom. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=717.7s)]
*  And certainly for me as a president, it means that we have to look carefully any time we [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=722.7s)]
*  take a gift and there are gifts we turn down because we think that they would interfere [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=727.0200000000001s)]
*  with academic freedom if we took them. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=730.6600000000001s)]
*  Second thing you asked is how much funding we take as a research university per year [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=733.0600000000001s)]
*  from the federal government, which is again going to be our biggest sponsor. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=738.42s)]
*  For us, it's around, you know, ballpark in the neighborhood of $250 million a year on our main [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=742.18s)]
*  campus. I say main campus because there is also a plasma physics laboratory, which is a [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=749.34s)]
*  Department of Energy National Laboratory that we operate for the government. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=754.9399999999999s)]
*  That's a government laboratory off campus. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=759.1s)]
*  And so that gets you up to around 400 to 500 million if you count the laboratory, which is [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=761.86s)]
*  in total that's about 17, 18 percent of Princeton's overall operating budget for the year. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=767.14s)]
*  So it's not inconsistent. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=771.94s)]
*  I'll trust your math on that, Rachel. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=772.34s)]
*  Yes, it's significant. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=773.74s)]
*  And it would be higher at many of our peer institutions because most of our peers, for example, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=775.5400000000001s)]
*  have medical schools. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=780.34s)]
*  And if you have a medical school given the size of its budget and it's dependent on national [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=781.78s)]
*  institutes of health funding, the percentages are going to be higher. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=785.82s)]
*  The other question you asked is whether or not it's a mistake to accept that funding given the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=791.4200000000001s)]
*  dependence that it creates. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=796.62s)]
*  Rachel, I would say the answer to that is no. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=798.0600000000001s)]
*  This is this funding has been present in the United States for a period of 70 years at all [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=799.86s)]
*  of our leading research universities. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=807.26s)]
*  And it has allowed our research universities to be able to conduct research that makes a [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=809.42s)]
*  difference to the world, that makes our country stronger and that we could not conduct even at [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=813.82s)]
*  a place like Princeton with its endowment resources if we were not accepting funding from the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=820.02s)]
*  federal government. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=825.94s)]
*  And that becomes even more true as you look all the way across the country. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=826.74s)]
*  So when you ask about things like, you know, why does the United States win so many more [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=830.6600000000001s)]
*  Nobel prizes than other places? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=834.98s)]
*  Why is it that we have the set of discoveries here that over time lead to things like the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=837.7s)]
*  Internet and artificial intelligence or GLP-1s or new immunological cancer treatments? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=843.1800000000001s)]
*  Those things are happening because of this partnership. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=848.74s)]
*  And there could be other models that you could have that would involve less government money [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=851.62s)]
*  flowing to universities. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=855.82s)]
*  You would also have less research benefiting the United States if you did that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=857.58s)]
*  Well, can we just... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=861.3000000000001s)]
*  I was just thinking about that for a second because why couldn't you just be more dependent [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  on private sector money? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=866.62s)]
*  I mean, presumably the private sector would be just as interested in all of the research [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=867.62s)]
*  that you just described. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=872.1800000000001s)]
*  So couldn't you build a model where there's private sector funding? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=873.48s)]
*  What is the pitch for universities to take government funding specifically? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=876.94s)]
*  Yeah, so when we are creating laboratories or buying equipment or doing other things, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=881.18s)]
*  paying for faculty, a lot of that funding is coming from what our donors have made possible. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  But you need another $250 million a year to be able to do the research that those faculty [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=892.6999999999999s)]
*  are doing. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=897.86s)]
*  Could you sub in private companies funding that? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=900.26s)]
*  I don't think so, right? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=902.3399999999999s)]
*  Partly because the time horizon on the research that the government funds is in general longer [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=903.62s)]
*  term than what companies are looking at. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=909.3s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=911.22s)]
*  They want to return on their investment. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=912.22s)]
*  They want to return on their investment. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=913.22s)]
*  That's the way that works. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=914.22s)]
*  And I mean, I'll give you a couple of these examples that involve National Science Foundation [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=915.22s)]
*  funding. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=919.26s)]
*  Our university has been fortunate in quantum science to host a couple of Nobel celebrations [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=920.62s)]
*  over the last decade, one of them for Duncan Halden and one of them for John Hopfield. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=925.84s)]
*  When Duncan accepted this prize, he's an Englishman, he came over to the United States and there [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=930.66s)]
*  were reporters from England interviewing him at the press conference. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=937.14s)]
*  They were interviewing him over Zoom. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=940.5s)]
*  And they asked this question, well, we're proud of you as an Englishman having won the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=942.94s)]
*  Nobel Prize. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=946.02s)]
*  How come you did it in Princeton, New Jersey, rather than back home in England? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=947.02s)]
*  And his answer was, I came to the United States because the National Science Foundation was [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=949.9s)]
*  willing to fund the kind of long term research that I do. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=954.58s)]
*  Whereas in England, the government funding agencies were looking at things with a much [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=959.94s)]
*  shorter term application. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=964.34s)]
*  If we stop that compact between the government and research universities, we're not going [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=966.78s)]
*  to be doing the kind of research anymore that Duncan Halden did. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=972.8399999999999s)]
*  And that research is either going to happen someplace else or it's not going to happen [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=976.74s)]
*  at all. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=980.26s)]
*  Given that the federal government contributes so much money to universities and that your [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=981.8s)]
*  point is that it's a unique relationship that the private sector cannot make up for. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=985.98s)]
*  If you suddenly took away $200 million, there isn't a private company waiting in the wings [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=990.66s)]
*  to fill that shortfall. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=993.98s)]
*  Given the fact that the government is now using the leverage that they have to force [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=995.94s)]
*  change on campus, I just want to take some of the government's arguments head on. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=999.4s)]
*  And specifically, as we mentioned before, the administration says what we're doing is [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1003.26s)]
*  in service of rooting out anti-Semitism on college campuses, particularly in the wake [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1007.66s)]
*  of the pro-Palestinian protests last year. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1011.98s)]
*  And you had mentioned earlier that you think that there is a problem. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1014.78s)]
*  You have recognized that anti-Semitism is a real problem on college campuses. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1019.26s)]
*  You suggested that maybe colleges are not doing enough to root it out and combat it. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1022.66s)]
*  And I would like to know specifically as a college president, as I think you mentioned [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1028.34s)]
*  in previous interviews that you yourself are Jewish and you feel a personal relationship [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1033.06s)]
*  to this issue. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1036.58s)]
*  I would like to understand and hear more about the specific things that you have seen in [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1037.58s)]
*  the past 18 months that are concerning to you and that have alarmed you. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1042.1s)]
*  Yeah, Rachel. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1045.86s)]
*  So I appreciate the question. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1046.86s)]
*  And I should say that there are two things that are true simultaneously. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1047.98s)]
*  One is I see things that alarm me about anti-Semitism. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1052.5s)]
*  The second is that many of our colleges are great places to be Jewish and better places [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1056.66s)]
*  to be Jewish than a lot of other parts of our society. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1061.74s)]
*  So I would say that about Princeton, our Jewish students report the highest levels of satisfaction [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1064.78s)]
*  and belonging on our campus. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1070.38s)]
*  And we look to support all of our students to make sure that they are having good experiences [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1073.02s)]
*  on this campus. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1076.74s)]
*  When you ask what alarms me on campuses… [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1077.74s)]
*  I'd like to know what specifically you've seen that has bothered you in the last 18 [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1080.6999999999998s)]
*  months. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1084.1s)]
*  So look, let me give you examples both from my own campus and off my own campus, right? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1085.1s)]
*  So on my own campus, I would say that both during my time as a student and a faculty [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1089.6999999999998s)]
*  member and then as president, I had never heard an anti-Semitic remark directed to someone [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1094.9399999999998s)]
*  else or to me until last year. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1098.98s)]
*  I did hear anti-Semitic remarks, including a couple that were directed my way over the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1101.78s)]
*  past year. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1106.46s)]
*  In person, somebody actually said something to you? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1107.46s)]
*  Somebody sent me something by email and there was another one that was left for me as a [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1109.54s)]
*  message. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1114.78s)]
*  I'll just put it that way. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1115.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1116.78s)]
*  Like a physical note. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1117.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1118.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1119.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1120.78s)]
*  So that's unacceptable, right? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1121.78s)]
*  That's unacceptable directed at any student. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1122.78s)]
*  Those are, in my view, marginal instances on our campus, but they're unacceptable instances. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1124.22s)]
*  If I look more broadly at what's going on, these are not things that we've experienced [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1130.8400000000001s)]
*  on Princeton's campus, but there are reports of students being physically harassed or targeted [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1135.22s)]
*  on campuses. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1139.74s)]
*  There are classes that have been interrupted. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1141.3600000000001s)]
*  There are students who have trouble getting to their classes. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1143.74s)]
*  There were remarks made by people, students, and academics in the wake of the October 7th [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1147.42s)]
*  Hamas terrorist attacks that were utterly unacceptable, right? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1153.9s)]
*  So there was one Cornell faculty member, for example, who described the event as exhilarating [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1157.78s)]
*  to him. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1163.38s)]
*  It's unacceptable and I don't see how you can say something like that without anti-Semitism [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1164.66s)]
*  being involved. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1170.0600000000002s)]
*  So those things disturb me and we need to make sure that there are processes on every [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1171.0600000000002s)]
*  campus to enable us to address those incidents. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1174.74s)]
*  You have to have very clear rules and you have to be willing to enforce them. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1178.3400000000001s)]
*  I want to bring up another one of the administration's critiques, which is something you hear a [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1181.46s)]
*  ton from the right and have heard it for a while, which is that universities, particularly [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1185.8600000000001s)]
*  elite universities like Princeton, Harvard, Yale, the Ivies, they are not representative [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1190.42s)]
*  enough of the broader public politically. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1195.0600000000002s)]
*  And of course, that's important because our judges, our lawyers, people that are incredibly [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1197.98s)]
*  influential in shaping society often come out of institutions like yours. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1203.0600000000002s)]
*  And so this is shaping not just how students think, but it is shaping American culture [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1206.8200000000002s)]
*  more broadly. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1210.3000000000002s)]
*  And that is why it is important to take a strong and aggressive stand. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1211.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm curious, what do you make of that argument, first of all? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1215.8200000000002s)]
*  And how important is it for a university to reflect the broader political ideologies of [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1220.1s)]
*  the country? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1227.22s)]
*  Is it a problem that most universities are probably left of center? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1229.02s)]
*  So, Rachel, there are a lot of different parts to that question you just asked. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1231.78s)]
*  Let me start with where I think the truth is in the critique, right? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1235.18s)]
*  So it is important for universities to have vigorous contestation about the truth and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1238.42s)]
*  to make it possible for people of diverse viewpoints to express their opinions and to [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1245.46s)]
*  flourish on the campus. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1251.1000000000001s)]
*  So we need to be a place where conservatives feel welcome. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1253.22s)]
*  We also need to be a place where conservatives feel they can speak up. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1256.5s)]
*  And we need to be a place where when there are important conservative arguments to be [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1260.3400000000001s)]
*  heard and when political viewpoints matter, people are asserting those. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1263.74s)]
*  And I do think universities can do better about that. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1268.2600000000002s)]
*  That is, when we're talking about free speech, we have to talk about the importance of having [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1271.9399999999998s)]
*  multiple viewpoints heard. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1275.9399999999998s)]
*  And we should care about that because it's integral to our own mission and what we're [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1278.34s)]
*  trying to do in education and research. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1281.82s)]
*  That's different from saying that universities should reflect the political ideology of the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1285.1s)]
*  country. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1289.6599999999999s)]
*  We shouldn't, actually, right? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1290.6599999999999s)]
*  We shouldn't. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1292.8999999999999s)]
*  It's not our job to reflect the political ideology of the country, right? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1293.8999999999999s)]
*  We're not a Sunday morning talk show that has ideological balance on it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1298.1s)]
*  We need to be open to conservative views. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1301.9399999999998s)]
*  We need to be a place where conservatives feel they can flourish. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1303.74s)]
*  But we're supposed to be doing something different than just reflecting what's going on in the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1307.36s)]
*  country. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1312.2199999999998s)]
*  We're supposed to be having arguments that get at truth and knowledge. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1313.2199999999998s)]
*  And that's different from a political debating society. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1316.9399999999998s)]
*  It's different from what goes on in Congress. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1319.34s)]
*  And it's different from what goes on in a lot of journalism or from the political distribution [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1322.1s)]
*  in the country. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1326.62s)]
*  There are political divisions about things like climate and vaccines right now. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1327.62s)]
*  And there is no obligation on the part of the universities to reflect what is the political [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1331.7399999999998s)]
*  division of opinion on those subjects or about, say, capitalism and investing. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1337.6599999999999s)]
*  I totally hear you that you don't want to platform ideas that you don't believe in, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1341.82s)]
*  such as bad science around climate change. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1345.54s)]
*  But I'm sure you can understand how conservatives might hear what you just said and think that [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1347.5s)]
*  their viewpoints are not necessarily as welcome as other viewpoints on campus. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1350.86s)]
*  Christopher Ruffo, I'm sure you're familiar with him. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1355.34s)]
*  He has been pushing a lot of the ideas that the administration is now using, it seems, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1357.44s)]
*  to make this broadside against higher education. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1361.1200000000001s)]
*  He's been arguing for years that universities are too quote unquote woke, that DEI is a [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1363.48s)]
*  problem. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1367.48s)]
*  He said something that I'm thinking of as you're talking right now. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1368.48s)]
*  He said, if conservatives want to protect the American way of life, they must be willing [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1370.56s)]
*  to lay siege to the institutions and reorient them according to their own values. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1374.04s)]
*  Clearly, people like Ruffo, and clearly he's got some powerful people who are listening [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1378.68s)]
*  that what you just articulated is not enough. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1384.84s)]
*  And that is the reason why the administration is taking such an aggressive approach. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1387.8s)]
*  And so I just wonder, like, do you need to rethink what you just told me, basically? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1391.6s)]
*  Now, Rachel, I think I need to insist on a distinction that I drew in what I just told [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1394.3999999999999s)]
*  you, which is that it's really important for conservative views to be welcome on a campus. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1398.84s)]
*  But that's different from insisting on ideological balance on a campus. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1404.48s)]
*  Our job is to have an honest, fair, truth-seeking process. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1409.58s)]
*  And an honest, fair, truth-seeking process will produce criticisms of society. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1414.3s)]
*  It won't just be a mirror to society. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1419.3799999999999s)]
*  So that's a difference. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1421.62s)]
*  There's a second thing you said in your original question that also connects to what it is [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1423.24s)]
*  that you just asked about Christopher Ruffo. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1426.8999999999999s)]
*  You quoted some accusations that universities indoctrinate. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1429.6s)]
*  Universities should never be indoctrinating, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1433.74s)]
*  I don't think we are. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1436.26s)]
*  And I don't think that the opinion data or the other serious studies of what universities [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1437.26s)]
*  do supports that. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1442.3s)]
*  We've got to be places where robust arguments take place. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1443.8600000000001s)]
*  I think what one has to understand is colleges and universities are going to be, I'm going [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1447.3400000000001s)]
*  to quote one of my predecessors in my office, Bill Bowen, they're going to be at a slight [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1454.3s)]
*  angle to society. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1457.82s)]
*  They operate pursuant to a different set of principles, scholarly disciplines that [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1460.36s)]
*  provide scholarly standards for how you judge arguments that are different from what exists [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1467.36s)]
*  in the rest of society. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1471.32s)]
*  So we shouldn't expect them just to be mirrors to what society is. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1473.4199999999998s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1484.4799999999998s)]
*  I want to go back to the storytelling for a moment and go back to Columbia, which capitulated [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1485.6s)]
*  pretty quickly to what the administration wanted. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1491.96s)]
*  And I want to get your reaction to that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1494.98s)]
*  But I also want to read you a quote that you gave, I believe it was to PBS when Columbia [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1497.76s)]
*  was sort of in the midst of all of this. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1503.28s)]
*  You said, once you make concessions once, it's hard not to make them again. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1504.82s)]
*  So I'd like to know, did what Columbia did make your job harder as you're now trying [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1510.96s)]
*  to figure out how to deal with the administration? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1517.16s)]
*  And are you talking to other university presidents to try to come up with some kind of a united [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1520.08s)]
*  front, much in the way that we're seeing some of the law firms that are under fire talking [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1526.28s)]
*  to each other to try to stand up for each other and present a united front? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1530.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1533.96s)]
*  So, you know, let me start with this, right, which is that the circumstances right now [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1534.96s)]
*  that face any university president are really tremendously difficult circumstances. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1539.94s)]
*  And I say that because I don't want to underestimate in any way the difficulty of the choices that [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1544.92s)]
*  my counterpart at Columbia faced. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1549.8600000000001s)]
*  I believe it's important and essential to stand up for academic freedom. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1553.7s)]
*  But the threats to an institution that are coming when the government says it's going [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1558.7s)]
*  institution of federal funding are severe in a way that present really hard choices. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1563.36s)]
*  Presidents are talking to one another about this. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1572.1999999999998s)]
*  I chair the board for the Association of American Universities. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1573.8799999999999s)]
*  Board meetings occur regularly. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1578.12s)]
*  Now that used to be twice a year, they're considerably more often. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1579.6399999999999s)]
*  What does regularly mean? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1582.08s)]
*  It's needed every one or two weeks or so. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1583.08s)]
*  Wow, because you're viewing this as a crisis. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1585.6399999999999s)]
*  It is a crisis, right? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1588.04s)]
*  I mean, the funding that is essential to the quality of American research and America's [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1589.72s)]
*  universities is under threat. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1594.12s)]
*  That's a crisis for universities and it is a crisis for our country. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1596.1599999999999s)]
*  We each have our own missions and our own needs. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1600.08s)]
*  So our responses are not necessarily going to be identical to one another. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1602.3999999999999s)]
*  But I will say this, I think even when universities have to concede or make concessions, because [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1608.58s)]
*  they may be forced to do that in order to protect people, I think they need to speak [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1613.6399999999999s)]
*  up under those circumstances and recognize the principles at stake, even if they say [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1617.68s)]
*  something like, I really regret this, but I need under these circumstances to make a [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1621.72s)]
*  compromise. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1625.88s)]
*  Do you wish you had heard that from Columbia? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1626.88s)]
*  I do wish I had heard that from Columbia, right? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1627.88s)]
*  I mean, I just think I understand why Columbia might feel that they had to make concessions [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1629.68s)]
*  under the circumstances. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1635.8400000000001s)]
*  These choices are so hard, right? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1637.0400000000002s)]
*  You have careers at stake, you have jobs at stake, you have the ability to educate your [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1638.3600000000001s)]
*  students at stake. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1643.0s)]
*  And you may say, look, I wish I could take a stand on principle, but given what's at [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1644.32s)]
*  stake, I can't. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1647.76s)]
*  But then you need to say that, right? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1648.86s)]
*  You need to admit and you need to say to your community and to Americans, hey, there's something [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1650.2s)]
*  really fundamental that has been lost here. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1655.3999999999999s)]
*  Does this mean that you are considering making concessions to the Trump administration? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1658.48s)]
*  I'm not considering any concessions. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1663.04s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1665.6s)]
*  No, look, we haven't been asked for anything, Rachel. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1666.6s)]
*  All the Trump administration has said to us and all the actually the funding agencies [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1669.72s)]
*  have said to us is that the grants are being suspended in general. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1674.4s)]
*  There are a small number of cancellations, but in general, they've said that they've [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1679.0s)]
*  been suspended pending a period of time during which the administration is determining whether [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1681.76s)]
*  or not the grants are in accordance with law. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1687.64s)]
*  So they haven't asked us to do anything. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1690.84s)]
*  But you likely will. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1692.56s)]
*  This is anything like the other universities. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1693.64s)]
*  They're probably going to be sending you some sort of a list. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1695.68s)]
*  Rachel, I don't know the answer to that question and I won't speculate about it. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1698.0400000000002s)]
*  But I believe it is essential for us to protect academic freedom. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1701.3200000000002s)]
*  OK, so let me just ask you specifically, like, let's just say that tomorrow the Trump administration [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1705.44s)]
*  says we want to put your I don't know if you have a Middle Eastern Studies Department, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1709.24s)]
*  but we want to put one of your departments under academic receivership or you don't get [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1713.0s)]
*  your money. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1716.48s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1717.48s)]
*  We would not do that. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1718.48s)]
*  We believe that that would be unlawful and we would contest that in court. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1719.48s)]
*  Which means potentially losing your funding, of course, from the government, as we've discussed. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1723.2s)]
*  I mean, I just sort of wonder, like, if you're willing to do battle over some of the demands [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1727.6s)]
*  that one might reasonably expect are coming, have you guys modeled how long you could last [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1731.28s)]
*  financially without the government's support as Princeton as is now? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1736.52s)]
*  Rachel, I mean, right now we are facing a variety of different threats to our funding [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1740.04s)]
*  model. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1746.24s)]
*  So just to be clear, because I think this needs to be there for me to answer your question, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1747.24s)]
*  there's the kind of risk that you just mentioned. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1751.44s)]
*  There are the threats to NIH funding or scientific funding more generally, right? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1753.42s)]
*  Not specific to us, but across universities. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1757.9s)]
*  There are proposals to increase the tax on the endowment and there are adverse economic [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1761.16s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1767.8200000000002s)]
*  My understanding is look at the stock market's down again rather significantly today. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1768.8200000000002s)]
*  It's probably sank more while we've been talking. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1772.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1773.6200000000001s)]
*  So we are modeling various kinds of risks to our enterprise. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1774.6200000000001s)]
*  What I would say, Rachel, is that in the moves that we could make to try to raise other revenue [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1779.1399999999999s)]
*  or to reallocate priorities to decide we're going to refocus certain kinds of funding [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1784.16s)]
*  on research and give up on some other things that we might be doing, those could enable [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1790.0s)]
*  us to deal with short-term losses while we try to overturn decisions that were a threat [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1795.44s)]
*  to our academic freedom. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1801.66s)]
*  Wait, just so I understand. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1802.66s)]
*  You guys are actively considering losing some functionality of the university in order not [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1804.0400000000002s)]
*  to have to capitulate to the government. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1808.48s)]
*  That's something that you're looking at? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1809.9s)]
*  What we are looking at is how best we can use resources to preserve the core mission [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1811.66s)]
*  of the university. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1817.3000000000002s)]
*  So look, I was the chief budgetary officer during the global financial crisis. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1818.3000000000002s)]
*  That was a 25% hit to our endowment. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1822.3400000000001s)]
*  We had to make around a $180 million adjustment at that point to our budget baseline. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1825.0s)]
*  We basically said under those circumstances, and those numbers, if you do the inflation [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1831.6200000000001s)]
*  adjustment on them, are comparable to our total federal research funding on the main [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1835.1000000000001s)]
*  campus. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1840.5s)]
*  We said we're going to protect three things that are critical to what it is we do. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1841.5s)]
*  That's our teaching, our research, and our affordability and access to the university. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1846.0600000000002s)]
*  And we're going to find ways to change other parts of our operation to draw upon other [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1850.26s)]
*  resources to allow for temporary increases to our endowment spend rate in order to get [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1855.7s)]
*  us through this period. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1861.42s)]
*  And Rachel, we can do that kind of thing, again, with temporary being an important word [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1862.8600000000001s)]
*  in there. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1867.8200000000002s)]
*  You can reallocate across purposes. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1869.02s)]
*  You can sustain your core for a period of time. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1871.88s)]
*  But if you're not able to change the basic fundamentals there, I mean, basically our [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1874.88s)]
*  endowment bounced back after the global financial crisis. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1878.3000000000002s)]
*  At that point, what you're doing is saying, okay, we're going to have to stop doing some [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1881.7s)]
*  of the things we're going to do. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1884.98s)]
*  Look at, you know... [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1886.66s)]
*  Like getting rid of departments. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1887.66s)]
*  That's what I was trying to get at. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1888.66s)]
*  Like, are you basically looking at different departments or different areas of the university [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1889.66s)]
*  that you would have to cut in order if this were to go on longer than a year or two? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1892.82s)]
*  Well, you know, the first things you look at, so we're already in what we would call [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1897.74s)]
*  a kind of a soft hiring freeze that extends both to our faculty and to our staff hiring. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1901.78s)]
*  So you, what I would say is you pull in your wings a bit on what it is you're doing. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1908.78s)]
*  If you're unable to take up, faculty members are coming to us all the time at places like [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1912.98s)]
*  this with research initiatives. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1917.94s)]
*  And some of the most exciting ones are often ones that they may not be able to get government [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1920.7s)]
*  funding for even in a kind of robust federal funding environment. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1925.18s)]
*  They're saying, if you make an initial investment here, right, we'll start doing things that [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1930.5s)]
*  are really exciting. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1934.7s)]
*  And then we'll be able to put this onto federal grants once we have proof of concept. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1935.74s)]
*  In these circumstances, we're able to do less of that. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1940.58s)]
*  And that's where you find yourself pulling back from what it is you've been doing. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1943.7s)]
*  Again, just like thinking as a lay person here listening to you, I guess my main burning [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1946.74s)]
*  question is like, are people at Princeton at your level saying, you know, maybe Princeton [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1950.18s)]
*  has to recede from being a leader in scientific research? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1955.46s)]
*  No, we are not. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1958.58s)]
*  But there are new initiatives that get harder to do areas that you want to see universities [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1960.26s)]
*  move into. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1965.02s)]
*  That you're not going to be able to do. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1966.02s)]
*  That people won't be able to move into. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1967.34s)]
*  I just want to point out, it sounds like you are saying you guys are doing your modeling, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1969.18s)]
*  you're doing your research, you're looking at your resources, and things will be fine. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1973.94s)]
*  You are going to figure out a way to adapt to this environment and continue doing the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1977.18s)]
*  work that the university is doing without capitulating in the ways that you have perhaps [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1981.26s)]
*  seen from your peers. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1985.66s)]
*  And that you can also probably adapt without giving up on research entirely. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1987.34s)]
*  There might be new areas you can't go into, but you will remain a research institution [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1990.6200000000001s)]
*  on the forefront of research. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1995.18s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is, on the one hand I hear you saying it's a crisis, on the other [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=1997.34s)]
*  hand I hear you saying it's going to be fine. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2001.06s)]
*  And I'm kind of just wondering sort of which is it. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2002.94s)]
*  I'm not saying it's going to be fine, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2004.5s)]
*  I just want to be clear about where are our commitments and our priorities and how are [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2006.42s)]
*  we going to do that. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2010.86s)]
*  And when I talk to you about what we're doing in the global financial crisis, we were laying [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2012.82s)]
*  off up people into the worst economy that existed in the United States since the Great [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2017.7s)]
*  Depression. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2022.3s)]
*  That's not things being fine, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2023.3s)]
*  Eventually universities will have to make choices about what they do around affordability [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2026.34s)]
*  and what they do around research if things get bad enough, right? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2030.7s)]
*  So our students right now, because of our endowment, we have 83% graduating with zero [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2033.3799999999999s)]
*  debt. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2039.46s)]
*  At some point you get to really tough choices about how good does your financial aid program [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2040.46s)]
*  have to be, right? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2044.08s)]
*  In order to be able to sustain the research that you do. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2045.36s)]
*  If you get contraction in what research is going on, you get some universities that go [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2049.14s)]
*  to other places, right? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2054.06s)]
*  That have to make judgments that we don't have to make about whether they're going [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2055.34s)]
*  to continue to accept the grants that support their medical schools or compromise on academic [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2058.86s)]
*  freedom. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2063.02s)]
*  Neither of those choices is fine. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2064.02s)]
*  There's nothing that's going to be fine if we don't restore simultaneously a respect [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2066.18s)]
*  for academic freedom without which you cannot be a great research university or this funding. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2071.22s)]
*  I'm just saying our choices are, you know, first of all, we have to protect academic [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2076.42s)]
*  freedom. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2081.02s)]
*  I do not think we can give up on that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2082.02s)]
*  And the right set of choices for us are ones that say, all right, we're going to reallocate [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2083.22s)]
*  around priorities that mean we're going to do research and teaching of the highest quality, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2087.8999999999996s)]
*  but not be able to do as much of it as we would otherwise do. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2092.94s)]
*  And I don't think that's fine for us, right? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2096.54s)]
*  And the choices get harder and harder the more the revenue streams come to bear. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2099.2999999999997s)]
*  At some point, you're going to get to places where even what I describe right now is not [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2103.3799999999997s)]
*  possible and things are going to get worse. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2107.8199999999997s)]
*  So things can get very bad. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2109.62s)]
*  I'm sure every university president is considering these questions and these considerations that [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2111.46s)]
*  you've outlined. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2116.06s)]
*  I sort of wonder, just to zoom out for a second, do you feel in the same way that you look [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2117.06s)]
*  at Columbia and you think, I really wish that they had said something about how they don't [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2121.38s)]
*  like this, how they find this disdainful, unproductive, whatever it was, do you feel [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2125.86s)]
*  pressure and an obligation to your fellow presidents, to your fellow universities, to [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2130.3s)]
*  the students at institutes of higher education around the country to really to fight back [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2134.46s)]
*  in some way? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2139.62s)]
*  How much of this is about the community that you are in and not just Princeton? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2140.62s)]
*  It's absolutely about the community that I'm in. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2144.98s)]
*  I've felt right since the beginning of my presidency, not just now, that everything [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2146.98s)]
*  we do at one university in the United States depends upon this extraordinary ecosystem [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2152.02s)]
*  of universities that we have. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2156.02s)]
*  We all depend on one another and the country depends on the network, right? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2157.58s)]
*  We educate a tiny fraction of students at Princeton and we depend on other universities [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2162.22s)]
*  partnering with us and we depend on them for the research that gets done. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2169.52s)]
*  I really think we all need to be speaking up right now. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2173.8s)]
*  It's important for me to be using my voice and it's why in response to a number of your [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2179.72s)]
*  questions I've said, hey, I can tell you about what's going on at Princeton, but I don't [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2183.68s)]
*  think this is all about Princeton. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2187.4s)]
*  It's about what's happening in the United States. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2188.84s)]
*  I think this would be so much stronger if many more of my fellow presidents were speaking up. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2191.1s)]
*  You're hoping that they do what you do. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2200.36s)]
*  I really want them to do what I do. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2201.72s)]
*  President Eisgruber, thank you so much for your time. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2207.68s)]
*  Rachel, thank you for the opportunity. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2209.48s)]
*  On Tuesday night, the Trump administration announced a new round of funding freezes, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2215.56s)]
*  this time directed at Cornell and Northwestern universities. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2220.56s)]
*  Officials said the moves come amid civil rights investigations into both schools and [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2224.36s)]
*  they bring the total amount of funding that's been suspended or canceled at universities [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2228.92s)]
*  across the country to more than three billion dollars. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2232.7200000000003s)]

*  And the Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked an order that would have forced the Trump [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2272.48s)]
*  administration to rehire thousands of federal workers. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdr-rQJPTe8&t=2277.0s)]
