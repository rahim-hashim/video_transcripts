# Stormy Daniels Takes The Stand
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKTjA5KBZc4)
*  It's 6.41 a.m.
*  Feeling a little stressed because I'm running late.
*  It's the fourth week of Donald J. Trump's criminal trial.
*  It's a white collar trial.
*  Most of the witnesses we've heard from have been, I think, typical
*  white collar witnesses in terms of their professions.
*  We've got a former publisher, a lawyer, accountants.
*  The witness today, a little less typical.
*  Stormy Daniels.
*  Porn star in a New York criminal courtroom.
*  In front of a jury more accustomed to the types of witnesses they've already seen.
*  There's a lot that could go wrong.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  What happened when Stormy Daniels took the stand for eight hours
*  in the first criminal trial of Donald J. Trump?
*  As before, my colleague, Jonah Bromwich,
*  was inside the courtroom.
*  It's Friday, May 10th.
*  So, it's now
*  day 14 of this trial. And I think it's worth having you briefly
*  and in broad strokes catch listeners up on the biggest developments
*  that have occurred since you were last on, which was the day that
*  opening arguments were made by both the defense and the prosecution. So just give us
*  that brief recap. Sure. It's all been the prosecution's case
*  so far. And prosecutors have a saying, which is that the evidence
*  is coming in great. And I think for this prosecution, which is trying
*  to show that Trump falsified business records to cover up a sex scandal
*  to ease his way into the White House in 2016, the evidence has been
*  coming in pretty well. It's come in well through David Pecker, former publisher
*  of The National Enquirer, who testified that he entered into a secret plot with
*  Trump and Michael Cohen, his fixer at the time, to suppress negative
*  stories about Trump the candidate. It came in pretty well through Keith Davidson,
*  who was a lawyer to Stormy Daniels in 2016 and negotiated
*  the hush money payment. And we've seen all these little bits
*  and pieces of evidence that tell the story that prosecutors want to tell. And the case
*  makes sense so far. We can't tell what the jury's thinking, as we always say,
*  but we can tell that there's a narrative that's coherent and that matches
*  up with the prosecution's opening statement. Then we come to Tuesday, and that day
*  really marks the first time that the prosecution's strategy
*  seems a little bit risky, because that's the day that Stormy Daniels gets called
*  to the witness stand. Okay, well, just explain why
*  the prosecution putting Stormy Daniels on the stand
*  would be so risky. And I guess it makes sense to answer that in the context of why the prosecution
*  is calling her as a witness at all.
*  Well, you can see why it makes sense to have her. The hush money payment was
*  to her. The cover up of the hush money payment in some ways
*  concerns her. And so she's this character who's very much
*  at the center of the story, but according to prosecutors, she's not at the center
*  of the crime. The prosecution is telling a story, and they hope a compelling
*  one, and arguably that story starts with Stormy Daniels. It starts
*  in 2006 when Stormy Daniels says that she and Trump
*  had sex, which is something that Trump has always denied. So if
*  prosecutors were to not call Stormy Daniels to the stand, you would have this big hole
*  in the case. It would be like effect, effect, effect, but where is the cause? Where is the person
*  who set off this chain reaction? But
*  Stormy Daniels is a porn star. She's there to testify about sex.
*  Sex and pornography are things that the jurors were not asked
*  about during jury selection, and those are subjects that bring up all kinds of
*  different complex reactions in people. And so when the prosecutors bring
*  Stormy Daniels to the courtroom, it's very difficult
*  to know how the jurors will take it, particularly given that she's about
*  to describe a sexual episode that she says she had with the
*  former president. Will the jurors think that makes sense as they
*  sit here and try to decide a falsifying business records case, or will they ask themselves
*  why are we hearing this?
*  So the reason why this is the first time that the prosecution
*  strategy is, for journalists like you, a little bit confusing
*  is because it's the first time that the prosecution seems to be taking
*  a genuine risk in what they're putting before
*  these jurors. Everything else has been kind of cut and dry
*  and a little bit more mechanical. This is just a wild card.
*  This is like live ammunition to some extent. Everything else
*  is settled and controlled and they know what's going to happen. With Stormy Daniels,
*  that's not the case. Okay, so walk us through
*  the testimony. When the prosecution brings her to the stand,
*  what actually happens?
*  It starts, as every witness does, with what's called direct examination,
*  which is a fancy word for saying prosecutors question Stormy Daniels,
*  and they have her tell her story. First they have her tell
*  the jury about her education and where she grew up and her professional experience,
*  and because of Stormy Daniels' biography, that quickly goes into stripping
*  and then goes into making adult films. And I thought the prosecutor who questioned her,
*  Susan Hoffinger, had this nice touch in talking about that because not only
*  did she ask Daniels about acting in adult films, but she asked
*  her about writing and directing them too, emphasizing the more professional aspects
*  of that work and giving a little more credit to the witness as if to say,
*  well, you may think this or you may think that, but this is a person with dignity who took what
*  she did seriously.
*  What's your first impression of Daniels as a witness?
*  It's very clear that she's nervous. She's speaking fast. She's laughing
*  to herself and making small jokes, but the tension in the room is so
*  serious from the beginning, from the moment she enters, that those jokes
*  aren't landing, so it just feels like really heavy and still and almost
*  oppressive in there. So Daniels talking quickly,
*  seeming nervous, giving more answers than are being asked
*  of her by the prosecution, even before we get to the sexual encounter that she's about
*  to describe, all that presents a really
*  discomforting impression, I would say.
*  And how does this move towards the
*  encounter that Daniels ultimately has?
*  It starts at a golf tournament in 2006 in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.
*  Daniels meets Trump there. There are other celebrities there too.
*  They chatted very briefly. And then she received a
*  dinner invitation from him. She thought it over, she says,
*  and she goes to have dinner with Trump, not at a restaurant, by the way,
*  but she's invited to join him in the hotel suite.
*  So she gets to the hotel suite and his bodyguard is there
*  and the hotel door is cracked open and the bodyguard greets her and says
*  she looks nice, this and that, and she goes in and there's Donald Trump, just as
*  expected. But what's not expected, she says, is that he's not wearing
*  what you would wear to a dinner with a stranger, but instead she says
*  silk or satin pajamas. She asks him to change, she says, and he
*  obliges, he goes and he puts on a dress shirt and dress pants and they
*  sit down at the hotel suite's dining room table and they have
*  a kind of bizarre dinner. Trump is asking her very personal questions
*  about pornography and safe sex and she testifies that she
*  teased him about how kind of vain and pompous he is. And then at some point
*  she goes to the bathroom and she sees that he has got
*  his toiletries in there, his Old Spice, his gold tweezers.
*  Very specific details. Yeah, we're getting a ton of detail in this scene.
*  And the reason we're getting those is because prosecutors are trying to elicit those details
*  to establish that this is a credible person, that this thing did happen,
*  despite what Donald Trump and his lawyers say, and the reason you can know it happened, prosecutors
*  seem to be saying, is because look at all these details she can still summon up.
*  She comes out of the bathroom and she says that Donald Trump is on the hotel
*  bed. And what stands out to me there is
*  what she describes as a very intense physical reaction. She says that she blacked
*  out and she quickly clarifies she doesn't mean from drugs or alcohol.
*  She means that, she says, that the intensity of this experience was such
*  that suddenly she can't remember every detail. The prosecution
*  asks a question that cuts directly to the sex, essentially did you start
*  having sex with him? And Daniel says that she did, and she
*  continues to provide more details than even I think the prosecution
*  wanted. And I think we don't want to go chapter and verse through
*  this claimed sexual encounter, but I wonder what
*  details stand out and which details feel important given the prosecution
*  strategy here. All the details stand out, because it's a story
*  about having had sex with the former president, and the more salacious and more
*  private the details feel, the more you're going to remember them. So we'll
*  remember that Stormy Daniels said what position they had sex in. We'll remember that she
*  said he didn't use a condom. Whether that's important to the prosecution's case,
*  now that's a much harder question to answer as we've been saying. But what I can tell you
*  is as she's describing having had sex with Donald Trump, and Donald
*  Trump is sitting right there, and Eric Trump, his son, is sitting behind
*  him, seeming to turn like a different color as he hears this embarrassment of
*  his father being described to a courtroom full of reporters at this trial,
*  it's hard to even describe the energy in that room. It was like nothing I
*  had ever experienced. It was just Daniels' testimony, and
*  seemingly the former president's emotions, and you almost felt like you were trapped in there
*  with both of them as this description was happening. Well I think it's important to try to understand
*  why the prosecution is
*  getting these details, these salacious
*  carnal, pick your word, graphic details about sex
*  with Donald Trump. What is the value if other details are
*  clearly making the point that she's recollecting something? Well I think at
*  this point we can only speculate, but one thing we can say is
*  this was uncomfortable. This felt bad. And remember, prosecutor's
*  story is not about the sex. It's about trying to hide this sex.
*  So if you're trying to show a jury
*  why it might be worthwhile to hide a story,
*  it might be worth providing lots of salacious details that a person would
*  want to hide. Exposing them to how bad that story feels, and reminding
*  them that if they had been voters and they had heard that story, and in fact they asked
*  Daniels this very question, if you hadn't accepted hush money, if you hadn't signed that
*  NDA, is this the story you would have told? And she said
*  yes. And so where I think they're going with this, but we can't really be sure yet,
*  is that they're going to tell the jurors, hey, that story,
*  you can see why he wanted to cover that up, can't you? You mentioned the
*  hush money payments. What testimony does Daniels offer
*  about that, and how does it advance the prosecution's case
*  of business fraud related to the hush money payments? So little evidence that it's
*  almost laughable. She says that she received the hush money, but we actually already
*  heard another witness, her lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson, testify
*  that he had received the hush money payment on her behalf. And she
*  testified about feeling as if she had to sell
*  this story because the election was fast approaching, almost as if her
*  leverage was slipping away because she knew this would be bad for Trump. That feels important,
*  but just tell me I understand why it's important. Well what the prosecution has been arguing
*  is that Trump covered up this hush money payment
*  in order to conceal a different crime. And that crime, they say,
*  was to promote his election to the presidency by illegal means.
*  Right, we've talked about this in the past. So when Daniels ties her side of the
*  payment into the election, it just reminds the jurors maybe, oh,
*  right, this is what they're arguing. So how does the prosecution end this
*  very dramatic and from everything you're saying, very tense questioning of Stormy Daniels
*  about this encounter? Well before they can even end,
*  the defense lawyers go and they consult among themselves, and then
*  with the jury out of the room, one of them stands up and he says that
*  the defense is moving for a mistrial. On what terms? He says that
*  the testimony offered by Daniels that morning is so prejudicial,
*  so damning to Trump in the eyes of the jury, that the trial
*  can no longer be fair. Like how could these jurors have heard
*  these details and still be fair when they render
*  their verdict? And he says a memorable expression, he says you can't unring
*  that bell, meaning they heard it, they can't unhear it, it's over,
*  throw out this trial, it should be done. Wow, and what is the response from the judge?
*  So the judge, Juan Roshon, he hears them out. I mean he really hears them out.
*  But at the end of their arguments, he says, I do think she went
*  a little too far. He says that. He said there were things that were better
*  left unsaid. By Stormy Daniels? By Stormy Daniels. And he
*  acknowledges that she's a difficult witness. But he says the remedy
*  for that is not a mistrial, is not stopping the whole thing right now,
*  the remedy for that is cross examination. If the defense feels that there are
*  issues with her story, issues with her credibility, they can ask her whatever
*  they want. They can try to win the jury back over. If they think this
*  jury has been poisoned by this witness, well this is their time to
*  provide the antidote. The antidote is cross examination,
*  and soon enough, cross examination starts.
*  And it is exactly as intense
*  and combative as we expected.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Jonah, how would you characterize the defense's overall strategy in this
*  intense cross examination of Stormy Daniels?
*  People know the word impeach from presidential impeachments, but has a
*  meaning in law too. You impeach a witness and specifically their credibility.
*  And that's what the defense is going for here. They are going to try to make Stormy Daniels look
*  like a liar, a fraud, an extortionist,
*  a money-grubbing opportunist who wanted to
*  take advantage of Trump and sought to do so by any means necessary.
*  And what did that impeachment strategy look like in the
*  courtroom? The defense lawyer who questions Stormy Daniels is a woman named
*  Susan Necklis. She's defended Trump before, and she's a bit of a cross examination
*  specialist. We even saw her during jury selection bring up these
*  past details to kind of confront jurors who had said nasty
*  things about Trump on social media with. And she wants to do the same thing with Daniels.
*  She wants to bring up old interviews and old tweets
*  and things that Daniels has said in the past that don't match
*  what Daniels is saying from the stand.
*  Hmm. What's a specific example, and do they land?
*  Some of them land and some of them don't. One specific example is that
*  Necklis confronts Daniels with this old tweet where Daniels says that she's going
*  to dance down the street if Trump goes to jail. And what she's trying to show there
*  is that Daniels is out for revenge, that she hates Trump, and that she wants to see
*  him go to jail. And that's why she's testifying against him. Got it. And Daniels is
*  very interesting during the cross examination. It's almost as if she's a different person.
*  She kind of squares her shoulders and she sits up a little straighter
*  and she leans forward. Daniels is ready to fight, but it doesn't
*  quite land. The tweet actually says, I'll dance down the street
*  when he's selected to go to jail. And Daniels goes off on this digression about how she knows
*  that people don't get selected to go to jail. That's not how it works. But she can't really
*  unseat this argument that she's a political enemy of Donald Trump. So that
*  one kind of sticks, I would say. But there are other moves that Necklis tries to pull
*  that don't stick. Like what? So unlike the prosecution,
*  which typically used words like adult, adult film, Necklis seems to be
*  taking every chance she can get to say porn or pornography or porn star
*  to make it sound base or dirty. And so when she starts to
*  ask Daniels about actually being in pornography, writing, acting, and directing
*  sex films, she tries to land a punch line. Necklis does.
*  She says, so you have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex appear to be
*  real, right? As if to say, perhaps this story you have told
*  about entering Trump's suite in Lake Tahoe and having sex with them
*  was made up. Just another one of your fictional stories about sex.
*  But Daniels comes back and says, the sex in the films,
*  it's very much real, just like what happened to me in that room.
*  And so when you have this kind of combat of lawyer cross
*  examining very aggressively and the witness fighting back,
*  you can feel the energy in the room shift as one lands a blow or the
*  other does. But here Daniels lands one back. And the other
*  issue that I think Susan Necklis runs into is she tries to draw out disparities
*  from interviews that Daniels gave, particularly to In Touch very early
*  on once the story was out. Kind of like a tabloid magazine. But some of the disparities
*  don't seem to be landing quite like Necklis would want. So she tries to
*  do this complicated thing about where the bodyguard was in the room when Daniels
*  walked into the room as described in an interview in a magazine.
*  But in that magazine interview, as it turns out, Daniels mentioned
*  that Trump was wearing pajamas. And so if I'm a juror, I don't care
*  where the bodyguard is. I'm thinking about, oh yeah, I remember that Stormy Daniels said
*  now in 2024 that Trump was wearing pajamas. I'm curious
*  if as somebody in the room, you felt that the defense was
*  effective in undermining Stormy Daniels credibility. Because what I took
*  from the earlier part of our conversation was that Stormy Daniels
*  is in this courtroom on behalf of the prosecution to tell a story
*  that's uncomfortable and has the kind of details that Donald Trump would be motivated
*  to try to hide. And therefore this defense strategy is to
*  say those details about what Trump might want to hide, you can't
*  trust them. So does this back and forth effectively
*  hurt Stormy Daniels credibility in your estimation?
*  I don't think that Stormy Daniels came off as perfectly
*  credible about everything she testified about. And there are incidents
*  that were unclear or confusing. There were things she talked
*  about that I found hard to believe when she, for instance,
*  denied that she had attacked Trump in a tweet or talked about her motivations
*  but about what prosecutors need, that central story,
*  the story of having had sex with him. We can't know whether it happened
*  but there weren't that many disparities in these accounts
*  over the years. In terms of things that would make me doubt the
*  story that Daniels was telling, details that don't add up, those weren't
*  present. And you don't have to take my word for that, nor should you.
*  But the judge is in the room and he says something very, very similar.
*  What does he say? And why does he say it?
*  Well, he does it when the defense again, at the end of the day,
*  on Thursday, calls for a mistrial. With a similar argument as before?
*  Not only with a similar argument as before, but like almost the exact same argument.
*  And I would say that I was astonished to see them do this, but
*  I wasn't because I've covered other trials where Trump is the client
*  and in those trials, the lawyers again and again called for a mistrial.
*  And what does Judge Marshawn say in response to this second effort
*  to seek a mistrial?
*  Let me say to this one he seems a little less patient. He says that after
*  the first mistrial ruling, two days before, he went into his
*  chambers and he read every decision he had made about the case.
*  He took this moment to reflect on the first decision. And he found
*  that he had, in his own estimation, which is all he has, been fair
*  and not allowed evidence that was prejudicial to Trump
*  into this trial. It could continue. And so
*  he said that again and then he really
*  almost turned on the defense and he said that the things
*  that the defense was objecting to were things that the defense
*  had made happen.
*  How so?
*  In his opening statement, the defense could have taken issue with many elements of the case
*  about whether they were falsified business records, about any of the other things
*  that prosecutors are saying happened. But instead,
*  he says, they focused their energy on denying that Trump ever had
*  sex with Daniels. And so that was essentially an invitation
*  to the prosecution to call Stormy Daniels as a witness
*  and have her say from the stand, yes, I had this sexual encounter.
*  The upshot of it is that the judge not only takes the defense to task
*  but he also just says that he finds Stormy Daniels' narrative credible.
*  He doesn't see it as having changed so much from year to year.
*  Interesting. So in thinking back to our original question here, Jonah, about
*  the idea that putting Stormy Daniels on the stand
*  was risky, I wonder if by the end of
*  this entire journey, you're reevaluating
*  that idea. Because it doesn't sound like it ended up being super
*  risky, it sounded like it ended up working reasonably well for the prosecution.
*  Well, let me just assert that it doesn't really matter what I think.
*  The jury is going to decide this. There's 12 people and we can't know what they're
*  thinking. But my impression was that while she was
*  being questioned by the prosecution for the prosecution's case, Stormy
*  Daniels was a real liability. She was a difficult witness for them and the judge said as much.
*  But when the defense cross-examined her, Stormy Daniels became a better
*  witness in part because their struggles to discredit her may
*  have actually ended up making her story look more credible and stronger.
*  And the reason that matters is because remember, we said that prosecutors
*  are trying to fill this hole in their case. Well, now they have. The jury has
*  met Stormy Daniels, they've heard her account, they've made of it what they will.
*  And now the sequence of events that prosecutors are trying to line up
*  as they seek prison time for the former president really makes a lot of
*  sense. It starts with what Stormy Daniels says with
*  sex in a hotel suite in 2006. It picks
*  up years later as Donald Trump is trying to win an election and
*  prosecutors say suppressing negative stories, including Stormy
*  Daniels' very negative story. And the story that prosecutors are telling
*  ends with Donald Trump orchestrating
*  the falsification of business records to keep that story
*  concealed.
*  Well, Jonah, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Of course, thanks for having me.
*  The prosecution's next major witness will be Michael Cohen,
*  the former Trump fixer who arranged for the hush money
*  payment to Stormy Daniels. Cohen is expected to
*  take the stand on Monday.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Thursday,
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a defiant
*  response to warnings from the United States that it would stop supplying
*  weapons to Israel if Israel invades the southern Gaza
*  city of Rafa. So far, Israel has carried out
*  a limited incursion into the city where a million civilians
*  are sheltering, but has threatened a full invasion.
*  In a statement, Netanyahu said, quote,
*  If we need to stand alone, we will stand
*  alone. Meanwhile, high-level
*  ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have been put
*  on hold, in part because of anger over
*  Israel's incursion into Rafa.
*  A reminder, tomorrow we'll be sharing the latest
*  episode of our colleagues' new show, The Interview. This week
*  on The Interview, Lulu Garcia Navarro talks with radio host
*  Charlamagne the God about his frustrations with how
*  Americans talk about politics.
*  If me as a black man, if I criticize Democrats,
*  then I'm supporting MAGA. But if I criticize
*  Donald Trump and Republicans, then I'm a Democratic shill.
*  Why can't I just be a person who deals in nuance?
