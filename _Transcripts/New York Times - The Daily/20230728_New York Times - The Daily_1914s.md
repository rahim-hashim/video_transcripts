# Menopause Is Having a Moment
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCZjypwb_Zc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Brussels Bureau Chief, Matina Stavris-Gridnev.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, New York Times magazine writer Susan Dominus, on menopause, she tells the story
*  of how it's been misunderstood for years, both in society and by doctors, and what happened
*  when her story about it went viral.
*  It's Friday, July 28th.
*  Okay, we're recording now.
*  So I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.
*  And one of them is just if you could describe to me some of the symptoms that you experienced.
*  Okay.
*  So when I first started, am I going to say menopause journey?
*  I think I'm actually going to.
*  When I first started the menopause journey, the first thing that I noticed were incredibly
*  heavy periods.
*  Night sweats.
*  Consistent, recurring.
*  Literally every two or three minutes.
*  Uncomfortable.
*  Hot flashes.
*  I'd wake up in the middle of the night with my hair, my pajamas, the pillow and sheets
*  soaked.
*  I would just lie in bed awake all night, sweating with my heart racing.
*  And I had small children.
*  And what I really noticed was that things that normally wouldn't bother me that they
*  were doing would send me into orbit.
*  I also did notice I would get actual migraines during my cycles.
*  I'd also get high anxiety.
*  So that was really affecting me.
*  My first sign was definitely hot flashes.
*  But then there was something that I hadn't heard about, which is all of the moisture
*  in my body left the building.
*  My eyes were dry.
*  My scalp was dry.
*  My nose was dry.
*  My mouth was dry.
*  And then just keep on moving down the body and just know that every single place that
*  was once moist was now dry.
*  I was born in the 70s and no one talked about menopause.
*  It's not really spoken about.
*  You know, I had told my doctors what I was experiencing and they just didn't really say
*  anything about it.
*  The doctor I saw was a younger woman, probably in her 30s.
*  She offered me supplements or anti-anxiety medication.
*  I think for myself, I thought I just kind of pushed through it.
*  Yeah, I would say it took me seven years before I got help.
*  Treatment options?
*  Did I have any treatment options?
*  I talked to my doctor and I got the same whole kind of, there's cancer in your family, you're
*  high risk.
*  So there's nothing you can do except, you know, basically wear cardigans because they're
*  the quickest sweater to take off.
*  So yeah.
*  Susan, you wrote a story for the New York Times Magazine this year that became one of
*  the most read stories of the year.
*  It got more than 3,000 comments on the article page, which is huge.
*  And it ignited a really big open conversation, which you yourself became a figure in.
*  It was about menopause.
*  Can you tell us why you wrote that story?
*  I was interested in writing about menopause because even some of the smartest, most can-do
*  women I knew, women who have tremendous agency and are great at research and are extremely
*  efficient, were completely baffled by the subject.
*  They were confused about their symptoms.
*  They were confused about how menopause works.
*  And they were absolutely searching for anything that would help them with the symptoms in
*  ways that were very rarely successful.
*  And then I myself started experiencing some of those symptoms.
*  I was having hot flashes that woke me up in the middle of the night and often sent me
*  into kind of an anxious spiral.
*  I was having strange discomfort in my abdomen.
*  I felt sort of strained.
*  My just body didn't feel familiar to me.
*  And I was really having problems with my memory.
*  Like what?
*  So I started having trouble recalling names, sometimes words.
*  It was bad enough that my friends, really my sister, was commenting on it.
*  And I also thought it was a real thing.
*  And I started thinking about a conversation I'd once had with a writer I really admire,
*  someone who I knew had retired pretty young.
*  When I saw her at a party at some point, I said to her, why did you stop writing?
*  And she said, because of menopause, the words just weren't coming.
*  And I honestly think I got almost like a little chill at the time.
*  And I've thought about it ever since.
*  So what did you do?
*  So it was time for me to see my OB, GYN anyway.
*  And I thought, you know what?
*  I'm going to bring these issues up with her.
*  They're enough of an issue in my life that I think it's worth talking about.
*  And I sort of described what I was going through, which was, I would say, on my mind, but they
*  weren't dramatic.
*  I wasn't having 17 hot flashes a day, some women do.
*  But when I mentioned them to her, I remember she said, we only treat significant symptoms.
*  And I definitely felt a little ashamed that I had dared to complain about these issues.
*  And I just was wondering to myself, well, all right, were they significant?
*  What does significant mean exactly?
*  I mean, they were significant enough to me that I brought them up, that they were on
*  my mind.
*  And how did this doctor's appointment end?
*  Did you end up asking for treatment?
*  Did you push back on this concept of significant symptoms?
*  No.
*  In her defense, doctors have such short windows, she had things to do, pap smears to take.
*  I just felt a little bad and left, basically.
*  So after that, I really wanted to start to get a handle on the material, or at least
*  to try to.
*  I was confused, my friends were confused, and I really wanted answers.
*  And when I started researching the topic, I realized pretty quickly that the history
*  of menopause in this country is sort of a history of misinformation or lack of information,
*  lack of research.
*  It's a topic that has just been so shrouded in ignorance, really, that it took a lot of
*  work to unearth facts that are well known to the medical community, but somehow haven't
*  really translated into information for everyday women.
*  Okay, so what is the history of menopause?
*  And how did you arrive at that conclusion?
*  So far as I know, women have been reaching menopause since time immemorial.
*  But we basically say that a woman is menopausal when a year has gone by and she has not had
*  her period for that period of time.
*  Perimenopause is the time leading up to that, which is a time of a lot of kind of intense
*  hormonal fluctuations.
*  It can last anywhere from four months to a decade.
*  And interestingly, there's research that suggests that for Latino women and Black women, it
*  can last even longer and start earlier.
*  But for a very long time, it was just something that women had to deal with.
*  And menopause was not exactly part of the mainstream conversation until 1966, when a
*  British gynecologist named Robert Wilson published a book called Feminine Forever.
*  And it shifted the conversation around menopause and what could be done about it and suggested
*  that hormone treatment, which had been around for a few years but wasn't widely used, could
*  keep women young and beautiful and sexual.
*  And the book was also sort of empowering in that way.
*  But it was also a little bit promising that maybe they'd be easier on their husbands and
*  they'd also be more desirable.
*  And there was this idea, you know, take estrogen because it'll make your husband's life better
*  too.
*  So for example, he writes, quote, all postmenopausal women are castrates, end quote.
*  But he said that if a woman were to use estrogen, quote, her breasts and genital organs will
*  not shrivel, she will be much more pleasant to live with and will not become dull and
*  unattractive, end quote.
*  Wow.
*  So it's like, here's this thing that will help alleviate women's suffering.
*  But basically, we're just going to package it with men in mind.
*  I think he was doing something complicated, which is he was genuinely helping women feel
*  empowered about their sex lives.
*  But it was, I think, at a moment in time when you couldn't just empower women.
*  You also needed to reassure their husbands maybe that there was something in it for them
*  as well.
*  But women seemed convinced and they start taking it in droves, frankly.
*  There was a brief blip in the mid 70s when doctors realized that taking estrogen alone
*  increased the risk of endometrial cancer.
*  So then they started adding in progesterone, which helped address that concern.
*  And after that, I would say hormone use resumed full force.
*  You know, over the years, it became part of popular culture.
*  There's a famous episode of the classic TV show from the 1970s, All in the Family, in
*  which poor Edith, the mother of the family, is really suffering from menopausal symptoms.
*  Hey, hey, there you are, G. We're waiting here.
*  We're starving.
*  Don't rush me, Archie Bunker.
*  You get your dinner on time.
*  You always get your dinner on time.
*  And they show her being unusually irritable and angry with everyone.
*  What's the matter with Ma?
*  I was going to ask you.
*  You know, she is going through these mood swings.
*  Oh my, it's so nice to be home.
*  Hey, Edith, you ain't mad at nothing?
*  Mad?
*  What would I be mad about?
*  Here's your beer.
*  You know, she starts taking these little pills to help her that the doctor prescribes.
*  Ah, it should be all right.
*  These are these hormones, which by the way, the hormones are pretty hot stuff, you know.
*  And so the culture really was reflecting the reality of just how commonly prescribed hormones
*  were at that time.
*  I've taken control of my life and I keep up on things that affect my health, like estrogen
*  loss and menopause.
*  Lauren Hutton, who was at the time a very admired former model turned actress, was featured
*  on a commercial for hormone therapy.
*  Ask your doctor what you can do to protect your health during and after menopause.
*  Believe me, the time to protect your future is now.
*  You know, one doctor said that people believed it was so great for women's health that this
*  one doctor told me she had it in one of the slides she would present saying that estrogen
*  should be in the water.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Meanwhile, as menopausal treatment is becoming incredibly popular, there was a faction of
*  activists who were really concerned that we really didn't know what the health benefits
*  were or the risks because there had never been a large randomized controlled trial to
*  study that.
*  And so in the mid-90s, the National Institutes of Health, led by Bernadine Healy, the first
*  female leader of the NIH, started this massive, massive randomized controlled trial that would
*  include research on the health benefits and risks of estrogen and progesterone.
*  So this is a significant investment in researching this basically critical stage in every woman's
*  life that so far just hadn't really been understood all that well.
*  Yes, there's no doubt that this was a really important moment in women's health history,
*  I would say.
*  So they recruit these thousands of women, they randomize the users of the hormone, they
*  have control group, it's going along.
*  And then in 2002, the people in charge of the trial call this huge press conference.
*  For the millions of women taking or considering the combination hormone therapy estrogen and
*  progestin, finally some conclusive answers.
*  And they announced that they are abruptly stopping the trial because they had found
*  they had reached a certain threshold of risk for women who were using the hormones, such
*  that they had no choice but ethically to stop the trial.
*  Wow.
*  The government is shutting down a major study of hormone replacement therapy in women because
*  of serious health concerns.
*  The combination of estrogen with progestin does not improve long-term health because
*  there's increased risk of breast cancer, of heart attacks, stroke, blood clots.
*  They found increased rates of heart disease, of clotting, of stroke and of breast cancer.
*  In the study, compared to women taking placebo, those on estrogen and progestin together had
*  a 22% higher risk of heart disease, 26% higher risk of breast cancer and a 41% higher risk
*  of stroke.
*  And as you can imagine, this was very, very big news.
*  Tonight, the wonder has come out of hormone replacement therapy.
*  I think the majority of women taking this combination therapy will be told by their
*  physicians to stop.
*  There's just this sense of dire concern that these risks were elevated and women responded
*  in droves to this fear and they were calling their doctors, they were throwing their hormones,
*  you know, flushing them down the toilet.
*  So it sets off basically a panic.
*  Yes.
*  One doctor I interviewed said that she remembered when JFK was shot, she remembered 9-11 and
*  she remembered the day of the WHI press conference because she had never received that many calls
*  in one day.
*  So clearly this is a huge shift for women and I have to imagine it comes with some anger.
*  The women were sort of given this treatment that was supposed to help them, but now they're
*  thinking it's actually putting them in danger of grave disease like cancer.
*  Yes, I think that's exactly right.
*  And I also think a lot of doctors felt a lot of guilt that they had been prescribing this
*  so aggressively to women of all ages under the assumption that it was going to be this
*  kind of miracle cure.
*  And so because of this press conference and the huge impact that it had, women really
*  stopped asking their doctors about it.
*  Doctors, not all, but many, kind of stopped prescribing it or recommending it and started
*  discouraging women from using menopausal hormone therapy.
*  And medical schools pretty much stopped teaching it.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And menopausal hormone therapy basically just fell off the map.
*  But here's the thing.
*  There's a way of looking at all that information that is much more nuanced and allows much
*  more for women's agency.
*  And because of the way the information was delivered and the way it was interpreted by
*  the medical community, millions of women probably have suffered needlessly over the decades
*  since.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Susan, you said that the findings from that big study and the risks of hormone therapy,
*  The way they were presented led to a misinterpretation.
*  How exactly was the study misinterpreted?
*  So there were several ways.
*  One thing we do know is that the public has a pretty poor understanding of how to think
*  about risk statistics.
*  So if a woman's risk of having breast cancer between the ages of 50 and 60 is around 2.33%,
*  If you increase that risk by 26%, which is what the study did find for the women who
*  were on those hormones, then you get something like 2.94%.
*  And that is an increase, but it might be small enough of an increase that for some women,
*  it would be a risk they'd be willing to take.
*  And it's a risk level that only kicks in after five years of use or so, by the way.
*  So I think there was not a lot of context.
*  When people hear something like a 26% increased risk, maybe they think, oh, that means I have
*  a 26% chance now of getting this cancer, or they don't know what the starting point is.
*  So it's hard to interpret it without really getting into the nitty gritty, but those things
*  are really important.
*  And there were a lot of good things that came out that were overlooked in the aftermath
*  of this huge news story about how dangerous they were.
*  So there was research that suggests that for women who start hormones in their 50s, you
*  know, before the age of 60 or within 10 years of going through menopause, that there actually
*  could be cardiovascular benefits if they started taking the hormone earlier rather than later.
*  And there was another arm of the trial that only studied women who had had hysterectomies,
*  who did not need to take progesterone.
*  And those women actually had a decreased risk of breast cancer and overall better long term
*  health outcomes, which is meaningful because something like a third of women by the age
*  of 50 have had hysterectomies.
*  But it wasn't the job of the people conducting these trials to evaluate quality of life issues.
*  That's not what they intended to do, and it really wouldn't have been appropriate.
*  But because that countervailing issue wasn't ever presented, I think it got lost in this
*  larger dialogue.
*  So actually, a better version of the coverage could have been something like hormone therapy
*  could mean increased risk of breast cancer and other things like stroke or blood clots.
*  But that risk is still limited and most importantly, should be weighed against the benefits that
*  we know that women experience through this treatment.
*  But instead, it was conveyed as representing this huge risk.
*  And so no wonder everyone basically stopped taking it.
*  I think that's really accurate.
*  It was understood to be a really dramatic, really scary risk.
*  Epidemiologically across the population, it's not nothing, it is a thing.
*  But just there was no context and there was no opportunity for women to have the agency
*  to think in an informed way about what that risk was.
*  So when you begin to engage in this question for yourself and you look at what your options
*  are, you're basically walking into a world that's sort of still dealing with the aftermath
*  of this misinterpretation and misunderstanding.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was walking into a world in which although there were always doctors who did prescribe
*  menopausal hormone therapy, it was really not well understood by doctors who were coming
*  up.
*  There were plenty of doctors who just were like, yeah, you've reached menopause, nothing
*  we can do about it.
*  I do think that there was a lot of a sort of casual suck it up tone that took over.
*  And to me, it sort of merges with the general misogynistic, ageist reality that older women
*  are the last group.
*  Disagreed can be the target of insensitive jokes, jokes about their undesirability, for
*  example.
*  It's just this feeling that older women are not treated with respect and care.
*  What do you think, Blanche?
*  Am I through with my cycle?
*  Well, I'd say menopause is a pretty good guess.
*  You're not as puffy as the Pillsbury Doughboy.
*  Especially dealing with menopause, or breast.
*  Oh, forget it.
*  Men just die.
*  Call her hot flash Drew.
*  I am so hot.
*  Drew Barrymore has a-
*  We even age out of the bad things like being fetishized or diminished or talked down to.
*  It's even worse.
*  You're invisible.
*  And this must be your mother.
*  My wife.
*  You're shamed.
*  You're unseen.
*  Oh, grody.
*  Then menopause.
*  A 67 year old woman in China gave birth this week.
*  The birth set a record for most friction.
*  You and I, I have to be honest that Jake Silverstein came to me, my editor at the New York Times
*  Magazine, the editor in chief, wanting me to write a big story about menopause.
*  And it's fascinating to me now that I actually hesitated.
*  I actually wasn't sure that it was a topic that I wanted to be too closely associated
*  with.
*  My college friends, when I told them that, they said, but that's why you have to write
*  the article is because it needs to be destigmatized.
*  And of course they were 100% right.
*  And I'm glad that I did because not only was it a pretty fascinating inquiry to me at least,
*  but it also brought me up to speed on the range of options that are now available to
*  women who are seeking relief from menopausal suffering.
*  Like what kind of options?
*  So there's really been a lot of development of other kinds of ways of administering hormones
*  for women who need care.
*  There are patches that are lower doses.
*  There's a micronized progesterone that it's hoped that that's closer to women's own progesterone
*  such that perhaps the risk of breast cancer might be lowered.
*  And for women with a cancer history who are not strong candidates for menopausal hormone
*  therapy, now there's a drug on the market.
*  Hopefully, insurance will eventually cover it called Vioza.
*  That is a non-hormonal option for treating hot flashes.
*  And there are new ways of getting good care from doctors trained in menopausal health
*  by telemedicine.
*  There are online subscription services that make it extremely easy to get access to the
*  hormones.
*  And obviously these things take time.
*  I think it's going to be a big learning curve, both for doctors and how to make this information
*  available in a way that is both concise but nuanced and for patients to learn that this
*  is something that they have the right at least to consider.
*  Right.
*  But also in the culture, especially in the past few years, there's been a new conversation
*  about menopause itself.
*  We're talking about what my friend Maria Shriver and I call the big M.
*  You know, Oprah has talked about it.
*  I too am a hormone taker.
*  Michelle Obama has talked openly about it.
*  Just hot flashes.
*  I mean, I had a few before I started taking hormones.
*  I remember having one on Marine One.
*  So I do think there's really positive change in all of this.
*  You cannot outrun, you cannot out-earn, you cannot out-exercise, you cannot out-yoga,
*  you cannot out-Fox the big M. You cannot.
*  The menopause train is coming no matter what.
*  So by the time my article was published...
*  This article just came out in the New York Times.
*  I think what I wrote really kind of hit a nerve.
*  Women have been misled about menopause.
*  But that was a nerve that was already a little bit live before I got there.
*  Susan, let's start with you because I've even had friends who've asked me about it as recently.
*  Unless you live under a rock, you most likely have seen it or been sent it by a friend.
*  That seemed to really connect with women who wanted a lot of information in one place.
*  ...is one of the best things as a woman in menopause I have ever read.
*  You're going to see yourself in the stories...
*  And a lot of, I think, frankly, voicing of what they had been going through.
*  I just think it was a quick way to convey to people around them that menopause is no joke.
*  You know, that it is a real thing in women's lives and it needs to be taken seriously.
*  It's shocking, frankly, that it hasn't been talked about from the rooftops for longer than it has.
*  So your article clearly struck this nerve.
*  But I'm wondering if you know whether things have actually shifted inside the doctor's office
*  for women who are literally going through this right now.
*  So I do think for women who are going through this now,
*  I'd like to think that the door has been opened for more of those conversations
*  by the work that's been collectively done.
*  I mean, just, you know, some doctors have told me that they have a QR code that they give to women
*  so that they can read the article.
*  Doctors have told me they now have waiting lists because so many people are coming in
*  to talk about something that they didn't realize was even a topic of conversation they should be engaging in.
*  I don't know, I personally found it very moving that my friend's daughter, a college student,
*  read this article, to me the idea that she's going to go through life feeling like this is not a mystery,
*  that she has some answers, that she knows, you know, the range of things that she might expect.
*  For me, it always just felt like this wave that was eventually going to come at me.
*  And I would just have to kind of figure out how to ride it whenever I got there, you know,
*  whether that was it going to mean I would stop writing?
*  Was it going to mean that I felt nothing as many women do?
*  Many women have minimal symptoms.
*  It's my hope that the information is out there and that women going through it don't just feel more empowered,
*  but like, you know, all women who are going to get there eventually.
*  Well, this woman has definitely been thinking about it in this conversation.
*  And yeah, I do feel more confident and more informed to face what will happen to me.
*  Yeah, I think what's exciting about this moment, and I do think that, you know, as the media says,
*  like menopause is having a moment.
*  I don't think it's really just about menopause.
*  And I don't think it's just about the symptoms.
*  And I don't think it's just about the treatment, although all of that is really important.
*  I think it's a moment of women who are older saying we are important and the things that we care about are important
*  and the things that we are talking about among ourselves.
*  That's important, not just to us, or at least it should be important to people other than us.
*  And maybe that important moment that you're describing that older women saying that we matter
*  will feed back into the doctor's office and will feed back into those appointments
*  where women go to find solutions and discuss menopause and their symptoms.
*  And their care in general.
*  Yeah, I like to think that there could be a kind of virtuous cycle in which, you know,
*  older women feel that they are being heard in the doctor's office,
*  which is, of course, not divorced from culture itself.
*  They do interact and that their care in general might even improve.
*  Right. Like maybe they won't be just offhand rebuffed.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you were.
*  That would be a good outcome for sure.
*  You know, I want to be clear, like I'm really not here to advocate for menopausal hormone therapy
*  for women because every woman's health condition is different.
*  Everybody's risk benefit analysis is different.
*  Everybody's profile is different.
*  But every woman should have the right to feel that there is time and space for the conversation
*  and to have their symptoms taken seriously, whatever they decide to do.
*  Susan, thank you.
*  Oh, thanks so much for having me on.
*  So, I'm curious, what did you end up doing?
*  What did you decide for yourself?
*  I am on...
*  I'm taking estrogen and progesterone, pretty low dose.
*  And I have to say that my hot flashes have completely gone away.
*  And I think I hadn't really appreciated how much they were bothering me until they did go away.
*  But I probably won't stay on them for more than five years at most,
*  because I do have a slightly elevated risk of breast cancer, given my family history.
*  But I know that in five years, I will probably have to do some real thinking and having some conversations
*  and gather information and, you know, make the best choice that I think I can make.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, federal prosecutors added major accusations to an indictment
*  charging former President Trump with mishandling classified documents after he left office,
*  saying he told a maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago
*  to delete potentially incriminating footage from a security camera.
*  The charges appear to strengthen prosecutors' case against Trump
*  as they prepare to charge him in a second case over his effort to overturn the 2020 election.
*  That indictment is expected to come in the next few days.
*  And in the latest evidence of global warming,
*  the month of July is now on track to be the hottest month in recorded history,
*  according to climate experts.
*  Last month, the United States was the hottest month in record history.
*  Last month was the world's hottest June.
*  And so far, 2023 is likely to be the world's hottest year, displacing 2016.
*  At the moment, the eight warmest years in recorded history are the last eight years.
