# The Walz-Vance Debate Civility and Then a Clash
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeiZL4eBAWU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Just three weeks after presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris engaged in
*  a fiery and often hostile debate, their running mates, JD Vance and Tim Walz, met for their
*  own debate and struck a very different chord.
*  Today, my colleague, political correspondent Reed Epstein, on why this debate was so different
*  and what it could mean for the race.
*  It's Wednesday, October 2nd.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  By the way, Reed Epstein has the largest barrel of M&Ms that I've ever seen.
*  You should have seen the bag of Sour Patch Kids that I bought.
*  To get through debate night.
*  To get through the VP debate night, you need some Sour Patch Kids.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Let's make a show.
*  Let's make a show.
*  Reed Epstein.
*  Sabrina.
*  So it is now 1217 a.m.
*  We are sitting in the studio.
*  You have brought me some M&Ms, which I'm very happy about.
*  And there's a sort of conventional wisdom in presidential elections that vice presidential
*  debates are not that important.
*  Usually by this point in the campaign, voters have had a lot of time to get to know both
*  the top and the bottom of the tickets.
*  They're pretty well decided about how they feel about the candidates.
*  But this year is different.
*  We had one candidate drop out, Joe Biden.
*  Kamala Harris, the current VP, moved to the top of the Democratic ticket and very quickly
*  chose her running mate, Tim Walz.
*  And on the Republican side, Donald Trump announced a new running mate in JD Vance.
*  All of this, of course, happened very quickly in the course of two months.
*  So going into the debate, what did we know about these two VP candidates and what they
*  were bringing to their tickets?
*  Well, let's describe a little bit about who these people are.
*  The first to be named to the ticket was JD Vance, the Ohio senator who was first elected
*  just two years ago.
*  Vance wrote a bestselling book in 2016.
*  Hillbillyology.
*  Hillbillyology.
*  And he ran for the Senate in 2022.
*  He's relatively new to national politics.
*  He has a relatively undistinguished Senate career, as most new senators do.
*  Relatively short.
*  And he's only 40 years old, which is young to be on a national ticket.
*  How would you describe him?
*  He brooks no quarter.
*  He is a very smooth articulator of the Trump agenda and seems to always be fighting in
*  a way that clearly pleases the former president.
*  And what about Walz?
*  You know, Walz had a long career in Minnesota politics and a long career as a public school
*  teacher before that.
*  Former high school football coach.
*  He grew up in Nebraska.
*  He was named to the ticket in part because he was good on television articulating the
*  Democratic agenda and fighting back against some of the ideas that animate Trump and JD
*  Vance.
*  And he, of course, coined the idea that they were weird and that their ideas were weird
*  at the time when that idea spread across sort of the entire Democratic universe.
*  Okay, so both candidates were picked in part because they're good communicators for their
*  side.
*  So in tonight's debate, what was their primary mission?
*  What was their job?
*  Well, their first goal was to not make any mistakes that can be weaponized against them.
*  The second goal was to make a case against the top of the opposing ticket.
*  And the third thing they needed to do was to make themselves appear as plausible and
*  credible presidents of the United States and commanders in chief.
*  And that was especially acute for JD Vance since his running mate is 78 years old.
*  So how did they begin?
*  We're going to begin tonight with the Middle East.
*  Margaret, thank you, Nora.
*  So the first question was about the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran.
*  Governor Walz, if you were the final voice in the situation room, would you support or
*  oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?
*  You have two minutes.
*  Well, thank you.
*  And thank you for those joining home tonight.
*  And Tim Walz did not sound at all sure of himself in his answer.
*  Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fine.
*  He seemed to confuse Israel and Iran in describing their actions.
*  Now, the person closest to them, to Donald Trump, said he's unfit for the highest office.
*  That was Senator Vance.
*  He was sort of slow in his manner of speech.
*  He paused a couple of times.
*  Defending itself is absolutely fundamental.
*  He used the word fundamental four times in that opening answer.
*  I noticed that.
*  Fundamental, fundamental.
*  But what's fundamental here is...
*  It did not look great for him at the start.
*  And as the vice president said today is, we will protect our forces and our allied forces,
*  and there will be consequences.
*  Governor, your time is up.
*  Senator Vance, the same question.
*  And Vance seemed very polished.
*  I want to answer the question, but I want to actually give an introduction to myself
*  a little bit because I recognize a lot of Americans don't know who either one of us are.
*  He opened with his biography.
*  My mother required food assistance for periods of her life.
*  My grandmother required Social Security help to raise me.
*  He sounded more folksy.
*  And he answered the question in a way that Walls didn't.
*  And look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.
*  By saying that Israel is our ally and will stand by whatever decision they make.
*  I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.
*  Where Walls sort of talked and talked and didn't really respond to the question.
*  Yeah, he didn't land an answer, whereas Vance did.
*  Vance did.
*  And Vance also sounded like he knew more about the situation in that moment than Walls did,
*  just by the nature of his presentation.
*  Well, to that point...
*  The economy is a top concern for voters.
*  One of the first issues that really popped for me was this issue of the economy.
*  And Vance kind of comes out of the gate and really just does this thing that Trump failed to do
*  in the debate with Harris, which is put his finger on this idea that the working class
*  had been shafted by the political class in the United States.
*  Right.
*  Now, Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan, but it's also a record.
*  A lot of those same economists...
*  So Vance lays out a fairly compelling case about how all the experts that the government
*  had relied on over the years were wrong about international trade.
*  But those same experts for 40 years said that if we shipped our manufacturing base off to China,
*  we'd get cheaper goods.
*  They lied about that.
*  They said if we shipped our industrial base off to other countries, to Mexico and elsewhere,
*  it would make the middle class stronger.
*  They were wrong about that.
*  And about manufacturing and about engaging with Mexico and China.
*  And Vance talked about how that hurt the middle class in small towns like where he grew up.
*  ...generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan
*  consensus, we're not doing it anymore.
*  We're bringing American manufacturing back.
*  We're unleashing American energy.
*  We're going to make more of our own stuff.
*  And this isn't just an economic...
*  And Vance probably had his strongest moment of the debate in this discussion.
*  And he did a compelling job of explaining Trump's vision in a way that really sanded
*  the hard edges off of Trumpism in general.
*  This has to stop.
*  And we're not going to stop it by listening to experts.
*  We're going to stop it by listening to common sense wisdom, which is what Donald Trump
*  governed on.
*  Senator, your time is up.
*  Governor Walz, can you address that?
*  And how did Walz respond to that?
*  If you're listening tonight and you want billionaires to get tax cuts, you heard what
*  the numbers were.
*  Look, I'm a union guy on this.
*  He gave the standard response to Trump's economic plan from the Democrats give.
*  They said that he would give tax cuts to billionaires.
*  Donald Trump was the guy who created the largest trade deficit in American history with China.
*  And he talked about Trump losing a trade war with China when he was president.
*  I'm not a guy who wanted to ship things overseas, but I understand.
*  He didn't really engage that much in Vance's argument that the experts let us down this
*  path.
*  But he tried to make an argument against Trump's economic policies in general.
*  And he kind of was struggling.
*  I mean, he doesn't have a great case to make because inflation is high and housing prices
*  have risen.
*  And, you know, the economy is generally a weak point for Democrats.
*  It's a weak point, but it's one that where they're getting better.
*  But Walz did not make a crisp case on their behalf here.
*  So Vance really looked on stage like he just was kind of breezing along.
*  And, you know, he was delivering these arguments that were really the Republicans' best issues.
*  He was doing them well.
*  And, you know, just generally he was owning the stage.
*  Walz wasn't really breaking through at all until you got to the issue of abortion, which
*  you and I were watching this together, Reed.
*  It was about at the 44 minute mark.
*  44 minutes, almost exactly midway through was when the first question about abortion
*  came up.
*  This is an issue that the Harris campaign once injected into the bloodstream of every
*  conversation.
*  And Walz did quite well here.
*  He talked about how the Trump argument that this is an issue left for the states means
*  that human rights are different depending on what state you live in.
*  He talked about women who have died or become gravely ill because they didn't have access
*  to health care that had been available before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
*  And he made this case that health care decisions are best left to women and the doctors that
*  treat them.
*  What about Vance?
*  What about his response?
*  Senator?
*  They may respond to that.
*  First of all, Governor, I agree with you.
*  Amber Thurman should still be alive.
*  And there are a lot of people who should still be alive.
*  And I certainly wish that she was.
*  Vance gave what was probably the most effective response available to him given his and Trump's
*  positions on abortion.
*  That's why Donald Trump and I are committed to pursuing pro-family policies, making child
*  care more accessible, making fertility.
*  He talked about giving women options to continue pregnancies and ways to help the Republicans
*  be pro-family.
*  I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies.
*  I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place
*  to raise that family.
*  And I think there's so much that we can do.
*  Which is not exactly been their strong suit.
*  And Reed, what did you make of Vance's response, though?
*  I mean, it felt like a bit of a sleight of hand that he was doing, kind of like he was
*  performing a magic trick.
*  He was saying, on the one hand, I kind of feel for women on this issue, but I really
*  support IVF.
*  He was kind of doing this doublespeak in a way.
*  Well, and he was trying to explain Donald Trump's position more than he was his own
*  position.
*  He said it is a matter left for the states to decide.
*  He said the proper way to handle this.
*  As messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions.
*  Is to let voters make these decisions for themselves and let the states set their own
*  abortion policy.
*  We can be a big and diverse country where we respect people's freedom of conscience
*  and make the country more pro-baby and pro-family.
*  But please.
*  And it was an exchange that walls really did not let him get away with.
*  These are women's decisions to make about their health care decisions and the physicians
*  who know best when they need to do this.
*  And Vance, for the first 45 minutes of the debate, had been in command of the event.
*  And once this discussion shifted to abortion, it was Vance who struggled to explain the
*  policies of his ticket and Walls who was on offense.
*  It marked a shift in this debate that we saw play out over the second half.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Reed, you said that the tide of the debate really changed with the abortion
*  discussion right about midway.
*  Where did it go next?
*  What stood out to you in that second half?
*  Welcome back to the CBS News vice presidential debate.
*  We want to turn now to America's gun violence epidemic.
*  You know, the first moment of the second half was a discussion about gun control and gun violence.
*  Governor, you have two minutes.
*  Well, I thank all the parents watching tonight.
*  This is just your biggest nightmare.
*  Look, I got a 17-year-old and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.
*  Those things don't leave you.
*  And Walls introduced this story that he's told a couple times about his 17-year-old son
*  witnessing a shooting while playing volleyball in a community center in Minnesota.
*  It was a pretty raw story.
*  As he said this, you could see Vance flinch a little bit.
*  And for all the preparations and the practice, Vance had not prepared himself for this moment.
*  Senator?
*  Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting.
*  I'm sorry about that.
*  I appreciate you saying so.
*  Christ have mercy.
*  It is awful.
*  And he said he didn't know that Gus Walls had witnessed a shooting.
*  And it was a moment of humanity that we don't often see in these situations.
*  It was Vance as a father, not in the way where he talked about his own kids to make a political
*  point, but a way you could see him having real empathy for Walls' son in a way that hadn't come
*  across in any of the rest of the policy debates.
*  It was a fascinating look at how Vance dealt with a real-life situation.
*  But then...
*  Let's turn now to the top contributor to inflation, the high cost of housing and rent.
*  There was a discussion about housing.
*  There was a discussion about federal lands.
*  ...the houses in the same federal land.
*  There was sort of more about immigration.
*  ...blame immigrants for higher housing prices.
*  The discussion was much more policy-based.
*  And it got very in the weeds and wonky.
*  Yeah, I was really surprised at just how much policy was there.
*  It's like I felt like I hadn't heard it in a long time.
*  We're so used to Trump with his own kind of gravitational force.
*  And those debates sound different.
*  This sounded like an old school political debate where people talked about policy and,
*  you know, were civil to one another.
*  It was less about the personalities of the figures on stage than it was about what they
*  would do in office.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, it struck me that Vance was very good at repackaging and repurposing Trump's message.
*  I mean, he kind of put it through this like, you know, civility normalization machine.
*  And it popped out and it sounded pretty good.
*  I mean, Vance is very skilled at making Trump sound reasonable.
*  And making his ideas come across in a way that don't sound perhaps as scary or sharp-edged
*  as Trump does when he sort of as a blunt force instrument delivers them as the only possible
*  solution and anyone who says anything different is wrong and anti-American.
*  Right.
*  But he could only go so far.
*  Let's talk about the state of democracy, the top issue for Americans after the economy
*  and inflation.
*  So where did Vance hit up against the limits of being able to sell Trump's policies?
*  In the same place that a lot of Republicans find themselves at odds with reality, and
*  that's the 2020 election.
*  Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last presidential election.
*  Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results?
*  He was asked if he would seek to challenge this year's presidential election results,
*  even if every governor in America certifies them at the state level.
*  Look, what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020.
*  And my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues
*  peacefully in the public square.
*  And Vance tried to pivot.
*  And it's Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans,
*  she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation.
*  I think that is a much bigger threat to democracy than anything that we've seen in this country.
*  He didn't really answer the question.
*  He said censorship is a bigger threat to democracy than Donald Trump saying protesters should
*  peacefully protest the election.
*  Governor?
*  Well, I've enjoyed tonight's debate, and I think there was a lot of commonality here.
*  And I'm sympathetic to misspeaking on things, and I think I might have with the senator.
*  Me too, man.
*  But there's one.
*  There's one, though, that this one is troubling to me.
*  And I say that because I think we need to tell the story.
*  And Walls didn't buy this for a minute.
*  140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day.
*  He talked about January 6 protesters.
*  In Minnesota, a group gathered on the state Capitol grounds in St. Paul and said,
*  we're marching to the governor's residence and there may be casualties.
*  The only person there was my son and his dog who was rushed out crying by state police.
*  Not just in Washington, but coming after his home in St. Paul, Minnesota.
*  When Mike Pence made that decision to certify that election, that's why Mike Pence isn't on this
*  stage.
*  He said at one point, if Mike Pence had not certified the election, he would still be
*  Trump's running mate today.
*  And then Walls asked the question that JD Vance is unable to answer.
*  ... lose the election.
*  I would just add to that.
*  Did he lose the 2020 election?
*  Which is, did Trump lose the 2020 election?
*  Tim, I'm focused on the future.
*  Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of...
*  And Vance doesn't answer it.
*  He says he's focused on the future and he tries to pivot back to asking,
*  did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their minds about COVID in 2020?
*  He totally dodges.
*  That is a damning non-answer.
*  It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship.
*  Obviously...
*  And Walls points that out to everyone watching and he called it a damning non-answer.
*  And Vance tried to save himself by saying it was damning for Walls not to talk about censorship.
*  But that wasn't what the question was about.
*  And frankly, it is less of a threat to democracy than the question of free and fair elections.
*  But this whole exchange really illustrated the red lines that nobody in Trump's world can cross,
*  which are, you can't say that Trump lost the election.
*  You can't blame Trump for January 6th.
*  You can't say that he incited the riot.
*  And so it was a very skilled moment from Walls,
*  who didn't look particularly skilled for much of the night,
*  to pose that question to Vance knowing that it was one that Vance couldn't answer.
*  And that was the last big moment of the debate.
*  And thank you both for participating in the only vice presidential debate of this election cycle.
*  And what did you make of that moment?
*  You know, I think this is the moment that we'll remember from this debate.
*  Vance had spent at this point an hour and a half ably answering most of the questions that came
*  across and the ones that were trickier, he sort of talked his way through.
*  And then he got what might have been the easiest question of the night,
*  who won the last election?
*  And he's not able to answer it.
*  You know, that idea that he is not saying everything that he knows,
*  or hiding something, or altering his remarks to please someone else
*  is a very dangerous proposition in politics,
*  because it suggests that he's not leveling or being straight with people.
*  And if Vance has that stripped from him at this stage,
*  that he can't be trusted on the basic question of democracy,
*  it's a difficult thing for him to overcome on other issues.
*  But does this have an effect electorally?
*  I mean, are undecided voters actually watching a vice presidential debate?
*  Probably not.
*  But that moment is, as we speak, being cut into ads
*  that the Harris campaign will be showing to people as soon as Wednesday morning.
*  And even though the Harris campaign and Democrats have not pushed democracy
*  to the forefront of their campaign, just because voters tend to be more motivated by
*  issues like healthcare and abortion, the idea that you can't trust J.D. Vance to tell you the truth,
*  I think, is going to be one that they make central to the aftermath of this debate.
*  This strikes to his honesty and his truthfulness in a way that can be very damaging.
*  And this debate, like the last one, likely won't produce any major
*  shift in the polls that we see in the next couple weeks.
*  But you have to remember, this is an election on the margins.
*  And we're really talking about a couple hundred thousand voters in the seven battleground states
*  moving one way or the other that will determine who the next president is.
*  Tens of millions of people will have watched this debate and 70 million people watched the last
*  debate. But these candidates to win the election need to talk to just a tiny slice of voters
*  in just a few states. And those are the ones whose judgment will determine the future of the country.
*  Thank you for talking. I'm going to bed. Good night.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, Iran fired about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in what it called a retaliation
*  for Israel's surprise assassination on Friday of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah,
*  a group that is backed by Iran. The killing of the long time foe of Israel and the United States
*  shocked the Middle East and was seen as a major victory for Israel.
*  The missile attacks sent millions of Israelis into bomb shelters,
*  but appeared to inflict little damage. Above all, the airstrikes upended the assumption
*  among Israelis that the country's increasingly brazen approach toward Iran and its allies
*  would deter Iran from attacking Israel. And
*  No, no, no, no work.
*  Tens of thousands of unionized dockworkers from Maine to Texas have gone on strike,
*  stranding cargo at many of the country's busiest ports and potentially disrupting the American
*  supply chain. The dockworkers, whose contract expired on Monday, are demanding a 62% increase
*  in pay, a number that port operators have so far refused to meet.
*  Finally, Mr. President, on behalf of the entire Biden family and the American
*  people, happy 100th birthday.
*  Nineteen months after entering hospice for what many feared would be his final
*  days, former president Jimmy Carter has turned 100 years old, becoming the first
*  U.S. president to reach that milestone.
*  Jimmy, thank you for your friendship, your example, and for always finding
*  new ways to remind us that we are all created in God's image.
*  Happy birthday.
*  To celebrate the occasion,
*  You've had a heck of a life and you're surrounded by people who love you.
*  Several former presidents paid tribute to Carter on Tuesday.
*  May God bless you in your final years.
*  May you have peace of mind and peace in your heart.
*  For his part, Carter marked the day in the backyard of his home in Plains,
*  Georgia, where four F-18 fighter jets flew overhead in his honor.
