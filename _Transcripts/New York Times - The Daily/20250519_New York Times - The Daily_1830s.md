# No More Refugees, Trump Said. Except White South Africans.
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=4.36s)]
*  For decades, white South Africans ruled with an iron fist, overseeing the country's cruel [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=13.24s)]
*  system of racial oppression. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=19.96s)]
*  So why is President Trump now welcoming them to the U.S. as victims? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=23.52s)]
*  Today, John Eligo on how the MAGA movement became obsessed with Afrikaners. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=30.64s)]
*  It's Monday, May 19th. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=46.28s)]
*  John, welcome back to The Daily. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=54.52s)]
*  Hi, good to be here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=56.52s)]
*  I don't know if you remember this, but the last time we spoke was four years ago, almost [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=58.52s)]
*  to the month, because in the middle of the interview, my wife began to give birth to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=63.96s)]
*  our son. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=68.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=69.48s)]
*  She went into labor and we did not finish the conversation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=70.48s)]
*  Well, hopefully we don't have that problem again this time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=72.68s)]
*  No, no, no chance. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=75.56s)]
*  So on to the topic of Dan. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=78.92s)]
*  John, since taking office, the Trump administration has really systematically shut down the programs [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=81.48s)]
*  that designate and bring refugees into the United States from around the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=90.84s)]
*  And then a few days ago, the White House made a pretty big exception to that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=97.0s)]
*  But I want you to just start with the shutting down process for just a moment. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=102.12s)]
*  Yeah, so essentially when Trump came into office, we know he had this flurry of executive [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=106.68s)]
*  orders that he signed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=110.96s)]
*  And among those executive orders was an order that essentially suspended the refugee program. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=112.55999999999999s)]
*  So this is essentially a program where you have people who are in war-torn places like [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=119.0s)]
*  Sudan or who've been driven from Sudan, people in the Democratic Republic of Congo where [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  there's an ongoing war for decades now, tens of thousands of Afghans who had been approved, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=130.24s)]
*  they had been screened and they'd been ready to come over to the U.S. to be resettled. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=136.04s)]
*  And by suspending the program, you essentially stop all that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  And can you remind us what President Trump's rationale was for doing that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  His broad rationale is that, hey, this is something that threatens the interests of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=149.04s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=152.6s)]
*  So they've talked about how bringing in refugees who are not properly vetted for security reasons [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=153.6s)]
*  could come in and harm the country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=159.16s)]
*  And there's also been talk about economically what it could do to the country, that the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=161.04s)]
*  country could be overburdened and overwhelmed with foreigners and that can really hamper [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=164.76s)]
*  the country rather than help it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=169.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=170.84s)]
*  And I think that brings us to this very surprising scene we saw just a few days ago. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=171.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=177.72000000000003s)]
*  So even though Trump suspended this refugee program, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  It is such an honor for us to receive you here today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  This is the land of the free. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=185.52s)]
*  We had dozens of refugees arriving at Dulles Airport and they certainly did not look like [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=188.24s)]
*  all of those who'd been suspended from coming. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  I know you've gone through a long flight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=195.68s)]
*  I cannot believe there are babies and children who are actually so well behaved. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=197.84s)]
*  This is much better than mine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=202.68s)]
*  So these were white South Africans, specifically Afrikaners, who are an ethnic minority in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=206.32s)]
*  South Africa. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=213.72s)]
*  Many of us, our families have had a journey not that different from the journey that you [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  are embarking on today. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=219.68s)]
*  My own father was born in Europe and had to leave his country. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=222.2s)]
*  They had a lot of luggage, you know, all their belongings. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=229.2s)]
*  They came into an airport hangar and they were given this big reception by some of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=232.64s)]
*  top officials in the U.S. government welcoming them here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=237.44s)]
*  We look forward to after this to be able to spend a little bit of time with you and get [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=240.88s)]
*  to talk to you guys. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=244.28s)]
*  So thank you guys. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=245.6s)]
*  So about a month after Trump signed that executive order suspending the refugee program, he signed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=250.88s)]
*  another executive order that essentially allowed this group of Afrikaners to come to the United [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=256.6s)]
*  States as refugees. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=262.68s)]
*  So essentially what Trump was saying was that they can open the refugee program for this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=264.36s)]
*  small group of white South Africans, but them alone. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=270.0s)]
*  So what's the story of how this group of white South Africans somehow becomes the single [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=274.42s)]
*  exception to President Trump's deeply skeptical relationship to refugees? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  The one group that gets through. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=288.3s)]
*  Well let me tell you a little bit about the Afrikaners, Michael, because it goes back [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  a long way. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=294.48s)]
*  So back in 1652, Jan van Riebeek was a Dutch settler who sort of started the colonial settlements [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=295.48s)]
*  what's now South Africa. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=302.86s)]
*  And over time these Dutch settlers, as well as other settlers from Germany, from France, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  and other parts of Europe would come in. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=309.7s)]
*  And out of that would sort of rise this new ethnicity called Afrikaners, which is a mix [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=312.18s)]
*  of these various European settlers who came in and settled there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=317.5s)]
*  And pretty early on, with the locals who were already in South Africa at the time, there [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=321.98s)]
*  were clashes, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=326.54s)]
*  I mean, there were fights over land. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=327.54s)]
*  There were struggles and tensions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=329.42s)]
*  And the story gets even more complicated over the years as the British come to South Africa, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=331.62s)]
*  right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=336.18s)]
*  And while the British took a lot of the economic power in the country, the Afrikaners amassed [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=337.18s)]
*  political power. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=344.14s)]
*  And so then came elections in 1948, which black people were not allowed to participate [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=345.74s)]
*  in. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=350.46s)]
*  And in that election, an Afrikaner-led party won control of the government. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=351.46s)]
*  And once they took power, they created a system that we all know today, that system [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=357.18s)]
*  of apartheid. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=361.62s)]
*  So Afrikaners end up becoming the group that enforces the really brutal rules of segregation [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=363.16s)]
*  that come to define South Africa. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=370.52s)]
*  Yes, Michael. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=373.02s)]
*  So they essentially form this government that relegates black South Africans, the majority [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=374.4s)]
*  population, to essentially subhuman status. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=380.38s)]
*  They kick them off their land. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=383.4s)]
*  They forced them to live in these ramshackle townships that got no resources, oftentimes [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=385.5s)]
*  didn't have water or electricity or anything like that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=390.54s)]
*  Their movements, the movements of the black majority, were very tightly controlled. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=394.22s)]
*  They needed special passes if they wanted to go into cities or towns. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=398.46s)]
*  The areas with the most arable farmland, those were not areas where black people were allowed [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=402.78s)]
*  to settle. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=408.02s)]
*  Those were areas that the white population was able to take over. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=409.02s)]
*  And this system ruled for nearly 50 years until the early 1990s when you started to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=412.42s)]
*  see much of the world turn against the system. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=419.82s)]
*  And you started to see this sort of crumble and the Afrikaners had to sort of give way [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=424.26s)]
*  to the black majority. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=428.1s)]
*  And what does that look like for the Afrikaners who have amassed so much power to have to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=429.90000000000003s)]
*  give it up? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=437.06s)]
*  So toward the end of the apartheid system, there were vigorous negotiations over what [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=438.06s)]
*  the Afrikaners would give up, what they would keep, and what black people would get. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=445.14s)]
*  And essentially what was negotiated at the time was a system in which black people would [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=451.14s)]
*  get their political power. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=457.34000000000003s)]
*  But through those negotiations, Afrikaners were not really forced to give up their economic [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=459.38s)]
*  status. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=464.9s)]
*  They were not forced to give up land. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=466.08s)]
*  Essentially it was a relatively peaceful transition. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  It sounds like they're treated surprisingly well given the circumstances of what they [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=471.8s)]
*  had inflicted on the majority that's now suddenly in power. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=476.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=480.44s)]
*  And to this day in South Africa, you will hear one of the big criticisms about Nelson [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=481.44s)]
*  Mandela, who was the hero of the anti-apartheid movement as much of the world knows him, is [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=485.88s)]
*  enough to aggressively force a change that you essentially had the system where a small [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=491.96s)]
*  percentage of white people held most of the wealth, where you had this large population [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=499.08s)]
*  of black people who were still in poverty and did not have much wealth at all. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=508.44s)]
*  Even after apartheid. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=509.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=510.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=511.44s)]
*  And Mandela's whole thing was that he wanted to avoid a civil war. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  to build a country in which everyone could coexist alongside each other. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=516.46s)]
*  So you had this transition where the idea was that you sort of allow everyone to have [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=521.74s)]
*  their own piece of society. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=527.6600000000001s)]
*  Now from the beginning, you had this great fear among white South Africans that things [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=529.5400000000001s)]
*  would go horribly wrong, that they would be hunted in the streets and that they would [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=535.46s)]
*  have to migrate, run out of the country and leave very quickly. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=539.4200000000001s)]
*  You did indeed have white South Africans who left the country, but there was no mass [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=545.22s)]
*  confiscation of white on land. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=550.82s)]
*  There was no mass firing of white people. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=552.62s)]
*  That never happened. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=556.02s)]
*  So how do these Afrikaners, who are largely being spared major dislocation and change, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=557.26s)]
*  how do they ever qualify as refugees in the eyes of the United States? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=565.38s)]
*  They seem like the exact opposite so far in the story of refugees. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=570.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think you have to look at what it's like to give a power, right? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=575.02s)]
*  So you have, yes, Mandela is framing it as building a nation together. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=579.1s)]
*  But part of that is having to do practical things in order to ensure that a population, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=583.94s)]
*  the black majority, had access to opportunities that they didn't have before. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=591.12s)]
*  So that meant looking at things like affirmative action to ensure that companies are hiring [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=595.26s)]
*  black people. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=600.78s)]
*  And then there was, of course, the issue of land. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=602.7800000000001s)]
*  And this is one in which the government tried to say to the white landowners who owned almost [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=605.5400000000001s)]
*  all of the land, hey, we'll pay you if you can give us some of that land so we can redistribute [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=613.0s)]
*  it to our black population, to people who've worked on the land and lived on the land for [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=619.34s)]
*  years but never got a chance to own it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=624.26s)]
*  So it was called a willing-buy-or-willing-seller program. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=626.58s)]
*  And how much do the Afrikaners end up being willing to sell the land? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=629.96s)]
*  There was a degree of selling, but not nearly as much as I think the government wanted. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=635.08s)]
*  And so you take that over time. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=640.6800000000001s)]
*  And what you see is that there's these flashpoints happening around land. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  And what are some of those flashpoints? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  In the mid to late 90s, shortly after the end of apartheid, you start to see this uptick [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=649.88s)]
*  in murders on farms. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  And this is where we really see the foundations of this argument that Afrikaners are a persecuted [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=660.3199999999999s)]
*  people. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  Seven murders in the last decade in a radius of 30 kilometres, and the killings continue. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=670.52s)]
*  In February, armed robbers stormed this farmhouse and opened fire. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=676.52s)]
*  They want our guns, they want our money, and they want our land. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  What you had was essentially a lot of violence in the country as a whole. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=684.5999999999999s)]
*  And as part of that violence, you had murders happening on farms. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  A lot of Black South Africans have felt that the pace of change, the pace of ownership [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=694.92s)]
*  of land has not changed quickly enough. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=698.64s)]
*  The white minority which took our land by force, you must say enough is enough. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=701.0s)]
*  We are taking the future into our own hands. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=708.28s)]
*  So there have been clashes over that, right? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=711.5s)]
*  It was here that three of Bill Voller's attackers grew up and lived. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=713.34s)]
*  It's a desperately poor community, dependent on the jobs provided by farmers. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=717.5s)]
*  You see things where there are communities around some of these farms where people who [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=722.86s)]
*  are still living in shacks and living in poor dwellings might just go and invade land. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=726.22s)]
*  They live in this squatter camp with hundreds of others who are jobless and landless. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=731.7s)]
*  Here criminals have become role models. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=737.02s)]
*  Automatically those things kind of become racialised, right? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=740.02s)]
*  They become seen as sort of a broader effort to target white people, to target white farm [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=742.94s)]
*  owners and to take the land from them. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=749.6600000000001s)]
*  They are left wondering at the motive for the attack. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=751.4200000000001s)]
*  Was it an opportunistic robbery or race-based violence? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=754.98s)]
*  We haven't done anything to anybody. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=759.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=761.58s)]
*  So you have this population that has just lost power and they'd already been thinking [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=767.14s)]
*  that the black majority was going to come after them at the end of apartheid. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=772.9399999999999s)]
*  But now you see this increase in violence on farms and it's just like for many Africanas, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=777.5s)]
*  their worst fear is coming true. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=782.8s)]
*  But I think it's important to note that the police statistics show that there is not and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=785.16s)]
*  has never been mass killings of white farmers. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=792.06s)]
*  In fact, the farm workers account for only a very tiny percentage of the overall killings [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=796.62s)]
*  in South Africa. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=802.62s)]
*  And on top of that, if you look at who is killed on farms, they tend to be farm workers [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=804.96s)]
*  or the people who are living there and those people tend to be black. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=811.3s)]
*  But even so, this fear had taken hold among Africanas. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=816.46s)]
*  And this is when we really start seeing their journey toward identifying as a persecuted [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=820.9s)]
*  people begin to play out. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=825.94s)]
*  And how does that get on the radar of Donald Trump? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=828.6600000000001s)]
*  So over many years, you had Africanas who were going around the world and lobbying. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=832.2600000000001s)]
*  They were writing reports, laying out their calculations of how many people were getting [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=842.0200000000001s)]
*  killed on farms. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=847.0200000000001s)]
*  They were creating lists of what they called, quote unquote, race laws, which are laws that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=848.7600000000001s)]
*  they felt were essentially discriminating against white people. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=853.22s)]
*  And they got that message around to as many people as they could. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=856.9399999999999s)]
*  And eventually they made their way to Washington, where in 2018, some prominent Afrikaner activists [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=861.46s)]
*  appeared on Tucker Carlson's show. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=870.06s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=872.62s)]
*  Traditionally, a pretty useful gateway to Donald Trump's brain. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=873.62s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=880.02s)]
*  We've got an exclusive investigation for you tonight. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=881.5s)]
*  The president of South Africa, Syro Ramaphosa, has begun. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=883.5s)]
*  Tucker Carlson essentially ran a segment saying Afrikaners are having their land taken, that [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=886.6999999999999s)]
*  they are victims of reverse discrimination. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=892.54s)]
*  I thought the whole point of the new South Africa and the reason the rest of us were [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=895.06s)]
*  excited to see it in 1994 take shape is because it rejected racial discrimination. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=898.62s)]
*  And yet the government is now embracing it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=905.3s)]
*  Or am I missing something? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=907.1s)]
*  And that they are the ones who are being persecuted. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=908.22s)]
*  How should the US administration respond to this human rights tragedy that we're watching unfold? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=911.46s)]
*  The administration needs to make it very clear that it is both immoral because it targets [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=918.4200000000001s)]
*  a specific group of people. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=922.78s)]
*  And I thought we were beyond that. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=924.26s)]
*  And sure enough, just hours after Tucker ran that program on his Fox News show, President [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=926.62s)]
*  Trump tweeted about Afrikaners. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=933.1600000000001s)]
*  And in his tweet, he said he was ordering the then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=936.3000000000001s)]
*  investigate the mass killings of Afrikaners and the seizure of their land. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=941.1s)]
*  So these were sort of the two big talking points that had formed the basis of Afrikaner [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=946.5s)]
*  lobbying to say we're a persecuted people that were getting killed on our land and were [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=953.38s)]
*  getting it taken away from us. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=957.5s)]
*  And now suddenly, the most powerful man in the world was endorsing those two theories. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=959.16s)]
*  And if you think about it, this is the perfect thing to capture Trump's eye. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=966.82s)]
*  Because if we look at his ascendancy to the presidency, part of his whole pitch was to [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=974.58s)]
*  be this president who would ensure that the forgotten white man would be taken care of, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=980.46s)]
*  right? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=988.02s)]
*  That we would fight back against sort of this demographic shift, these demographic changes, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=989.02s)]
*  these brown people coming into our country and invading our borders. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=994.02s)]
*  And so Trump's presidency and his whole political identity has always had an element that has [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=998.34s)]
*  really spoken to the folks all around the world who embrace these sort of theories, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1005.66s)]
*  these feelings that white people are under threat. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1011.42s)]
*  And so here he had an example. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1015.12s)]
*  The story of Africa could now be the example that he points to and says, like, this is [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1019.74s)]
*  what could come for us here in America. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1024.06s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1039.26s)]
*  John, once Donald Trump picks up on the story of the Afrikaners and once he begins to see [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1040.26s)]
*  them as a potential cautionary tale for white people in the United States, what does he [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1050.26s)]
*  end up doing about it? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1057.42s)]
*  Well, nothing happened in that first term, to be frank. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1059.3799999999999s)]
*  As was the case often in his first term, he had sort of the more savvy operators around [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1062.46s)]
*  him who were able to sort of rein in his impulses. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1065.9s)]
*  But as we know, he got back into office in 2025, started his second term. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1071.18s)]
*  And shortly after he came into office, the president of South Africa, he signed into [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1076.82s)]
*  law a bill that would essentially allow the government to take privately held land without [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1082.02s)]
*  providing compensation to the owners. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1089.14s)]
*  And as you can imagine, this a lot of Afrikaners see as a way that the government will directly [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1092.54s)]
*  be able to target their land and take it from them. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1098.26s)]
*  Now, in reality, the law is not that aggressive. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1101.26s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1104.98s)]
*  It's meant for the government to take land in the public interest. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1105.98s)]
*  So one government minister said it was akin to eminent domain in the US. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1111.18s)]
*  And most legal experts say that this would be very rare that they would take without [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1116.3400000000001s)]
*  compensation. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1121.18s)]
*  It would most likely be in cases where there's land just sitting there in disrepair, where [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1122.26s)]
*  the owner is not doing anything to take care of it. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1126.18s)]
*  The owners abandoned it and it's just, you know, lying fallow, right? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1127.98s)]
*  They'd say that's sort of the most sensible case in which it would happen and that this [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1132.58s)]
*  would not be something that would be used to go after Afrikaners and push them off their [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1136.54s)]
*  land and get black people land ownership. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1139.98s)]
*  But when Trump hears about this law, he talks about it in ways that don't have any of that nuance. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1143.9s)]
*  Terrible things are happening in South Africa. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1152.3s)]
*  He talks to reporters saying that in South Africa, they're doing terrible things. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1155.7s)]
*  They're taking away land, they're confiscating land, and actually they're doing things that [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1159.18s)]
*  are perhaps far worse than that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1164.1399999999999s)]
*  And those statements just really send the whole Trump orbit into overdrive against South [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1167.7s)]
*  Africa. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1173.1399999999999s)]
*  South Africa is a deeply corrupt, criminality-filled state. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1174.1399999999999s)]
*  The country seems to be falling apart. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1177.18s)]
*  And then President Trump in the past month has basically said the same thing. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1178.72s)]
*  And it's shocking to a lot of people, I think, how bad it is and how just how racist it is. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1182.9s)]
*  South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has had a chat with Elon Musk, the billionaire [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1188.46s)]
*  who was born and brought up there, accused South Africa of having openly racist ownership laws. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1193.0600000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk, who is one of Trump's close advisors, who is from South Africa, you have him posting [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1199.0600000000002s)]
*  on social media about this land law and then asking the government openly like, why do [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1204.6200000000001s)]
*  you have racist laws? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1209.5800000000002s)]
*  New Secretary of State Marco Rubio writing on X, South Africa is doing very bad things. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1211.42s)]
*  Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, turning down an invitation to go to a G20 meeting [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1216.54s)]
*  in South Africa, you know, citing this law. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1221.1000000000001s)]
*  And then it ultimately sort of peaks in this moment in February. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1224.18s)]
*  An order slashing aid to South Africa and directing his administration to develop a [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1228.26s)]
*  plan for resettlement. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1232.76s)]
*  Where you had Trump issue an executive order that cut all aid that the US was giving to [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1234.02s)]
*  South Africa. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1240.3799999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1241.3799999999999s)]
*  And then he said he was offering refugee status to Afrikaners. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1242.3799999999999s)]
*  And he cites this land law as one of the reasons. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1247.5s)]
*  And in his executive order, he says that the land law, quote, follows countless government [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1250.06s)]
*  policies designed to dismantle equal opportunity in employment, education and business and [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1254.3s)]
*  hateful rhetoric and government actions fueling disproportionate violence against racially [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1259.86s)]
*  disfavored landowners. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  By which he means white Afrikaners. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1267.78s)]
*  They happen to be white. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1270.06s)]
*  But whether they're white or black makes no difference to me. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1271.02s)]
*  But white farmers are being brutally killed and their land is being confiscated in South [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1274.7s)]
*  Africa. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1280.7s)]
*  He also calls them the victims of, quote, unjust racial discrimination. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1281.7s)]
*  So what this does is essentially it opens up a pathway now for refugee status for someone [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1285.82s)]
*  to come to the US as refugees. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1291.82s)]
*  And in this case, it's specifically Afrikaners who can come to the US as refugees. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1293.34s)]
*  So after he signs this executive order, this effort to get Afrikaners in America, it proceeded [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1298.78s)]
*  with stunning speed. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1304.82s)]
*  Usually it takes years to get refugees into the US. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1305.98s)]
*  But three months after this executive order is issued, we have the first Afrikaner refugee [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1310.22s)]
*  status in the US. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1318.46s)]
*  And it's a very, very important step. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1320.18s)]
*  And it's a very important step. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1322.18s)]
*  After the executive order is issued, we have the first Afrikaner refugees, 59 of them, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1324.18s)]
*  lined up at the airport in Johannesburg, waiting to get on a flight to the US. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1331.74s)]
*  John, the inevitable question here would seem to be how much has this decision by the president [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1336.14s)]
*  and those around him truly been about the circumstances of Afrikaners in South Africa [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1342.22s)]
*  and the threat level against them? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1348.0600000000002s)]
*  Because of this land law, because of everything else we've been talking about, and how much [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1351.74s)]
*  has it been about circumstances within the United States, the perceived threat level [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1357.14s)]
*  against white citizens here? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1362.3s)]
*  In other words, is this about the tale of the Afrikaners or that cautionary tale that [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1365.18s)]
*  Trump and those around him feel it represents to white Americans? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1372.3s)]
*  Or is it both? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1378.34s)]
*  I think by most objective measures, the facts on the ground in South Africa do not match [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1381.5s)]
*  up with the way Trump has described the situation there for Afrikaners. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1388.9s)]
*  Obviously, there are cases, like we've said, where Afrikaners are killed. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1394.5s)]
*  And there is a sincere perception, I believe, among many Afrikaners I've spoken with, that [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1399.6200000000001s)]
*  they are targeted, that they are treated unfairly. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1405.66s)]
*  That is a sincere belief that I think a lot of them do have. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1408.62s)]
*  That said, when you look at Trump's attention to this issue, it seems very much motivated [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1412.1s)]
*  by domestic circumstances in America. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1419.02s)]
*  If you listen to people in Trump's orbit... [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1422.3799999999999s)]
*  We're required to pretend this isn't happening, but it is happening. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1425.06s)]
*  Everybody hates the whites and wants them to die. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1428.1399999999999s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1431.34s)]
*  There's a firm belief that South Africa represents sort of the worst nightmare for America. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1432.98s)]
*  DEI creates America into an open-air prison, that if you're white, you can never escape [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1438.54s)]
*  it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1443.58s)]
*  You have to constantly apologize. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1444.58s)]
*  And it's like, by the way, if you want to live in that type of country, go to South [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1445.58s)]
*  Africa. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1449.42s)]
*  Many of them will point to South Africa and say South Africa is the example of what America [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1450.42s)]
*  will become if we allow these diversity, equity, and inclusion policies to just run rampant. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1455.42s)]
*  To go down this immoral path will inevitably end you in a place where they're not yet arrived [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1462.34s)]
*  in South Africa, but they're well on their way. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1468.58s)]
*  And that path ultimately is a path of grotesque, genocidal violence. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1471.22s)]
*  So by targeting South Africa, Trump builds points with his base in the US, which very [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1477.4599999999998s)]
*  much frowns upon any sort of legal measure or any sort of initiatives that even have [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1486.26s)]
*  a whiff of trying to address racial injustice in a way that makes it seem like it's discriminating [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1492.14s)]
*  against white people. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1498.58s)]
*  I wonder if within the Trump administration, this feels akin to taking their domestic values, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1500.14s)]
*  which they have been very firm about. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1509.86s)]
*  Like you said, rolling back diversity initiatives across government and even the private sector [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1511.62s)]
*  and putting those now at the center of US foreign policy and saying if this is going [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1517.1799999999998s)]
*  to be central to how we treat domestic policy, this will be central to how we treat our relationships [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1525.58s)]
*  across the world. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1533.06s)]
*  The US government, Trump's administration has said that explicitly that they were cutting [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1534.86s)]
*  for programs that they believe further these issues of DEI, diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1539.3999999999999s)]
*  So undoubtedly what you're saying, Michael, is the case in terms of that they are sort [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1545.76s)]
*  of putting their own judgment and their own values on what they see is happening in South [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1551.0s)]
*  Africa. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1555.84s)]
*  And I'll also note, when you talk to South Africans, whether that be government officials [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1556.84s)]
*  or just some case of ordinary South Africans, that for them is what feels like a frustrating [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1560.8s)]
*  Even if you want to accept that in America, maybe some of these initiatives, these laws [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1566.0s)]
*  and policies don't stack up. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1572.84s)]
*  They're saying, look, we have our own unique history here, a history where most people [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1575.08s)]
*  still have a living memory of apartheid because it's only 31 years ago. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1579.04s)]
*  That legacy is so baked in here that we clearly have to do things to change that. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1583.24s)]
*  And that we also have a majority black population, an 80% black population that continues to [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1588.44s)]
*  struggle, that continues to suffer. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1593.12s)]
*  And so our context is a little bit different. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1594.7s)]
*  Because in reality, these are simply not analogous societies. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1597.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1601.3400000000001s)]
*  For a lot of black South Africans to see Afrikaners being labeled as the persecuted people in their [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1602.3400000000001s)]
*  society, it just is shocking and flies in the face of their reality as they describe [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1609.74s)]
*  it. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1615.1000000000001s)]
*  A lot of black South Africans will say, you know, life here continues to be very difficult. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1616.1000000000001s)]
*  Unemployment is very high. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1621.46s)]
*  Crime is really bad. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1624.9s)]
*  When people do find jobs, you know, the wages aren't very good. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1626.64s)]
*  They don't have stable housing. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1629.88s)]
*  So the truth is a lot of black South Africans, if they had a chance to go to the US as refugees, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1631.22s)]
*  they probably would love to take up that offer. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1636.6000000000001s)]
*  But there is no such offer. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1639.06s)]
*  But there is no such offer. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1640.52s)]
*  And I think a lot of black South Africans, they feel that for the Trump administration, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1642.02s)]
*  This is not about how much someone is suffering, but it's about the type of person they want [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1646.92s)]
*  in their country. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1651.6000000000001s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6ETTPv6TMQ&t=1652.6000000000001s)]
