# The Alarming Findings Inside a Mass Shooterâ€™s Brain
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHLHB-di0wM)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  A mass shooting last fall by an Army reservist in Maine prompted my colleague, Dave Phillips,
*  to search for answers about whether the soldier's service could have been a factor.
*  Today the surprising answer Dave found, and how it may change our understanding of the
*  effects of modern warfare on the human brain.
*  It's Wednesday, March 13th.
*  So Dave, you've been working on a series of stories on injuries to soldiers in the
*  U.S. military.
*  And last week there was kind of a sudden and unexpected discovery related to that reporting
*  you've been doing.
*  Tell me about it.
*  So what I've been looking into for a couple of months was the idea that soldiers can be
*  injured just by firing their own weapons, by standing next to the blast of a mortar
*  or launching a rocket from a shoulder fire rocket launcher.
*  Some of these big heavy weapons, the blast wave is strong enough to really injure their
*  brains.
*  And I've been working on that over a couple of months because it's very new and there's
*  a lot of uncertain stuff.
*  And I was still working on it in October when I got a call from the New York Times
*  national desk and they said, hey, there's been a mass shooting in Maine.
*  We need your help.
*  The suspect was in the military.
*  So I dropped everything and got on it.
*  Right, because you're the guy who covers military affairs.
*  So they call you.
*  Right.
*  And the situation was that there's a 40 year old man in Maine named Robert Card.
*  been a sergeant first class in the army reserves for almost 20 years.
*  And he killed several people in a small town in Maine, Lewiston, in a restaurant and in
*  a bowling alley.
*  Then he goes on the lam and the whole region is in lockdown for two days.
*  And after a massive manhunt, they eventually find his body 15 minutes away from the shooting
*  site.
*  He had shot himself in the head.
*  In the aftermath, his family said that he had been hearing voices started right after
*  he had gotten some hearing aids last spring.
*  And he grew to have these nearly constant paranoid delusions that people at the supermarket,
*  people on the street, even people in his own family were saying terrible things about him,
*  essentially saying that he was a pedophile.
*  And he grew obsessed with these delusions that just simply were not happening.
*  The army saw this and they tried to intervene.
*  And in fact, he was actually hospitalized for two weeks by the army.
*  But ultimately it was not enough.
*  And he committed these shootings, which killed 18 people.
*  And so whenever any veteran is involved in any crime, our first move is generally to
*  ask the Pentagon for that person's background.
*  We want to know, is there anything in their military record that can help us understand
*  the present by looking at their military past?
*  And so did you find anything in this main shooter's military records?
*  In the case of Robert Card, the answer is really no.
*  You know, remember, we've been at war for more than 20 years and more than a million
*  people have deployed, many of them multiple times.
*  He had been in the military that whole time.
*  He had never deployed.
*  Never in Iraq or Afghanistan?
*  Never in Iraq or Afghanistan.
*  Never even in Germany or Korea.
*  And he also had a really humdrum job.
*  The official title for it was petroleum supply specialist.
*  What does that mean?
*  Essentially, you're the gas guy who makes sure that the tanks and the humvees and everything
*  else has enough fuel to run.
*  Pretty dull.
*  And so there was nothing at all in his service that suggested it had anything to do with
*  what had happened.
*  So at this point, you're like, OK, nothing to see here.
*  This mass shooting is probably totally unrelated to his time in the military because he never
*  deployed, right?
*  Well not quite.
*  I actually picked up one thing that I thought might be really tied to this and potentially
*  extremely important, and that was his hearing aids.
*  What was it about his hearing aids?
*  Well here's a guy who's 40 years old, a young fit guy who has hearing aids.
*  I would expect that from somebody who worked around artillery cannons or worked around
*  mortars, worked around tanks.
*  In the military, you see it all the time.
*  But this guy didn't seem to have any of that.
*  He's like a petroleum supply guy.
*  And so I was thinking, OK, something here doesn't make sense.
*  And I was able to track down some people who'd actually served next to Robert Card in his
*  platoon.
*  And they said, yes, he had been a petroleum supply specialist years ago.
*  But in 2014, he switched over to a training battalion where he was exposed to lots and
*  lots of blasts.
*  And basically what this battalion did is every summer, they held a summer camp for cadets
*  at West Point that taught them how to use all sorts of weapons, taught them how to use
*  machine guns, grenade launchers, shoulder-fired rockets, and hand grenades.
*  And that's where Robert Card worked, I learned.
*  Every year in the summer, he was on the hand grenade range where about 1,200 cadets would
*  come through, and most of them threw two grenades.
*  So every year, he's getting exposed in the course of a few weeks to 2,000 grenade blasts.
*  Now according to the military, this is safe.
*  This is fine.
*  No problem.
*  Move along.
*  But emerging research, like the stuff that I've been reporting about in the previous
*  shown that this repetitive blast from firing your own weapons can be really damaging.
*  And so I thought, okay, Robert Card was exposed to a lot of blasts.
*  Maybe that could help explain what happened to him.
*  So what did you do next?
*  Like, how do you start to answer that question?
*  Well, we knew that the answer would be in Robert Card's brain, that if he did have
*  a brain injury from repeated blast exposure, you can see it.
*  And what I learned soon after was that the main state medical examiner knew that too.
*  And in fact, after he died, they had saved his brain and then shipped it to Boston, where
*  one of the best brain labs that looks at traumatic brain injury is at Boston University.
*  These folks specialize specifically in documenting CTE in football players and other contact
*  athletes.
*  So Dave, is the thinking here that maybe Robert Card had something like CTE, that it's that
*  kind of injuries like we see in football players?
*  Well, they didn't know.
*  And the only way to figure it out was to essentially slice his brain into slices that are about
*  the 10th of a thickness of a piece of paper.
*  And then they look at it under two microscopes, a normal optical microscope and a really detailed
*  electron microscope that can look at things on a subcellular level.
*  And in the first microscope, they're looking for CTE, which is easy to see.
*  They can stain it brown and it creates these floral patterns around blood vessels in the
*  brain.
*  But when they looked at it, they didn't find that.
*  And if you're just exposed to blast, maybe that's not a big surprise because the research
*  suggests that blast exposure leads to something else, something that really doesn't have an
*  accepted name yet.
*  But in a sense is damage to the wiring that's deep in the brain.
*  And under the second microscope, that's essentially what they found in Robert Card's brain.
*  And what they're looking at is sort of the cables in the brain.
*  So your brain has outside of the brain, gray matter, which is where thoughts happen.
*  And inside the brain is white matter that is essentially wiring that connects all that
*  gray matter together.
*  So it can talk to itself, it can understand itself, it can act.
*  But it turns out that when blast waves surge through the brain, those long stringy pieces
*  of white matter essentially get whipped really hard, hard enough that they get frayed or
*  broken.
*  Think of it like the cable you use to charge your iPhone.
*  You can twist that and twist it up and untwist it and it'll be fine.
*  But it's the repetitive over and over that causes problems.
*  So imagine twisting your iPhone cable 10,000 times and then it might still be there, but
*  you plug it in and it doesn't work anymore.
*  And so that's what they're looking at in Robert Card's brain.
*  The results were definitive.
*  Despite never having served in combat, Card really suffered pretty severe brain damage
*  from these repetitive blasts at this training camp, it seems like.
*  Right.
*  And we have to be careful because we can't definitively say with Robert Card right now
*  that not only those grenade blasts caused this injury, but that that injury caused his behavior.
*  What we can say is that it's a very, very good match.
*  It certainly seems that that's the case.
*  And Dave, what is the implication of this?
*  Well, this is something that means so much more than just what happened to Robert Card
*  or what happened in a shooting in Maine.
*  And that's because for years, the military has known that blasts from combat, from roadside
*  bombs, from enemy attacks are dangerous and they can damage the brain.
*  But they haven't known what the effect of training is because most of the people who
*  served in the military also went overseas.
*  They might have gotten hit by an IED.
*  They might have experienced something traumatic in combat.
*  And so if they come back with brain injuries, it's very hard to say, are those brain injuries
*  tied to firing their own weapons?
*  Robert Card's almost like a control study.
*  We know that he never went overseas.
*  He also never played football in high school.
*  He was never in a serious car accident.
*  He didn't do a lot of things that could have caused a brain injury to him.
*  As far as we know, the only thing that could have damaged his brain is this blast injury
*  of working on the grenade range.
*  And so if that is true, that means that a lot of the brain injury that is happening
*  in the military is being caused by the military.
*  That's a big deal.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Dave, what exactly did the military know about brain damage caused by blasts?
*  And when did it know it?
*  Well, it starts with the IED problem.
*  During the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan around 2005, 2006, if you remember,
*  roadside bombs were the leading way that insurgents were hurting American forces.
*  And so the United States poured a ton of money into trying to understand, okay, these blasts
*  that these guys are experiencing, these men and women, they appear fine.
*  They get up and walk away, but there's something going on there.
*  It's not like you're missing a limb or something.
*  So when someone walks by, you may look absolutely normal, but it's a very invisible wound.
*  The military started gathering these stories and even shared some of these interviews.
*  When I came home, I was not the same person.
*  And when I got out, I didn't think that I had any issues or mental health issues that
*  would affect me in the civilian life.
*  I found that I was having trouble controlling my emotions sometimes, my anger.
*  Soldiers were coming home complaining to military leaders of all sorts of problems, you know,
*  feeling different, acting different, thinking different.
*  I ended up losing the job because I was getting violent.
*  Started another job, was getting violent there, was real irritable, hard to deal with.
*  So I was self-medicating, trying to hide, you know, feelings and things like that.
*  You know, I had the suicidal thoughts.
*  They were almost coming back as different people.
*  And the Defense Department poured hundreds of millions of dollars into this, starting
*  probably around 2008, trying to answer the question of what kind of blast is dangerous
*  and why.
*  And they started getting answers, but it was still really murky.
*  And so in 2012, they set up a brain bank to essentially collect brains from anyone and
*  everyone they could get who was in uniform, because this injury couldn't be seen through
*  an MRI, through a PET scan, through the normal things that we think of for imaging the brain.
*  It was too subtle, but you could slice it up and see it in the brain.
*  And what they were seeing was this telltale scarring in the white matter.
*  And at the same time, there were a lot of families that got results back from this brain
*  bank and saw that characteristic scarring in the white matter.
*  And they knew that their loved ones had been affected by blast.
*  And they also knew that enemy blasts were only a small fraction of what their loved
*  one experienced.
*  And so how could you untangle what was training caused and what was caused by the enemy?
*  And so a lot of these families, they started taking this information to Congress.
*  In 2018, they said to Congress, the military is not taking blasts seriously enough.
*  They don't understand it.
*  They can't tell who's injured.
*  They need to do something.
*  Congress at that point passed a law forcing the military to look at this research and
*  figure out how we can track this.
*  But here we are in 2024, and a lot of those questions are still not answered.
*  And then, of course, came CARD, right?
*  Which seems to give us something of a new data point, a new answer.
*  That's right, because the military, for all of this time, they had kind of been saying,
*  well, this is complicated.
*  We did some studies, but we still don't have clear answers.
*  And they would hem and haw and essentially use the lack of a definitive answer as a way
*  to postpone action.
*  But here's Robert CARD, and he's really important because the only thing he's been exposed to
*  is grenade blasts.
*  And that's supposed to be safe.
*  You know, something did happen after all those years of research.
*  The military, they finally put in place a safety threshold that basically said, above
*  this power of blast, there could be hazard.
*  And they use a number for that.
*  They measure blast in four pounds per square inch.
*  That's the strength of the blast wave hitting anybody.
*  But you can think of that four as a safety level.
*  Anything higher, probably dangerous.
*  Anything lower, supposed to be safe.
*  And that's why CARD is so important, because if he was only exposed to grenades and he
*  has a blast injury, those grenades come in not at four, not even at 3.9, they come in
*  at like one PSI or maybe one and a half.
*  So that suggests that this safety threshold that got put in place is way off.
*  And that's really important, not just for Robert CARD, but for all sorts of troops who
*  are training right now, because there are many weapons out there, mortars, shoulder
*  fired rocket launchers, big artillery that come in at higher levels.
*  Some of them as high as eight or nine PSI.
*  And what that threshold doesn't take into account is that we're not just talking about
*  one blast.
*  We're talking about hundreds or thousands of blasts.
*  And how does that change how any blast is a threat or a hazard?
*  So essentially all of this study and research didn't actually translate into procedures
*  that kept soldiers safer.
*  Right.
*  You know, it's sometimes frustrating for me to see this research because there are brilliant
*  people who are building computer models that model how energy waves go through brain matter
*  or they are very carefully blowing up lab rats and then cutting open their brains to
*  see the effects.
*  None of that expensive and time consuming research has any difference to the people
*  in uniform.
*  Dave, how many vets are we talking about here?
*  I mean, how many people may be suffering or at risk of this kind of brain damage?
*  Do we know the scale here?
*  That's a really hard question to answer.
*  We know that more than 450,000 people have been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury
*  by the military since 2000.
*  But that probably leaves out tens of thousands of people who, like Robert Card, were exposed
*  to repeated blasts and may have a brain injury but never were diagnosed.
*  So the universe is potentially very large.
*  That's why this is such a huge deal.
*  Dave, stepping back for a second, you know, it seems like what we're learning here through
*  this example of Robert Card is kind of bringing us into a moment where we're sort of rethinking
*  what it means to have combat trauma, right?
*  Like that it might actually have a lot more to do with the physical blast than with the
*  mental or psychological trauma that one goes through in, say, a combat deployment.
*  One thing that I've been reporting about for years is when soldiers come home different
*  and why.
*  You know, and I started out really focusing on post-traumatic stress disorder and just
*  the horror of war and how that can change and erode your character.
*  And then I learned that traumatic brain injury can be a big part of that and that those two
*  things may be tangled together in ways that are impossible to unravel.
*  What's really interesting about Robert Card and other people I've talked to who've never
*  deployed but they've been around a lot of blast is if you sent them into a typical army
*  clinic and had them list their symptoms, they would probably get diagnosed with PTSD.
*  They're sleepless.
*  They have anxiety.
*  They have panic attacks.
*  They are socially withdrawn.
*  They're depressed.
*  So there are all these things that we have long thought are products of war, of combat,
*  that may actually be an underlying condition that is not related to war at all.
*  You know, to put it in the plainest terms possible, it's basically related to a workplace
*  safety issue that we haven't acknowledged or addressed.
*  So when Johnny comes home different from the war, it might not actually be the war.
*  It might not actually be the war.
*  But I also think that there's a broader implication beyond the military.
*  And we can see it in Robert Card, right?
*  You know, here was a man whose blast injury wasn't understood, who did something horrendous.
*  And so I think we have to think about what is the cost of not doing anything here?
*  Now, of course, we don't know for sure that Robert Card did this because of his blast
*  injury, but we do know that he had profound injuries deep in his brain.
*  And we also know from talking to people that he served with that it's not just Robert Card.
*  Other people that served with him on the grenade range are also struggling.
*  You know, a number of them are getting help for pretty persistent mental health problems.
*  And one of his best friends was just recently hospitalized for a psychiatric crisis, and
*  he's now facing a domestic violence charge.
*  So how do we look at those people differently now after seeing Card?
*  How do we look at this problem in a way that tries to prevent that from happening?
*  Dave, I'm curious if you've heard from the family of Robert Card since this diagnosis.
*  And I wonder what this diagnosis has meant to them, if anything.
*  Well they didn't get a choice when his brain went to the lab.
*  That was the decision of the state, which really wanted to understand in whatever way
*  it could what had happened.
*  But when they got these results back and the family sat around their kitchen table listening
*  to the doctor who had looked into his brain and learned there was damage in a way that
*  I think was really surprising to them, it allowed them to have some forgiveness.
*  To not see their brother, their son, as a monster, but to see him as somebody who was
*  hurt.
*  Kind of gives them a different story about their brother.
*  Absolutely.
*  Dave, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  My assessment in the report about the relevance of the president's memory was necessary and
*  accurate and fair.
*  On Tuesday, in a tense appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, former Special
*  Counsel Robert Herr testified about his investigation and February report into President Biden's
*  handling of classified documents.
*  The four-hour session quickly descended into a brutal partisan fight.
*  In his report, Herr had called Biden, quote, an elderly man with a poor memory, a conclusion
*  that had infuriated Democrats.
*  Republicans, for their part, grilled Herr about his conclusion that the evidence was
*  insufficient to charge Biden with a crime.
*  Like, here's what I see.
*  Biden and Trump should have been treated equally.
*  They weren't.
*  And that is the double standard that I think a lot of Americans are concerned about.
*  And accused Herr of protecting Biden.
*  You exonerated them.
*  I know that the term willful retention has a...
*  Mr. Herr, it's my time.
*  But Herr made clear during the testimony that his report had not cleared Biden of wrongdoing,
*  rejecting a suggestion by Democrats that it had.
