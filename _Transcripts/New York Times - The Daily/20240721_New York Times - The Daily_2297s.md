# Sunday Special The 100 Best Books of the Century (So Far)
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDxdEHvcnZ8)
*  Hi everyone, it's Sabrina.
*  We're taking a break from our usual weekend routine to bring you something special today.
*  It's summer.
*  It's beach reading time.
*  Maybe you need a book to take a break from the news.
*  Anyway, our wonderful colleagues at the New York Times Book Review recently compiled a
*  list of the 100 best books of the 21st century so far.
*  To be clear, this is not a list of bestsellers.
*  Or just literary award winners.
*  I mean, there's some of those.
*  But to make their list, they surveyed more than 500 novelists, poets, critics, editors,
*  and readers.
*  It's a very cool project.
*  And it's a super interesting list.
*  It's gotten a huge response.
*  And so today, we're sending you the episode of their podcast.
*  It's an episode about this list and what's on it.
*  You should also know that beyond this episode, the New York Times Book Review's podcast
*  comes out regularly.
*  They have fascinating conversations all the time, including with some of the phenomenal
*  writers on this recent list.
*  So sign up for their show wherever you listen to us.
*  OK, here they are.
*  I'm Gilbert Cruz, editor of the New York Times Book Review, and this is the Book Review Podcast.
*  On this week's episode, I'm very excited to finally talk about a project that we've
*  been working on for much of 2024, and which is finally out there in the world.
*  100 best books of the 21st century so far.
*  If you're listening to this show, if you're listening to a podcast about books, I have
*  to think you've already seen part or all of it.
*  Joining me this week are three editors who have been deep in the weeds with me on this
*  since January.
*  Tina Jordan, hello.
*  Hi.
*  Ju Monica T, welcome back.
*  Hi, Gilbert.
*  And Scott Heller, this is your first time on the show.
*  It is.
*  I'm a listener now.
*  I'm excited to be here.
*  Thanks.
*  I'm excited to have all of you on.
*  So I'm hoping we can have a free flowing discussion about this effort, about some of the books
*  on the list, books that didn't make the list.
*  There's a lot to dig into here.
*  And I want to start by asking someone else who's not me, Tina, why did we do this?
*  Why did we do this?
*  Because we looked around and we, it was almost the quarter century mark.
*  We're book nerds who like to categorize and make lists.
*  And we thought, what are the best books of the 21st century so far?
*  And we started to argue about it.
*  We started to talk ourselves about the things we'd read since January 1st, 2000 that we
*  loved.
*  And then we thought, hey, maybe there's something here.
*  But let's put this out to a lot of people.
*  Because normally we would have just done this in-house.
*  We would have pulled the editors, pulled the critics, our wonderful critics, and that would
*  have been it.
*  But this seemed like an opportunity to do something bigger.
*  Given that we ask all these writers all the time to write for us, to review books, to
*  appear in our pages.
*  We figured we could actually use their voices towards something massive.
*  And this thing is massive.
*  Scott is someone who's still relatively new to the desk, as new as I am.
*  We've only been here about two years.
*  What was the most surprising thing to you about this effort, this project?
*  What ended up being most surprising, actually, was how many people were willing to share
*  their ballots.
*  We bent over backwards to let people know this was anonymous.
*  And don't worry, we're not going to reveal who you pick, who you left off.
*  And yet so many people were willing to come forward with what they selected.
*  And I think that's one of the best things about it, in fact.
*  The aggregated list is wonderful on this planet to argue about.
*  But when you go get in and dig into what Stephen King put on his list, in fact, he put himself
*  on his list, which I think people have gotten a kick out of.
*  But many others came forward.
*  And I think that makes for a sort of wonderful reading in and of itself.
*  And also, you get to see a lot of quirky choices that maybe many people didn't vote for, but
*  that individuals are passionate about.
*  And I really enjoyed that.
*  Scott, I think you're right.
*  I think seeing some of the ballots possibly is more entertaining to some of our readers
*  than seeing the list itself.
*  I have to say, in our earliest discussions about this project, one of the things that
*  was an inspiration, certainly for me, was the Sight and Sound list.
*  For those of you who don't know, Sight and Sound is a British film journal.
*  And ever since 1952 or 1962, every 10 years, they've taken a poll of critics, and then
*  they turn into a poll of critics and film directors, and they ask them to put their
*  top films of all time.
*  And every 10 years, it's a big deal when this list runs, particularly over the past couple
*  decades, because not only do they run the list, but they run the ballots of the most
*  famous critics and the most famous directors.
*  You can see what Guillermo del Toro and Barry Jenkins and I don't know if Steven Spielberg
*  participated, but you can imagine all the people whose lists are on there and just get
*  a real sense of their taste.
*  And then the other thing that's interesting about this list is that it changes over time.
*  So Citizen Kane was the top movie for many decades, and then Vertigo was the top movie,
*  and now there's a French movie.
*  Jean Diehlmann, other French words I cannot pronounce, that is the top movie.
*  I'm not saying we're going to do this every 10 years, but it certainly is an inspiration
*  to try to capture a moment in time.
*  And whatever else you want to say about this list, it is a snapshot of this moment in time.
*  There are probably books on here.
*  If you took this poll at the end of this year would not be on here.
*  If you had taken it earlier, they would not be on here.
*  This is what people in the spring of 2024 that we polled thought were the 100 best books.
*  So let's talk about some of these books.
*  I'd love to start with our number one book, which I don't know, were people surprised?
*  Was anyone in this room at least surprised that My Brilliant Friend by Alina Ferrante
*  to our 503 respondents, the number one book of the 21st century?
*  I was surprised.
*  Okay.
*  But maybe I shouldn't have been because as a reminder to our listeners, we asked our
*  respondents to choose what they thought were the 10 best books of the century so far, but
*  we didn't define best for them.
*  And people clearly defined it in different ways.
*  They defined it as the book they loved that they pass along to people.
*  They defined it as the books they thought would still be around generations from now.
*  But it really seems to me that a lot of the people who took our poll were just like voting
*  for the books that had struck them, right?
*  The books they could not get out of their heads.
*  Absolutely.
*  And I think we're all going to touch on what books fell into our own personal categories
*  of books we couldn't get out of our head.
*  Talk a little bit more about Ferrante.
*  Thankfully, luckily, we have a Ferrante expert on here.
*  Apparently, there are several Ferrante experts on the desk, but we have one who is in studio
*  who wrote a wonderful article that published in conjunction with this project looking at
*  all the theories about who Alina Ferrante is.
*  Alina Ferrante is an author who uses an alias.
*  We don't really know who the author is.
*  There are theories and suspicions.
*  First, Jumana, I'd love for you to talk about just the book and maybe the Neapolitan court
*  as a whole.
*  Two of them appeared on this list.
*  There is, of course, some irony of being an expert on somebody that we don't even know
*  who it is, but I will lean into that with pride.
*  So Tina, I actually agree with you that I was surprised to see my brilliant friend first.
*  I do think it's a nice representation of a couple things.
*  Obviously, this whole quartet touched people really deeply, but also I think we're all
*  still coming out of Ferrante fever.
*  Do you remember those years where everybody was reading these books?
*  It was an actual event when she had a new book coming out when the HBO adaptations were
*  on.
*  So I liked that this top pick represents a couple different ways of looking at what best
*  really means.
*  In case you are one of the people who has not been infected with Ferrante fever, my
*  brilliant friend is the first in a series of four books that is now known as the Neapolitan
*  quartet.
*  It follows a lifelong friendship between two girls who are growing up in Naples.
*  They're poor.
*  They're both fiercely intelligent.
*  They're both preternaturally smart and preternaturally attached to each other from the time that
*  they're young girls.
*  They are doubles of one another, and it's a very charged relationship.
*  There's jealousy, there's rivalry, but it's also built on a type of love that you only,
*  I think, can really foster when you're at that age and you attach on a friend like that.
*  I think I read this pretty much the first when it came out in English, so I followed
*  the course of all these novels as they were arriving.
*  And something that a lot of people were responding to, myself included, was that it was one of
*  the first times we had seen the complexities of a female friendship so substantively discussed.
*  There was so much recognition in it, and it was a pleasure.
*  And I think, too, so the series, if you stick with it, and I think you should, because personally
*  my favorite is not the first one, and I'm not going to tell you what my favorite is,
*  but that's an incentive to continue with the series.
*  We're going to get this out of you.
*  Maybe.
*  I'm a locked box, man.
*  Anyway, so you see the women grow up.
*  You see them throughout their entire lives, and you see how their lives intersect with
*  the history of Italy, with Naples, with all sexism and communism and labor movements,
*  and she does it very delicately.
*  And I guess as a last Easter egg, since I am the in-studio Ferrante expert, I would
*  not say I am an expert outside of this studio, is that a couple years ago I wanted to write
*  a piece about Ferrante's English translator, Anne Goldstein, who really helped elevate
*  Ferrante's profile outside of Italy.
*  And I talked to a bunch of people who knew Ferrante, because of course she was really
*  well loved in Italy before the Neapolitan Quartet.
*  So I talked with a lot of other translators, people who know a lot about Italian literature,
*  people who had actually auditioned to translate Ferrante into English and lost out to Anne.
*  And they said, as much as I love Ferrante in Italian, I think Anne makes them even better
*  in English.
*  Scott, have you read any of the Ferrante books?
*  I've read the first one, and now I'm going to have to admit that I haven't continued
*  with it.
*  So we're in the same boat.
*  You too.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I have to say I was completely charmed.
*  I love the two of them.
*  I love the fierceness of their friendship.
*  And I don't read series typically.
*  So that may be why I didn't continue, but that's my foible.
*  I'm struck by something you said, which is these books were a cultural moment and Ferrante
*  Fever was a thing.
*  And it was, and I was completely consumed by it.
*  But a lot of other books that we saw as cultural moments since 2000 aren't on this list.
*  So what sets it apart?
*  What made this one pop?
*  There's a lot of good books that people were seen carrying everywhere, whether it's Seabiscuit
*  or Gone Girl.
*  And I will fight you about Gone Girl.
*  It is a really good book that are not on this list.
*  I love Gone Girl, to be clear.
*  I don't love it enough to maybe vote for it, but I love it.
*  So that's a great question.
*  And I have some hypotheses.
*  I don't have a definitive answer.
*  One thing I will say is that I think people over the course of a series, and I understand
*  that there are people like you, Scott, who just don't, you know, life is short.
*  Why are you going to stick with four books?
*  For what it's worth, Ferrante herself considers all four of these books one long novel that
*  are basically serialized like Dickens.
*  I don't know if you've invested a thousand pages with these two people, they're going
*  to stick with you maybe more than a woman who the title will tell you is gone.
*  It's harder to be closer with that kind of person if she's absent.
*  That's my theory.
*  Is that how like TV creators like no, this is actually an 11 hour movie, which is not
*  at all annoying when they say that?
*  I mean, also everybody who doesn't want to visit it in one way or another.
*  True.
*  Although post war navels.
*  That is true.
*  I don't want to go in the meat factory.
*  So what were you surprised at, Tina, that was not on this list since you brought it
*  up?
*  Cultural moments?
*  No Gone Girl, no prep by Curtis Sittenfeld, no Seabiscuit by Laura Hillenbrand.
*  I didn't really expect to see Kevin Kwan on there, but that book was huge.
*  I just, I feel like the books that were when we were seeing people carry around books,
*  not that we do anymore, like so few of those ended up on the list.
*  Let me ask this question then not to mess with the conceit of our own list, but we talked
*  about how everyone defined best in a different way.
*  Is this, did people overemphasize the over literary, the ones that they think are fancy
*  are the ones they should pick as opposed to Gone Girl, which I put on my list.
*  All of us in this room took the poll.
*  We're not going to share our results with you.
*  We're not going to share our ballots, but I put Gone Girl on my list.
*  I think Gone Girl is a great book that is extremely well written that most people loved
*  at the time and I think will continue to be read.
*  I agree with you.
*  I do think people erred towards what they considered to be great.
*  I think there's less fun reading on this list than I thought there would be.
*  But what is a fun book on this list?
*  Who wants to pick a fun book on this list?
*  Pastoralia by George Saunders.
*  This is coming in at a cool 85.
*  I was delighted.
*  We want to have story collections on here.
*  Pastoralia is hysterical.
*  If you only read one thing in it, read Sea Oak, which is one of my favorite short stories
*  of all time.
*  So George Saunders had three books on here.
*  There are only three authors that had three books on here.
*  George Saunders with two story collections and his novel Lincoln and the Bardo.
*  Ferrante had two of her Neapolitan quartets and then The Days of Abandonment and Jesmyn
*  Ward had her memoir and two novels.
*  Just to hang one more beat on George Saunders.
*  Why is he good?
*  I'm not saying he's not.
*  Are we doing 11 hour series on George Saunders?
*  Because I can follow.
*  Sure, if you post.
*  In Pastoralia, you see his really bizarre bonkers laugh out loud funny.
*  He's a very emotional writer.
*  He doesn't stray away from things that seem difficult.
*  He takes on some big stuff.
*  I mean, Lincoln and the Bardo is one of the better books about grief that I've read in
*  a long time.
*  And long time listeners of this podcast know I love grief books, although not the Joan
*  Didion that's on here, but we can get to that later.
*  And I think he's able to render these what can often feel like oppressive, overwhelming
*  human experiences into things that are very manageable, like deceptively simple.
*  So I'm delighted he's on here.
*  Scott?
*  I think one thing we should remember is that we went to and got answers from a lot of writers
*  who teach in universities and probably many, many, many fiction writers are graduates of
*  MFA programs.
*  And George Saunders is an incredibly influential figure in that world.
*  And I bet a lot of I don't think this shape the answers, but plenty of his students are
*  among the most important writers of this generation and are on this list, in fact.
*  So I think he's at the center of taste making in some ways.
*  And I think, you know, I know what Tina and I and all of us had discussed as we were trying
*  to put together a wish list of who would actually vote is going beyond only sort of experts
*  in literary fiction.
*  And that I think is I think ultimately, I think it's literary fiction writers who ended
*  up answering the survey probably more than any others.
*  And that's why the list reflected their taste, I would say.
*  I don't know about that.
*  You don't think so?
*  Okay.
*  I think we asked more literary fiction writers than genre writers.
*  For sure.
*  There are quite a few genre writers.
*  And they still went fancy to use Gilbert's term.
*  You can see on the ballot that Scott referred to the page where you can see a bunch of writers
*  ballots you have Rebecca Roanhorse, you have Sarah McLean, some of these writers who really
*  within a genre and focus their their picks probably very deliberately on genre books
*  because they had a sense perhaps that those types of books would be underrepresented on
*  the list and they were.
*  We have one sci-fi fantasy one prominent sci-fi fantasy book on here, which is the fifth season
*  by N.K.
*  Jemisin, but certainly would have been great to have seen more.
*  I agree.
*  And that's what makes looking at their ballots so fabulous.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Welcome back.
*  This is the Book Review Podcast and I'm Gilbert Cruz.
*  I'm joined this week by three of my fellow editors at the Book Review, Tina Jordan,
*  Jumana Katibe and Scott Heller to talk about our 100 books of the 21st century project.
*  Jumana just mentioned how much she loves George Saunders, the short stories of George Saunders.
*  Are there any other books on this list that Scott or Tina you found particularly pleasurable?
*  If by pleasurable you mean laugh out loud funny, I'm going to nominate Alison Bechdel's
*  Fun Home.
*  Is that a laugh out loud?
*  Okay, maybe I have a morbid sense of humor.
*  This is a graphic memoir.
*  Yes, her family lived in a funeral home.
*  She's just funny.
*  You know how some writers you just whatever it is that they strike that cord in you.
*  I've never laughed so hard.
*  Okay, Scott.
*  All right, I would say going to the list number 16, the amazing adventures of Cavalier and
*  Michael Shabin's book about the history of the comic book industry is a complete delight.
*  It captures the making of culture, it captures the immigrant experience and it's just rich
*  and vivid.
*  It's a long book.
*  It's one of those big fat books that you lose yourself into it in and I felt like it could
*  have gone on.
*  I would I completely loved it.
*  And then actually the one right after that on the list is The Sellout by Paul Beatty,
*  which is a pretty impressive, pretty bold satire about race and racism.
*  And there's no question you'll smile and you'll laugh at both.
*  And The Sellout appeared on our critics list from earlier this year of the funniest book
*  since Catch-22.
*  Is that correct?
*  Yes, it did.
*  Yeah, the only crossover.
*  In fact, I think that might be.
*  Well, listeners, if you haven't checked out that list, please do find it.
*  We do more than lists here, but that is.
*  That's a great one as well.
*  One question that I've gotten a couple texts about shout out my friend Lenore is the break
*  between fiction and nonfiction.
*  We decided to do both categories in one list as opposed to doing two lists.
*  I think it was our estimation that maybe we had one shot at this and we could not we would
*  collapse if we actually had to do this effort twice.
*  There are, I believe, 26 nonfiction books on here.
*  So just over a quarter of the books are nonfiction.
*  What stood out to any of you in terms of the types of nonfiction books that our poll respondents
*  picked?
*  What stood out to me actually was the wide range.
*  We don't have that many of them.
*  Like you said, it's a quarter.
*  I think in real life that probably it may not exactly mirror book sales, but fiction
*  does greatly outsell nonfiction.
*  But of the nonfiction that appears, we have massive biographies like Caro's last volume
*  of LBJ.
*  We've got histories.
*  We've got memoirs.
*  We've got investigative reporting.
*  We even have true crime.
*  Like it's really a broad range.
*  Yes, we have the Frederick Douglass biography.
*  We have the Robert Caro fourth volume in his LBJ series, Say Nothing, Investigative.
*  Is that Investigative, True Crime?
*  It is.
*  Yeah.
*  A beloved book that placed very high on the list.
*  We have several memoirs.
*  Also, H is for Hawk.
*  H is for Hawk, Annie Erno.
*  The ones that are on here, I feel like the right ones.
*  Random Family, the Adrienne Nicole LeBlanc book that came out in 2001?
*  2003.
*  2003.
*  It was on my list.
*  I was very happy to see it here.
*  Yeah.
*  I feared that some of those early century books, to be honest, would get lost.
*  And they did.
*  That book clearly has resonated with anyone who's read it.
*  I thought no one is still going to be thinking about this book but me.
*  And so then when I saw it on the list, I was happy.
*  What else is from 2003 is fiction that's in the top 10.
*  The Known World by Edward P. Jones, also 2003.
*  As is The Corrections from 2001, which is a book that, look, I know Jonathan Frenz has
*  never heard of a podcast and he's certainly not listening to this one.
*  I was so curious as to where this book would place on the list because as the whole controversy
*  of when it came out and this feeling that it started the century, it came out a year
*  after Cavalier and Clay, I believe, and would people remember it?
*  And I will tell you they did because number five is, as they say, nothing is significant.
*  And we had gone into this whole process a little bit worried that people would only
*  be thinking about more recent books.
*  But in fact, for the most part, the last few years aren't really well represented here
*  at all.
*  No, although I think the ones and I'd love to hear other people's opinions on this because
*  there is there's a slight recency bias.
*  You'll see.
*  I wonder if Demon Copperhead, Trust, Tomorrow and Tomorrow, there might be one or two others
*  from the past two years if we took this in a year, if those would be if those would still
*  be on all great books, to be clear.
*  I'm not suggesting that any of them are not.
*  I'm just curious as to what are the books from the past few years that have stuck in
*  people's minds.
*  And clearly, two of those books are Pulitzer Prize winners.
*  One of them is one of the biggest bestsellers of the past couple of years and they have
*  lasted.
*  True.
*  My point was, you're talking about five books here.
*  And we went into this thinking, oh, no, what if most of the books on the list are from
*  the last seven or eight years?
*  And that just did not happen.
*  Jumana, you were going to talk about the Nobel winner?
*  Yeah, I was going to talk about Septology because that to me and I say that as a fan
*  of the half of one of the seven books of this book, I wonder if he hadn't received the
*  Nobel last year, if it would be as high on the list as it would be, although I'm delighted
*  to see it.
*  One thing I was worried about, because these are the things that keep me up at night, is
*  what kind of international representation we would see, what kind of translated literature
*  we would see.
*  You mentioned the years by Annie Ernaud.
*  I'm going to quibble with you about whether that's nonfiction, but that's a whole other
*  podcast.
*  What's what?
*  Just give me a little taste of the quibble.
*  I say this as somebody who is so deep in the Ernaud weeds that fine, but she coined her
*  own sociological term for her literary project.
*  It's not quite autobiography and it's not quite fiction, but out in the middle somewhere
*  they meet.
*  I'm dealing in blunt categories here.
*  We have nonfiction.
*  I'm sorry, nuance is not so good for a podcast.
*  We do not deal in nuance on this podcast.
*  This is the guy who sits around the horn like we're on ESPN.
*  You're right, I forgot about the horn.
*  Okay, forget it.
*  It is nonfiction.
*  Okay.
*  So in addition to the French writers and of course Bolaigne is on here, which was exciting
*  to me.
*  We even had Tova Dillivson who wrote the Copenhagen trilogy, which is a book that has stuck with
*  me and a lot of my friends kind of came as a total shock out of left field.
*  We named it as one of our 10 best couple years ago.
*  So it's just, it's nice to see a really good representation from across the world.
*  Persepolis, the vegetarian, it's good.
*  I'm sleeping better.
*  So one thing that I was maybe not surprised to see given the, what some interpret as the
*  state of the world over the past couple of decades was several dystopian novels on here.
*  There are ones that are incredibly dark like Kermak McCarthy's The Road, which is about
*  a father and son on the road.
*  They're in a burned out post nuclear war America and they're trying to survive and there are
*  cannibals and it's just grim even though he tries to leave you with a flicker of hope
*  at the end.
*  So you have something like that.
*  There was Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel.
*  This is a book that became very popular during the early days of the pandemic because it
*  was about a super flu that took out most of the world, had an amazing HBO adaptation.
*  This unlike The Road is a book that leaves you feeling a little bit hopeful.
*  A big part of the book is about a troupe of actors sort of walking around one of the Great
*  Lakes bringing the last flickers of civilization, Shakespeare, to all the groups of people that
*  they run into.
*  And while again, most people in the world died and they're very sad parts of the book,
*  it's also about the persistence of art, how we use art to remind ourselves that we're
*  human, how we use art to remind ourselves that in the darkest of times there is beauty
*  in the world.
*  Station Eleven is just a great book.
*  And then there is Never Let Me Go, which I think I characterize it recently as the quietest
*  dystopian novel that might ever exist.
*  Most of it is about a bunch of kids at an English boarding school.
*  I'm not going to ruin what the book is actually about.
*  But once you discover what is actually happening to the kids in this boarding school, where
*  they're living their little quotidian lives and just running having little arguments and
*  sniping at each other, it becomes crushingly sad.
*  I don't know.
*  The 21st century.
*  Has it been so sad that we care about dystopian novels more than ever?
*  Dystopia for summer.
*  No, this is part of the firmament of most good literature.
*  It's never that far out of reach for the good writers.
*  Do I think, I don't know, do we need some benzos collectively?
*  Maybe.
*  I'm not a doctor.
*  I don't know.
*  Scott, what do you think?
*  I actually would have thought that there would be more bleak stuff on the list.
*  In fact, sorry to say.
*  Yeah.
*  I really did.
*  I did.
*  I thought the road would be higher.
*  In fact, I don't know how you judge whether a book, how high it's ranked is how miserable
*  people feel about the world.
*  It's a direct connection, Scott.
*  Yeah, there is.
*  Okay.
*  And I had a conversation with the critics and we talked about whether this list and
*  how this list speaks to the shadow of 9-11 and what the 21st century has been about.
*  And I think the agreement was it felt like people were picking books that took them away
*  from the state of the world more than took them closer to.
*  And I kind of agree with that actually.
*  In terms of directly stuff that's directly connected to the political situation, we have
*  The Looming Tower.
*  The Lawrence Wright book was very specifically about 9-11 and its aftermath.
*  But it's really only around the edges and in many ways not even around the edges.
*  There's quite a number of historical novels on this list, which of course are still maybe
*  about contemporary America in all sorts of ways, especially the novels that are about
*  race and slavery inevitably are still about now.
*  They're not just about then.
*  But there's something about this facet of the 21st century that I found there to be
*  not as much as I expected.
*  I do agree with that, especially because for the first half of the time period we're talking
*  about it was also what consumed the young adult literary landscape, right?
*  Like Hunger Games.
*  Hunger Games.
*  All those books.
*  That's all there was.
*  The other thing I was really interested going in and I'm still trying to figure out is this
*  is a list of books that were all produced in the digital first era for the most part.
*  And do we feel like these are books that live in the shadow of the internet that are made
*  by and for people who don't have the attention spans to read and are actually, as we all
*  are, listening to books and not just reading books, which is increasingly part of the way
*  people are consuming.
*  I was interested in getting into that with the critics and I think the critics had some
*  interesting answers, but I'm curious what people here think.
*  First of all, Scott, I think listening to a book is reading a book.
*  Thank you.
*  Okay, I hear you.
*  One thing you mentioned does remind me just how popular historical fiction and historical
*  fiction I feel like is possibly on the edge of being too broad a category at this point
*  if the 80s are starting to be historical fiction, but how popular historical fiction is as a
*  category as a genre and how well represented it is on our list from Wolf Hall to The Known
*  World to The Underground Railroad to Pachinko to Lincoln and the Bardo.
*  Well, I mean, those arguably are all pieces of historical fiction and I think if you go
*  down the list of 100 here, you probably have a 40% or something like that.
*  I agree with you.
*  So, you know, actually, Scott, your point about to what extent the internet has influenced
*  this list, maybe it's that it drove people in the other direction, like at the same time
*  when we're talking about the tech boom and barreling towards relentless progress at what
*  cost people are being driven to historical fiction as a means of escape.
*  That I could think that I'm willing to stand behind that.
*  We have a theory.
*  Look, it also makes big fat novels more pleasurable to be sinking into an old fashioned narrative
*  and there's many of them on this list, I think is a pleasure of this moment because
*  we're receiving information in bits and fragments so much and to sustain a real story is a pleasure.
*  So as we draw to a close here, I'm curious, I'd love to go around again and just ask
*  each of you to stump for a book that did not appear on the list, but you are particularly
*  passionate about.
*  Scott?
*  We were talking about funny before and one of the funniest books that was on the other
*  list and I wish was on this one is Then We Came to the End by Joshua Farris, which I
*  think is one of the absolute funniest workplace comedies ever and wherever you work, you're
*  gonna laugh.
*  Then you may cry a little bit too, but I think that's one that I really do think was on
*  my ballot and I wish was made it onto the full list and the other one that was on my
*  ballot and that's singular and there's not that many of us who would have gone for it,
*  but I had been the theater editor for a long time and the best theater books that have
*  come out during this period are these two books of Stephen Sondheim's lyrics called
*  Finishing the Hat and Look I Made a Hat and the more people are embracing Sondheim and
*  the more people are gonna start looking back at these books and realize that he's an amazing
*  writer, lyricist, and an amazing critic of his own work and you're introduced to his
*  thought processes as he wrote some of the greatest songs in theater history and they're
*  incredible books.
*  Scott, I love those books.
*  There's the one's sort of a bright pink cover, one's a bright blue cover.
*  That's right.
*  It's his lyrics.
*  There's photos from the original productions.
*  Those are absolutely wonderful.
*  A good gift for anyone or for yourself.
*  Thank you.
*  Jumana.
*  So I love Dana Spiotta, colleague of George Saunders.
*  I voted for one of her books.
*  I think she's just incredible book to book to book.
*  I would have liked to see Eat the Document on here.
*  This is from 2006.
*  It is about sort of 1970s activists.
*  There's a Bob Dylan reference.
*  I love her.
*  I wish I'd seen her, but Dana, you're on my list.
*  Tina, what would you have liked to have seen on here?
*  I would have loved to have seen a novel called The Paying Guests by Sarah Waters, which I
*  think is probably my favorite book of the century so far.
*  Good kick, Tina.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah.
*  In Britain in the 1920s, when things were post-war years, when things were especially
*  grim.
*  That's a Tina special.
*  Yeah, right.
*  A young woman and her mother are taking in a lodger to help them make ends meet.
*  And the lodger they take in, her name is Lillian, she and the daughter, Frances, fall in love.
*  But it's set against the backdrop of a murder, which I can't get into.
*  There are individual scenes of such power in this book that I'll never get out of my
*  head.
*  There's one scene where someone is being given a shave with a straight razor, and you're
*  certain it's going to end in that person's death.
*  And you're reading, and you're just sweating because the tension is dialed so high.
*  I don't know if you experienced it like that, Jumana, but just highs and lows, but just
*  an incredible story.
*  Makes me happy I don't shave my face.
*  It's making me think of Sweeney Todd.
*  It should, right?
*  Gilbert, did you have one?
*  No, every book I put on my list ended up on here.
*  Really?
*  No, I'm just kidding.
*  I mentioned Gone Girl.
*  I think Gone Girl is one that should be on there.
*  I put On Writing by Stephen King, which actually I thought would have appeared on this list.
*  But see, I think that the reason Stephen King isn't on this list is that he has so many
*  great books.
*  I think he got a lot of votes.
*  But when you write a book a year, the votes are going to get split.
*  Yeah, we actually should end by talking about a series that none of the books appeared on
*  this list.
*  People are a little bit surprised.
*  And I think it's because there are so many of them.
*  Ferrante has four books.
*  That's a lot of books.
*  But there's someone else that has seven?
*  Six.
*  Six, I think, you're thinking.
*  Who am I talking about?
*  You're talking about our great disgorger, Carl Ova Knellsgaard.
*  Six My Struggle books.
*  Six My Struggles.
*  Not a one appeared on our list.
*  And I think it's not because people don't like them, but because people just voted for
*  different ones.
*  But then again, look at how many series books we do have on the list.
*  I would just like to point out that Ferrante has two, Hilary Mantel has two from her series.
*  So you're saying if he had bundled all of them together?
*  I don't know.
*  I would have been listeners.
*  You can't see what I'm doing with the book would have been this big.
*  I don't think binding exists.
*  I just don't think it.
*  I think it definitely affected him.
*  I think it definitely affected Stephen King.
*  But I think in other cases, people who loved all the books look two of four Ferrante, two
*  of three for Hilary Mantel.
*  Shout out to Scott Turow, who put all four of the Neapolitan quartet on his ballot.
*  It was amazing to see.
*  I never would have guessed that of all the people on there, he would have been the one.
*  But you like what you like.
*  He loves all the legal drama in the Neapolitan quartet.
*  There's no rule of law in Naples.
*  Maybe that's what he likes.
*  It has been pleasure to talk about this project with all three of you.
*  It's been a pleasure to work on it over the past many months with all of you.
*  And I genuinely look forward to never speaking about it again.
*  So thank you for joining me this week on the Book Review podcast, Jumana.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  I had fun.
*  I don't know about you.
*  Scott, you did it first time.
*  I did it.
*  I'll be funnier next time.
*  You'll definitely be back.
*  Tina, thank you again.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  Please don't start another big project anytime soon.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  I guess I will promise on there.
*  Listeners, please do if for some reason you haven't, check out our list of the hundred
*  books of the 21st century so far as voted on by 503 writers and other literary luminaries.
*  You can find that on NYTimes.com.
*  Please do let us know what you think of the list.
*  Happy reading.
*  That was my conversation with Scott Heller, Jumana Katib and Tina Jordan, my fellow editors
*  at the Book Review about our 100 books of the 21st century project.
*  As I said, I hope you've had an opportunity to read it, to experience it, to check which
*  books you've read, which books you want to read.
*  We've taken our opportunity to share your 10.
*  There's a lot to do there.
*  As always, it's still true.
*  I'm Gilbert Cruz, editor of the Times Book Review.
*  Thanks for listening.
