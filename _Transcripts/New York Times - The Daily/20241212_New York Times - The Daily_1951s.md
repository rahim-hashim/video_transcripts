# How China Hacked America’s Phone Network
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3CL4l3AUhE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  An alarming new hack by China has penetrated the nerve center of the United States, our
*  phone network.
*  Today, my colleague David Sanger, on what the scope of this new attack tells us about
*  the growing power of one of America's biggest adversaries.
*  It's Thursday, December 12th.
*  David Sanger, you're back.
*  I am and delighted to be here.
*  So David, you are here today to talk about a hack.
*  And close listeners of the show will know that this is a topic you do sometimes talk
*  about on The Daily.
*  We counted.
*  You have done three shows on hacking in recent years.
*  But this particular hack, this one you're looking into right now, this one is different,
*  you say?
*  It is, Sabrina.
*  It's the big one.
*  It's from China.
*  It was run by the Chinese Ministry of State Security and hackers working for them.
*  It's got a strange name.
*  It's called Salt Typhoon.
*  But the key thing to know here is that this is a hack of America's telecommunication systems.
*  It's a hack of AT&T and Verizon.
*  It's a hack of all of the smaller communication systems.
*  What's remarkable about it is that the Chinese were able, by spending millions of dollars
*  and a lot of time, to figure out how to get into the core of what binds the United States
*  together, which gives them access to so much more.
*  What's really striking to me is the degree to which this has freaked out American officials.
*  The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner, who was himself a telecoms
*  executive in a previous life, told me it is the worst intrusion into the United States
*  he has ever seen in his career.
*  Wow.
*  Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, organized in the Situation Room a meeting
*  with the chief executive officers of each of the major telecommunications companies.
*  They dragged them to Washington and said, we are going to have to figure out an emergency
*  way to get the Chinese out of your systems and to rebuild those systems so they can't
*  get back in.
*  The critical question that this hack raises is, how could it be this late in the cyber
*  which have been going on for two decades, that China has managed once again to pierce
*  America's defenses?
*  Okay.
*  So this hack really shook Washington and also it shook a number of important American companies,
*  these telecoms, as you're saying.
*  Tell me, David, what we know about it.
*  So the first thing we know is that telecom companies were clueless for a year, maybe
*  two years, that the Chinese were in their system.
*  In other words, they had their radars off.
*  In fact, for some parts of their systems, they never had radars on at all.
*  And the second thing is that Microsoft researchers put the telecom companies onto this for the
*  first time.
*  The telecoms missed it entirely, but Microsoft noticed that Chinese hacking groups that they
*  follow were targeting these companies, AT&T and Verizon and many others.
*  And suddenly they realized that the Chinese were inside an American system and they were
*  the first ones to send up the alert.
*  Not only were the Chinese hackers there, they had figured out a way to go target some very
*  specific national security officials and politicians, including President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect
*  Vance.
*  Then they discovered that the Chinese could actually listen to some conversations.
*  Wow.
*  Were they actually listening to Trump and Vance's phone calls?
*  We don't know for sure what they listened to or whether they actually tuned into some
*  of those conversations, but American investigators seem to have a pretty high certainty that
*  they did.
*  And then we also learned that these hackers could read open, unencrypted texts.
*  That would be, for example, if you were sending a text from an iPhone to an Android, so it's
*  not staying within the Apple network and it's going out as an SMS message.
*  The Chinese could read those.
*  That's amazing.
*  I mean, that is really a violation of American security.
*  It really is.
*  And it tells you how effective they are.
*  And initially, the American investigators thought that the Chinese were just really
*  focusing on Washington and Washington players.
*  But the more they dug in, the more they discovered, no, they were in the entire system around
*  the country.
*  And then it got worse because it turns out that the telecom companies run for the US
*  government the lawful taps that are put on the phones of suspected criminals or spies.
*  Basically the way that the US government phone taps people that thinks they're spying for
*  other countries.
*  That's right.
*  The government can go get the warrant, but the government doesn't run the phone system.
*  So then they have to take that warrant to AT&T or Verizon or another company and say,
*  we need to tap this phone number.
*  Well the Chinese got in so deeply that they could figure out which phone numbers they
*  were listening to.
*  And then they could figure out, wow, they're on to this suspected Chinese spy and they're
*  on to this one, but they don't know about this third one.
*  Wow.
*  So the Chinese actually saw with this kind of see-through glasses they got in this hack
*  who the US suspected was a Chinese spy.
*  That's right.
*  So just think about this.
*  If the Chinese know which Chinese spies we're on to and which ones we aren't, it gives them
*  a huge advantage.
*  They begin to know if they need to send more spies in.
*  So there's a huge counterintelligence factor to the salt typhoon hack as well.
*  Interesting.
*  But to what extent does it affect everyday Americans?
*  Like should I be worried about it?
*  It's a great question because the Chinese have shown from this that they could get into
*  most of these ordinary phone calls.
*  The question is, would they want to?
*  They seem to be quite focused on national security officials, politicians.
*  Now I can imagine, Sabrina, that for you they may want to go in and figure out what's going
*  to be on the daily in a couple of days.
*  But in case they're not interested in that, they're probably not going in to listen to
*  ordinary Americans talk about how much milk and eggs to go pick up on the way home from
*  work.
*  But the fact that they have the capability to go do this throughout the system is pretty
*  shocking.
*  Now, there's an exception to this.
*  When you're talking on an ordinary phone line, the phone conversation is largely unencrypted.
*  But if you're talking over WhatsApp or Signal or even if you are talking from iPhone to
*  an iPhone or messaging between iPhones, then those are usually encrypted.
*  The Chinese would be able to see that there was a conversation underway, but they couldn't
*  listen in or look at or read the content.
*  Interesting.
*  So if I'm doing a WhatsApp call, then that is off limits because that's encrypted.
*  That's right.
*  And there are some encrypted conversations that with a lot of work you can pierce, but
*  by and large you're a lot safer on an encrypted line.
*  And last week, the US government, for the first time that I can ever recall, came out
*  and told Americans, you should use encrypted apps to communicate until we have this problem
*  solved.
*  Huh.
*  And that's a big change because it was only back in the Obama administration that the
*  FBI was complaining about encrypted apps because they couldn't listen in if there was a criminal
*  case underway or kidnapping.
*  Exactly.
*  It needed access to people's phones to be able to see what the conversations had been.
*  That's right.
*  And basically they've decided now because of the severity of this hack to reverse their
*  advice and tell Americans, go use encryption.
*  So how did China actually pull it off?
*  The best I can discern from telecom executives and other experts is they took advantage of
*  the fact that our phone systems are actually the amalgam of really new, sleek digital equipment
*  and really old, creaky equipment that's been sitting around for 40 years.
*  Okay.
*  So how does that make it vulnerable?
*  Because these old systems have been embedded in the telecom system for the longest time,
*  from an age that goes back before hacking.
*  And so there's almost no way to build modern protections into them because these systems
*  were built so long ago, it was before anybody had protections in mind.
*  So let me give you an example.
*  If you're going to do a banking transaction over your phone, you frequently get a code
*  that comes back from the bank that you have to insert first so that they're sure that
*  they're talking to you on your phone and you insert it and we've gotten used to it.
*  drives us crazy, but we all understand why we need to do it.
*  In the cyber world, that's called multi-factor authentication.
*  So it's something other than just your password to make sure that it's really you.
*  But inside these telecom systems, there was no multi-factor authentication.
*  So once they got the master password, they were in the system.
*  They were able to roam freely across the system without ever being challenged again
*  for credentials or identification.
*  Imagine this, imagine that you showed your ID once at the airport, but before you got
*  on an international flight, no one asked to see your passport one more time.
*  That's sort of what happened here.
*  So basically, these hackers kind of tried every door, found one that was open, and then
*  was never challenged once they got inside that door.
*  That's right.
*  But they did something even more strategic.
*  They realized that our systems were old and rickety, and they looked for the seams between
*  that old equipment and the new equipment because they knew the older equipment was going to
*  be their way inside.
*  Okay, David, so you've explained how this hack was really the biggest anyone in Washington
*  and you had ever seen.
*  It compromised really vital stuff.
*  I understand all that, but haven't the US and China been spying on each other for a
*  long time?
*  Like, is there a reason for us to think that this is actually worse than those other times?
*  We've been spying on each other for decades, and it's always been an article of faith that
*  we can hack into systems better than any other country can.
*  That's always been the assumption.
*  It was backed up 10 years ago when Edward Snowden, who you'll remember was a contractor
*  for the National Security Agency, revealed a huge trove of documents that exposed that
*  the NSA was getting inside the Chinese telecommunication systems, and particularly aiming at Huawei,
*  the Chinese telecommunications giant that's been supported by the government.
*  For years, the US government has been banning Huawei equipment from the US for fear that
*  if Huawei was inside our networks, they would have an easy way of diverting phone calls,
*  texts, all kinds of computer data back to Beijing.
*  So what did we learn here?
*  We've learned here that even without Huawei in our system, because most of Huawei's equipment
*  has been banned, the Chinese found a way in anyway.
*  And we've learned that at this point, they are essentially as good as the NSA.
*  No one will say this in public to you, but you get people off the record and they say
*  to me, David, this is the first time I've come to the conclusion the Chinese are completely
*  in the major leagues here, and they can do what we can do.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, how did we get to the point where China got so good at hacking?
*  Well China's invested in it, practiced in it, trained people in it.
*  And you know, it's like anything else in superpower competition.
*  20, 25 years ago, the Chinese were almost nowhere in space, right?
*  Now they've got space satellites that can grab our space satellites.
*  And the same is true in cyber.
*  It's just another area where they know they need to be able to dominate the superpower
*  competition in surveillance.
*  And the big improvements in their capability started after Xi Jinping came to power in
*  2012.
*  The current Chinese leader.
*  The current Chinese leader.
*  And you know, at the time when Xi came in, the American intelligence reports were, this
*  is not a man who is going to challenge the United States militarily or for intelligence
*  purposes.
*  He's got to focus on building up his own economic capabilities.
*  Well, it turns out all those reports were wrong.
*  And it was another of the mistakes we made in sort of assessing where the new Cold Wars
*  were emerging.
*  So he's the one who decided to make the investments in space.
*  And he's the one who has invested millions, if not billions of dollars in cyber capabilities.
*  So where was China in terms of its ability in surveillance when he came in?
*  They were pretty clunky.
*  They put most of their cyber capability into the hands of the People's Liberation Army.
*  It's China's main military operation.
*  You know, 10 years ago, I was writing about People's Liberation Army Unit, Unit 61398,
*  that was based out of a big white office tower near the Shanghai airport.
*  They had officers who would go break into American companies and try to steal their
*  secrets and their designs and bring them back to Chinese state-owned or other companies.
*  And were they successful at doing that?
*  Partly.
*  They stole the design for the F-35, the U.S. stealth fighter, and then produced one that
*  looks very much like it, but they make it a lot more cheaply than we do.
*  But along the way, Sabrina, they got caught pretty easily.
*  A company called Mandiant found them breaking into U.S. companies and were able to identify
*  the specific hackers who later got indicted by the United States.
*  There were wanted posters with these hackers' pictures on them, even though they were PLA
*  officers.
*  So like Keystone cops kind of thing?
*  Better than Keystone cops, but not the best cat burglaries you ever met.
*  So they started working hard on being stealthy, on hiding their tracks.
*  They began to study how the American systems work in great detail, and then they did something
*  even smarter.
*  They moved a lot of this hacking out of the hands of the Army and handed it to the Ministry
*  of State Security.
*  And what does it mean that it goes from the Army to the Ministry of State Security?
*  Why is that important?
*  It means that they're going to a group that has more money to invest on intelligence assets
*  that are trained at a higher level, that have the ability, because they're working in secret,
*  to go out and hire and train much more effective hackers who would not be caught as easily.
*  And they learned many more innovative ways to get into American, European, African, Latin
*  American systems.
*  They began to sell telecommunications equipment, as we were discussing earlier, that would
*  enable them to own the infrastructure and therefore get in.
*  And they learned how to be much more effective at stealing master passwords so that they
*  didn't have to actually write code and malware, but instead could pretend like they were legitimate
*  operators inside a system.
*  David, what's an example of the Chinese getting better?
*  If you think back to the turning points in surveillance in China, what's an example?
*  We are starting to get some context as to how big a massive data breach has been against
*  the US government.
*  I think Sabrina, the first time that we realized how good they were.
*  It appears the hackers based in China have broken into US government computer networks,
*  gaining access to information of federal workers.
*  Was when they got into the Office of Personnel Management at the end of the Obama administration.
*  This will likely be the largest theft of US government data in the history of the United States.
*  This is seemingly the most boring bureaucracy in Washington, right?
*  They are basically the government's HR manager.
*  And they keep the security clearance files for 22 million Americans who have secret,
*  top secret, compartmentalized clearances and so forth.
*  And the Americans who get clearances have to fill out these enormously detailed forms
*  that describe their financial condition, their medical histories, every relationship they've
*  been in, every foreigner they've ever met and had long interactions with.
*  So this is not just your name and your social security number.
*  This is the details of your life.
*  And obviously for Chinese intelligence officials, if they could get that kind of understanding
*  of the American elite who are working on every classified project, it's enormously beneficial.
*  And much as in this most recent hack, they were inside the Office of Personnel Management
*  for a year before anyone even knew that they were stealing the files, encrypting them and
*  broadcasting them back to Beijing.
*  Okay, so China is getting much better at all of this.
*  That extra funding and people and focus is really starting to pay off.
*  But big picture here, David, what is China trying to do with all of this?
*  Like, what's it really up to here?
*  Well, this is the great mystery that the CIA's new or relatively new China operation is constantly
*  trying to figure out, that the NSA is trying to figure out.
*  So there are a couple of theories.
*  The first theory is they just want a complete map of everybody in the U.S. who works in
*  the national security sphere and access to what they do.
*  So it's first of all for great intelligence gathering.
*  The second thing they're beginning to do though is learn how to plant their malware into critical
*  infrastructure in the United States that may enable them to turn off water pipelines or
*  electric grids if they got into a direct conflict with the U.S.
*  And we really saw this last year, 2023, with the Chinese hacking group named Volt Typhoon.
*  It's a different group than the group that was just caught inside the telecom system.
*  But their purpose was to be able to get into the utilities that feed American bases in
*  Guam, in Hawaii, on the West Coast, so that if there was ever an incident over Taiwan,
*  say a Chinese invasion or just a slow choking off of Taiwan, that the Chinese could use
*  the code they put in these systems to turn off the power or turn off the water and slow
*  an American response and ability to get troops to Taiwan.
*  And that's critically important.
*  It's also got a psychological element, which is if there was a crisis in Taiwan and suddenly
*  you were living in San Francisco and there was no water coming out of the tap, you're not
*  thinking about Taiwan.
*  Right.
*  You're thinking about how you get water coming out of your tap for your family.
*  So that's a huge step up, right?
*  It's not just surveillance in this case.
*  It's actually disrupting critical processes that are required for defense.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  And the U.S. discovered this midway through the Biden administration and through 2023,
*  there were all these kinds of emergency meetings in the Situation Room and they brought in
*  the heads of the utilities and they're trying to go clean out the Chinese malware.
*  But the fact of the matter is, Sabrina, you just don't know what you don't know.
*  And the Chinese are excellent at creating an access into a system, testing out whether
*  it could work and then pulling all the code out so that when somebody came looking for
*  it, they may not find anything other than a little bit of evidence that Chinese hackers
*  had been there.
*  Okay, so that brings us to today and to this salt typhoon hack, which you say is still
*  a problem because it's still lurking in our phone systems.
*  That's right.
*  And so I think to understand what has everybody so worried right now, you have to sort of
*  back up enough to look at these two different kind of operations.
*  So salt typhoon, the one that we've been discussing in the telecom system, gives the Chinese an
*  enormous surveillance capability and a chance to monitor national security operations and
*  whether or not we're on to Chinese spies and all that.
*  And the earlier system they discovered, the one that got into the electric grid and the
*  water systems gives an ability to actually disrupt.
*  When you add these together, you get a current surveillance capability and a perspective
*  disruption capability, right?
*  That what the Chinese can do now is listen in on President-elect Trump and national security
*  officials if they're on that open line.
*  What they could do in the future is shut down systems.
*  OK, so that's clearly a very serious problem.
*  What's the government doing about this?
*  Well they have begun to talk a little more publicly about these kinds of hacks and particularly
*  about salt typhoon.
*  That's what led to that warning last week that people should begin using encrypted apps.
*  But that's a band-aid.
*  It's not a solution, right?
*  If you are really going to fix our telecom system, you would either have to go shut it
*  down and rebuild it with something more modern.
*  Well, no one's going to do that.
*  We need it every day.
*  Or you're going to begin to make incremental fixes and then build a parallel system to
*  it that you can begin to shift over to.
*  You are going to have to go set real standards for cybersecurity.
*  Companies can't live in a world anymore in which it's sort of up to them how much they
*  invest in these because what we've discovered about the telecom system is on the one hand,
*  it's a commercial system.
*  It's owned by companies, not the government.
*  But on the other hand, it's critical to our national security.
*  So we're trying to balance a lot of different complicated values here.
*  One of them is keep the Chinese out of our system for which you'd want to design something
*  entirely new.
*  But the other is keep the US economy going and keep people communicating, which means
*  you're kind of stuck with the system that's been pasted together over the years.
*  It's not an easy engineering problem.
*  So David, just stepping back here for a second and thinking about this big picture, this
*  all comes at quite a moment of potential change.
*  We're just weeks away from President-elect Trump's inauguration with all of the potential
*  kind of change and chaos he might bring with him on China, on a lot of these issues.
*  And I'm wondering how you see it right now.
*  What all of this means?
*  So first of all, the world has changed a lot since Donald Trump left office on January
*  20th, 2021.
*  Obviously, there had been hacking and issues like this during his time.
*  The level of the Chinese sophistication and the sophistication of others, Russia, Iran,
*  North Korea, has gone up considerably.
*  And we don't know how the president's planning to go handle this.
*  In fact, whenever he's asked a question about China, his answer usually has to do with tariffs,
*  as if that's going to solve our competition with the only competitor who can take us on
*  militarily, economically, technologically, even culturally.
*  The second big change that was going on, the biggest change since President Trump left
*  office is that Russia and China, two giant cyber powers, have come together in a partnership
*  that is basically opposing the United States around the world.
*  You've seen it, of course, first in Ukraine, but we're beginning to see it in the cyber
*  world as well, because they want to operate by a set of rules that they define, and we
*  want to operate by a set of global rules that we define.
*  And the third big change that's underway here, of course, is artificial intelligence, because
*  that affects everything in the hacking world.
*  You can build much better defenses to hacking using AI tools.
*  You can also find vulnerabilities in old systems, like the telecom system we've been discussing
*  here, using those tools.
*  So we have a new arms race underway that's AI driven to go find or defeat this kind of
*  code in our systems.
*  And those big three things, Trump, the new Cold Wars, the arrival of artificial intelligence,
*  is leading to an entirely new era and some real brewing problems.
*  Well David, it sounds like we're going to have you on for more episodes about hacking
*  in the future.
*  Well, this is probably more the beginning of a conversation on the daily rather than
*  the end of one.
*  David, we look forward to it.
*  Thanks, Sabrina.
*  Great to be with you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he'll step down from his role in the
*  new year.
*  This is not easy for me.
*  I love this place.
*  I love our mission.
*  And I love our people.
*  My focus is and always has been on us and on doing what's right for the FBI.
*  His decision comes after President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to replace Wray
*  with longtime loyalist Cash Patel.
*  This is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray while reinforcing
*  the values and principles that are so important in how we do our work.
*  The FBI repeatedly investigated Trump, including by searching his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified
*  documents.
*  More details have emerged about Luigi Mangione, the man charged with killing the CEO of United
*  Health Care, Brian Thompson.
*  In a series of social media posts, Mangione described health problems, saying back pain
*  that had once been a minor issue got worse before having surgery last year.
*  Mangione stopped communicating with friends and family about six months ago.
*  His mother filed a missing person report last month.
*  Mangione, who was arrested on Monday in Pennsylvania, now faces a murder charge and has been denied
*  bail.
*  He's fighting extradition to New York.
*  Today's episode was produced by Stella Tan and Mary Wilson.
*  It was edited by Maria Byrne and Paige Cowitt, contains original music by Dan Powell, and
*  was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsferk of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tavernese.
*  See you tomorrow.
