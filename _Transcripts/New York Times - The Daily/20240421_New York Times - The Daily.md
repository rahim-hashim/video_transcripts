# Sunday Special: 'Modern Love'
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofnZ5VNXb4I)
*  Hi, everybody. It's Sabrina. Today, instead of a Sunday read, we're doing something
*  different. This weekend, we've got an episode from our colleagues over at the Modern Love
*  podcast. If you don't know the show, it's hosted by Anna Martin. And like the New York
*  Times column that the show is named for, the podcast explores the complicated love lives
*  of real people. Today, we're sharing an episode from Modern Love's current season. It features
*  Samin Nasrat, the chef and author whom you might know from her cookbook and TV series
*  Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. In this episode, Nasrat talks about love, loss, and how we embrace
*  joy. Okay, here's the episode. And if you want more of them, search Modern Love wherever
*  you listen to podcasts and subscribe.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. And we're still celebrating
*  our 20th anniversary, spotlighting our favorite love stories with our favorite writers, musicians,
*  artists, and today, a chef. Cooking for someone is kind of the original way to say, I love
*  you. The labor, the time, the care, all that chopping and kneading and careful seasoning.
*  So if food is love, then chef and writer Samin Nasrat just might be the most romantic person
*  in the world.
*  It's sweet. It's rich in flavor. Yeah, it's so good. It's so good. It's bringing tears
*  to my eyes. That's Samin on her Netflix show, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, freaking out in the
*  best way over some Parmesan cheese in Italy with the people who spent years making it.
*  This is Samin and her element, sharing meals and laughs and sometimes tears with other
*  people. From the vibrant, delicious dinner she hosts for her friends, to making traditional
*  Iranian dishes with her mom, with some trial and error. Apparently I've been doing this
*  wrong my whole life. You're not frying it. You're just making good crusty-taty. Okay.
*  To her instructional videos showing us how home cooks can make cheesy, molten lasagna
*  from scratch.
*  Hot. Oh my God. It's like a piece of lava going down my throat. Okay. I hope that you
*  get to share this lasagna with a bunch of people. I hope it brings a little joy and
*  comfort and deliciousness.
*  When we asked Samin to pick a modern love essay, she knew exactly which one she wanted
*  to read. It's an essay that involves food, of course, but it's also an essay about time,
*  how precious it is and how just like a piece of piping hot lasagna, we have to savor it
*  with the people we love.
*  Samin Nasrat, welcome to Modern Love.
*  Thanks so much for having me, Anna.
*  Okay. I worry this is going to sound creepy, but I'm just going to tell you we've actually
*  met before. We have a friend in common and one time I tagged along on an errand with
*  her. She was dropping off a pot she'd borrowed from you at your house.
*  Oh, for her chili.
*  Exactly. Yes. And I met you then.
*  Well, did I still live in my little apartment or did I live here?
*  No, it was like a house with a garden in the middle.
*  Yeah, that's where I live now.
*  And you gave me a LaCroix and I fangirled very quietly.
*  That's funny.
*  Okay, now that that's over. Before we get to the essay, I want to ask you a personal
*  question. You are so openly emotional on Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, your TV show and
*  throughout all your other work.
*  You have these moments where you laugh out loud or you burst into tears because
*  something tastes so good.
*  Have you always been that way with your emotions so close to the surface?
*  Hmm. I think yes and no.
*  Like, I think the feelings have always been there.
*  My family is from Iran and my particular family has its own story of loss and grief
*  and being affected by culture.
*  And so in my family, I was not necessarily encouraged to like express my feelings.
*  And so it's taken a lot of work, a lot of therapy, a lot of sitting with it and also
*  just like connecting back to who I am.
*  And I think part of that's just growing up, like I'm getting outside of constantly
*  worrying what other people think, which I only do it 98% of the time now, not 100%.
*  But I think instead of being embarrassed about the things that rise inside of me and
*  want to come out, now I understand that's all I can do and that's who I am.
*  And in a way, that's what draws certain people toward me, you know, as I like maybe
*  give permission because the thing tastes so good, right?
*  How can I contain myself?
*  You know, like I just, yeah, I don't, it's just it, I have to let it out.
*  It's so good.
*  And don't you want to share that with someone?
*  Totally.
*  This tastes so good.
*  I want you to have some.
*  I mean, your emotion invites us in.
*  It invites us to feel deeply alongside you.
*  So, I mean, when we asked you to come on the show, you knew immediately, which I say
*  you wanted to read.
*  It's called You May Want to Marry My Husband by Amy Krauss Rosenthal.
*  And you said it was because you were obsessed with Amy, that you were an ardent fan, that
*  you'd followed her intensely for years.
*  Without giving away too much of the story before listeners hear it, can you tell me
*  why you're so drawn to her?
*  I probably first encountered her work maybe like 2005, which was a time in my life when
*  I was reading a lot of blogs by artists and creative people.
*  I was really deeply unhappy in my own path as a restaurant cook and I wanted to become
*  a writer.
*  So I would sort of spend all of my time filling my spare time with like creative juju.
*  And I saw her book, I think it's called Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life.
*  It was a memoir written in this amazing format of encyclopedic entries, but of just ordinary
*  things in her life.
*  And I just thought it was so clever and smart.
*  And so I started following her online and she was always doing projects that invited
*  strangers in.
*  And so she had an event that she documented and turned into a short film called The Beckoning
*  of Lovely.
*  And the internet was already starting to turn dark, you know?
*  And it was this thing where it was like in time of so much darkness and disconnection,
*  like she was offering a beautiful way to connect.
*  I know that video.
*  I've watched it several times.
*  Amy Krauss Rosenthal called this project The Beckoning of Lovely, as you said, because
*  her whole sort of ethos was beckoning in, calling in light and joy and connection.
*  So she had all these strangers show up to make art together at 8, 8, so August 8th,
*  2008 at 8.08 PM.
*  Oh, I forgot the 8.08.
*  It was just this beautiful thing to witness.
*  This movie was so joyful and special and magical and innocent.
*  And like, I wanted to do things like that.
*  I wanted to be part of something like that.
*  It was so inspiring.
*  Absolutely inspiring.
*  Her work was so playful.
*  And the modern love essay she wrote also has that quality.
*  But at the same time, it is a total tearjerker.
*  Like this essay makes me cry.
*  Before you read, I want to pose a theory to you.
*  I feel like there are two types of people in the world.
*  There are the people who like a story that makes you cry, and there are people who avoid it,
*  like the plague.
*  And you, in picking this essay, you just went right for it.
*  You went directly into the emotion.
*  So I want to know, like, why do you think you're not afraid of the sad when a lot of people are?
*  I think sadness has always just been a part of my life.
*  And yet, like, you know, in my work and in the world, like, I'm so deeply associated with joy.
*  And you can't have one without the other.
*  I think my orientation toward joy is because I have so much sadness inside.
*  I mean, this essay has both.
*  It has the joy and it has the sadness.
*  I completely see why you were so drawn to it.
*  And I can't wait to hear you read it.
*  Okay, great.
*  You May Want to Marry My Husband by Amy Krauss Rosenfall
*  I've been trying to write this for a while, but the morphine and lack of juicy cheeseburgers—
*  what has it been now, five weeks without real food—
*  have drained my energy and interfered with whatever prose prowess remains.
*  Additionally, the intermittent micro naps that keep whisking me away mid-sentence
*  are clearly not propelling my work forward as quickly as I would like.
*  But they are, admittedly, a bit of trippy fun.
*  Still, I have to stick with it because I'm facing a deadline—in this case, a pressing one.
*  I need to say this and say it right while I have, A, your attention, and B, a pulse.
*  I've been married to the most extraordinary man for 26 years.
*  I was planning on at least another 26 together.
*  Want to hear a sick joke?
*  A husband and wife walk into the emergency room in the late evening on September 5, 2015.
*  A few hours and tests later, the doctor clarifies that the unusual pain the wife is feeling on her
*  right side isn't the no-biggy appendicitis they suspected, but rather ovarian cancer.
*  As the couple head home in the early morning of September 6,
*  somehow through the foggy shock of it all, they make the connection that today,
*  the day they learned what had been festering, is also the day they would have officially kicked off
*  their empty nestering. The youngest of their three children had just left for college.
*  So many plans instantly went poof.
*  No trip with my husband and parents to South Africa.
*  No reason now to apply for the Harvard Loeb Fellowship.
*  No dream tour of Asia with my mother.
*  No writer's residencies at those wonderful schools in India, Vancouver, Jakarta.
*  No wonder the word cancer and cancel look so similar.
*  This is when we entered what I came to think of as Plan B.
*  That's B-E.
*  Existing only in the present.
*  As for the future, allow me to introduce you to the gentleman of this article.
*  Jason Brian Rosenthal.
*  He's an easy man to fall in love with. I did it in one day. Let me explain.
*  My father's best friend since summer camp, Uncle John, had known Jason and me separately
*  our whole lives, but Jason and I had never met. I went to college out East and took my
*  first job in California. When I moved back home to California, Jason and I had never met.
*  When I moved back home to Chicago, John, who thought Jason and I were perfect for each other,
*  set us up on a blind date.
*  It was 1989. We were only 24. I had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere.
*  But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought,
*  uh-oh, there's something highly likable about this person.
*  By the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him. Jason? He knew a year later.
*  I've never been on Tinder, Bumble, or eHarmony, but I'm going to create a general profile of
*  Jason right here based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for like
*  9,490 days. First, the basics. He's 5'10", 160 pounds with salt and pepper hair and hazel eyes.
*  The following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels
*  important to me in some way. He's a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons,
*  Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him or just happen to glance down at the
*  gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes know that he has a flair for fabulous socks.
*  He's fit and enjoys keeping in shape. If our home could speak, it would add that Jason is
*  uncannily handy. On the subject of food, man can he cook. After a long day, there's no sweeter
*  joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with
*  olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening's meal.
*  Jason loves listening to live music. It's our favorite thing to do together.
*  I should also add that our 19-year-old daughter Paris would rather go to a concert with him
*  than anyone else. When I was working on my first memoir, I kept circling sections my editor wanted
*  me to expand upon. She would say, I'd like to see more of this character. Of course, I would agree.
*  He was indeed a captivating character. But it was funny because she could have just said,
*  let's add more about Jason. He's an absolutely wonderful father. Ask anyone. See that guy on
*  the corner? He'll tell you. Jason is compassionate and he can flip a pancake. Jason paints. I love
*  his artwork. I would call him an artist, except for the law degree that keeps him at his downtown
*  office most days from nine to five. Or at least it did before I got sick. If you're looking for a
*  dreamy, let's go for it travel companion, Jason is your man. He also has an affinity for tiny things,
*  taster spoons, little jars, a mini sculpture of a couple sitting on a bench, which he presented to
*  me as a reminder of how our family began. Here's the kind of man Jason is. He showed up at our first
*  pregnancy ultrasound with flowers. This is a man who, because he is always up early, surprises me
*  every Sunday morning by making some kind of oddball smiley face out of items near the coffee pot.
*  A spoon, a mug, a banana. This is a man who emerges from the minimart or gas station and says,
*  give me your palm. And voila, a colorful gumball appears. He knows I love all the flavors, but white.
*  My guess is you know enough about him now. So let's swipe right.
*  Wait, did I mention that he's incredibly handsome? I'm going to miss looking at that face of his.
*  If he sounds like a prince and our relationship seems like a fairy tale,
*  it's not too far off. Except for all of the regular stuff that comes from two and a half
*  decades of playing house together. And the part about me getting cancer. Blech.
*  In my most recent memoir, written entirely before my diagnosis, I invited readers to send in
*  suggestions for matching tattoos, the idea being that author and reader would be bonded by ink.
*  I was totally serious about this, and encouraged submitters to be serious as well.
*  Hundreds poured in. A few weeks after publication in August, I heard from a 62-year-old librarian
*  in Milwaukee named Paulette. She suggested the word more. This was based on an essay in the book
*  where I mentioned that more was my first spoken word. True. And now it may very well be my last.
*  Time shall tell. In September, Paulette drove down to meet me at a Chicago tattoo parlor.
*  She got hers, her very first, on her left wrist. I got mine on the underside of my left forearm
*  in my daughter's handwriting. This was my second tattoo. The first is a small lowercase j that has
*  been on my ankle for 25 years. You can probably guess what it stands for. Jason has one too,
*  but with more letters. A-K-R.
*  I want more time with Jason. I want more time with my children. I want more time sipping martinis
*  at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. But that is not going to happen. I probably only
*  have a few days left being a person on this planet. So why am I doing this? I'm wrapping this up on
*  Valentine's Day, and the most genuine, non-vase-oriented gift I can hope for is that the right person reads
*  this, finds Jason, and another love story begins. I'll leave this intentional empty space below
*  as a way of giving you two the fresh start you deserve. With all my love, Amy.
*  I mean, she was just herself the entire time she was alive.
*  She was just always a part of my life.
*  I mean, she was just herself the entire time she was alive.
*  She was just always and fully Amy Krauss Rothern at all.
*  I think that's what struck me when I read this and strikes me now.
*  More from Samin after the break.
*  Samin, thank you so much for reading Amy Krauss Rosenthal's essay. You did an incredibly beautiful job.
*  What did it bring up for you?
*  I remember when I first read this in the paper, I was surprised I had not seen anything from her
*  in a while. And I actually think she died shortly after, just a few days after it was published.
*  And so it came with that note. And it was just such a shock because she was so young and so
*  alive. Like aliveness was at the core of what I associated with her. And yet still in this
*  story, she's still so fully herself. And everything that I had been drawn to from the beginning about
*  finding beauty in the ordinary and finding ways to bring people together
*  comes out here. She's doing it here. She's inviting people into her life and her husband's life.
*  She tells the story of connecting with her readers and getting a tattoo. And there's just this way
*  where it's so deeply moving and so beautiful and so sad. And I think you just can't have one without
*  the other. You mentioned that in your work and your sort of public persona, you are known for
*  your joy, which is, I mean, your laugh is like a golden beam of light to me. It like invigorates
*  me. And I know so many others. And you're talking about the sadness too that you carry. And I guess,
*  I wonder how you approach holding both of those. You say you can't have one without the other.
*  I wonder how you carry both at the same time. I mean, I am a depressive person. I've been like
*  deeply overwhelmed by loss and sadness throughout my life. And even as I sit here talking, like I
*  can just feel the core of sadness in my heart. And also sometimes I have to wallow in it. And at
*  other times, I think it's just been a conscious decision for me. It's almost like a survival
*  mechanism that I can't stay there. I can't live there. So I can feel it and I can acknowledge it
*  and I can let it be there. And also the way I have to exist in the world is by looking for beauty
*  and looking for joy and looking for connection. And I'm not an actor. I wish sometimes I really
*  wish I could act. But the joy that I emit and I represent is also like very genuine. It's not an
*  act, but also I have to leave room for the other part of it. Because genuine joy and genuine sadness
*  coexist together. It sounds like you've come to a place in your life where you really
*  deeply acknowledge that. And in its own way, I think the essay does too.
*  There are so many beautiful things that Amy writes about her husband, Jason. And one of those things
*  is that he cooks for her. She writes, after a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk
*  in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese.
*  And I feel like you are the queen of this. I mean, sort of indisputably the queen of expressing love
*  for cooking, of wooing people through food. What is the last thing you made someone to show them
*  your love? Oh, I know Caesar salad dressing. With the real anchovies. Yeah, with the real anchovies.
*  Tell me the ingredients. I just want to hear you say it. It's like ASMR.
*  Literally. I'm going to bed to this tonight. I think that time I used eggs. Sometimes I make
*  the mayonnaise with aquafaba with the chickpea water. But I think I made it with like egg and
*  olive oil, a ton of lemon juice and lemon zest, ton of Parmesan cheese, ton of anchovies and garlic.
*  I always add a little Worcestershire sauce. And then I also add usually some vinegar too,
*  like white wine vinegar, salt and pepper. I think that's everything. Worcestershire,
*  is that like a secret ingredient? I never put that in my own. You know Worcestershire sauce is just
*  like white people fish sauce, basically. Say that. You can say that again. So sometimes I'll add a
*  little bit of fish sauce, but either one is just sort of a little secret kick. But I think it does
*  sort of go back to like maybe the 50s. I don't think it was in the original Caesar salad from
*  Tijuana, but it is a classic ingredient. That's a love letter, isn't it? That's a love letter.
*  How does food as love show up in your day to day life? I mean, to me, I think a lot about it as
*  time, you know, in some ways actually does relates back to this story and like, and also my own
*  sadness and loss, which is, I think a thing I've been thinking a lot about in the last few years,
*  my dad died and like, that was sort of just horrible to watch for a million reasons. But
*  a big part of what sort of washed over me when I was watching him die was how sad and horrible the
*  circumstances of his death were. And I kind of was left with this feeling of, this is not what I want
*  to look back on when I'm dying. And it sort of helped me really focus on what I want to think
*  about at the end of my life, which is like, I want to look back and see a life that was full
*  of friendship and joy and laughter and beauty and nature and puppies and, you know, art and connection.
*  And so there has been a sense I've always had in my life of, I think this has a lot to do with being
*  like an immigrant kid and having sort of save, save, save and work sort of the work ethic drilled
*  into me. But like, there's just been a sense I've always had of like saving things for later.
*  And, you know, I'll work really hard now so that one day I won't have to, or I'll save up all my
*  money so that one day I'll be okay. Or I'll say no to all of these sort of things that I could be
*  doing because I should be home working or doing something, you know, productive. And I think as
*  I watched my dad die, it finally sank in, like you only get one life and there's only the time
*  that there is. And actually the very most precious thing that we have is time. The only thing like
*  we can't get more of, the only thing I can't buy, the only thing I can't, you know, is time. And so
*  there was just almost this like overnight change in me of, you know, I always joke, I'm like, oh,
*  now I'm fully YOLO. But it is true. Like I say yes to, you know, when people are like, oh, do you
*  want to come to this thing across the country next week to be with your friends? I'll say yes now.
*  And so to go back to your question, like when that even has shown up for me in my cooking,
*  and a lot of sort of what I'm conscious of as a person who writes recipes and wants to encourage
*  people to cook is that time is really precious and that a lot of people don't have the time to
*  cook. And to me, I'm like, oh, if we can shift something in the way that we look at this thing
*  that we do every day to nourish ourselves and to nourish the people around us who we care about,
*  and understand that this time is a gift, right? Like I'm pouring my time into making you something.
*  And that is me sharing like my most precious currency with you. So it's not about making
*  the most like fanciest things. Sometimes, you know, I'll make like I make chili crisp,
*  and that's a project that takes a day or a day or two, and I make it once a year. And then I give
*  that away. But then the gift is more than just that jar. Like I'm giving you all of the time and
*  energy and thoughtfulness that I put into that. I mean, my most tangible thing that I do is that
*  for now, like, I think three or four years, a small group of my friends and I have dinner together
*  every week. It's truly our Sabbath, like it's our thing that we all look forward to every week.
*  Sometimes I'm testing recipes, but sometimes like we order empanadas. Sometimes we just have a pot of
*  beans a contoto. It's not like necessarily some sort of a culinary thing, but it's about creating
*  this ritual for ourselves and the kids and investing that time with each other.
*  Now I just talked longer than the essay, sorry.
*  And by the way, you just gave us the title of the episode, which is now I'm fully YOLO.
*  A conversation with Samin Nusrat.
*  Which is just like, perfect.
*  But what you're saying is so spot on and in a way it's so directly aligns with,
*  I think one of the takeaways from the essay is when she's talking about the idea of more,
*  she wants more time with her husband. She wants more time with her kid. She wants more time
*  sipping martinis. I mean, it's this idea as you're articulating of our most precious resource,
*  being time. And it almost seems too simple, right? But it's so true.
*  Amy Krauss Rosenthal died 10 days after this essay was published and her husband Jason later
*  published his own modern love essay as a kind of response piece to honor her. And in it he wrote,
*  Amy continues to open doors for me to affect my choices, to send me off into the world,
*  to make the most of it. And I have to say, you know, Samin, I feel like Amy has done this for
*  you too. What about this essay do you carry with you? I think the main thing that I carry with me
*  is the kindness and love and generosity with which it was written and the idea of,
*  I love this person so much and I want to give them permission to go have a full life. And I want
*  to sing the praises of them so that everyone else can understand. You know, in some ways,
*  she's not the main character of her own story. He is. And that sort of sense of generosity
*  and kindness is what I think of when I think of this, that even in like, as she suffered this
*  like sad, horrible illness, she was able to look outward. And
*  I think that's to me, like my loneliness and sadness often threatens to sort of pull me inward
*  and make me close myself off from the world. And this is a nice reminder that ultimately the best
*  way to be in the most fruitful way to be is to open up and connect.
*  Samin, thank you so much.
*  Oh, thanks for having me.
*  And we should say thank you to Amy Cross-Rosenthal for these words.
*  Yes. And thank you so much to Amy Cross-Rosenthal.
*  Thank you.
