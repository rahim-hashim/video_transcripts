# The Sunday Read: ‘The School Where the Pandemic Never Ended’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKBe7VVypl4)
*  Hi, my name is Meg Bernhard, and I'm a contributor to the New York Times magazine.
*  This is a story about grief, which I write a lot about.
*  But it's about a particular kind of grief.
*  It's about the grief of the world moving on from a mass trauma event when you don't feel capable of doing so yourself.
*  There's been a lot of reporting on how this moment in the pandemic is affecting people with disabilities, for example.
*  And I was curious about what the experience of moving on from COVID looks like for low-income families.
*  And in this case, a community composed predominantly of Black and Latino families.
*  After previous reporting, I became familiar with a school in South Central Los Angeles called 95th Street Elementary School.
*  Like in other poor communities in LA, families here have suffered disproportionately during the pandemic.
*  Vaccination rates are low, in part due to government mistrust.
*  Ninety-four percent of students live in poverty.
*  So for the Sunday read you're about to hear, I followed this school community for more than half a year,
*  as students, teachers, and parents grappled with the pressure to return to normal,
*  while still dealing with the physical and emotional fallout of COVID.
*  I first visited 95th Street Elementary on a sunny day last October.
*  It was Dia de los Muertos, and the first floor hallway was filled with paper mache crafts and altars
*  that students had made honoring their dead loved ones.
*  There was a trick-or-treat event where teachers set up their cars on the blacktop and opened up their trunks.
*  And kids would walk around in their costumes collecting candy.
*  As I hung around talking with staff members and parents, I could see that there was just a huge sense of loss in the community.
*  One woman told me she lost her sister during the pandemic.
*  Another lost her brother to suicide, which she attributes in part to the economic stresses of COVID.
*  Others told me about grandparents dying, about losing their parents.
*  There were teachers with underlying health conditions that made them terrified of the physical realities of this virus.
*  The pandemic, one person told me, just felt like funeral after funeral after funeral.
*  I thought about the family social scientist, Pauline Boss.
*  Back in 2021, I wrote a profile of Boss, who coined the term ambiguous loss.
*  It refers to losses in which someone is physically present but psychologically absent, or the reverse.
*  Situations of loss that are sort of unclear and defy our ideas of closure, like missing in action fighter pilots or dementia.
*  With ambiguous loss comes what Boss calls the myth of closure.
*  We have this idea that we can follow certain steps of grieving and then we'll go forward into our productive lives.
*  And at this point in the pandemic, we're hearing in culture and policy that we've made it through COVID.
*  So let's go back to how we were in 2019.
*  But for the community at 95th Street Elementary School, they experienced so much grief and death and illness and trauma.
*  It's difficult for the people I talk to at the school to map their reality onto this push for a return to normal.
*  And they're trying to find a way to make their own narrative.
*  So here's my article.
*  The School Where the Pandemic Never Ended.
*  Read by Samantha Dez.
*  At 7.30 on a crisp January morning,
*  Lakeisha Fell Davis was at the wheel of her car driving to Westmont,
*  a community in the southern part of Los Angeles County.
*  She was headed to 95th Street Elementary School,
*  where she is both a substitute teacher and a parent of two students.
*  Her daughter, Michaela, who was then nine, nibbled on the car.
*  Kevin Jr., her seven-year-old son, looked out the window at the succession of strip malls, body shops and liquor stores.
*  Surgical masks were tucked next to their seats, and disinfectant wipes sat in the central console.
*  Glancing at her children in the rearview mirror,
*  Fell Davis began a prayer for her children's safety.
*  But she couldn't help picturing the class of her childhood.
*  All those kids, all those teachers,
*  any one of them potentially carrying COVID-19,
*  and breathing the same air as she and her children.
*  Fell Davis was aware that at this point in 2023,
*  most people treated the pandemic as a thing of the past.
*  For her, the pandemic was a thing of the past.
*  She was a child, and she was a parent.
*  In 2023, most people treated the pandemic as a thing of the past.
*  For her, though, COVID still poses a real threat.
*  Fell Davis has type 1 diabetes,
*  putting her at higher risk of hospitalization and long-term complications from illness.
*  As such, her experience during the pandemic has shaped how she thinks about her daily life,
*  especially at 95th Street,
*  She worked on and off for more than a decade as a substitute teacher and teaching assistant.
*  A COVID diagnosis has potentially disastrous physical, emotional,
*  and financial ramifications for her family.
*  She felt much more comfortable when schools in the Los Angeles Unified District
*  were online during the first year and a half of the pandemic,
*  and her kids were attending virtually.
*  Sure, they missed their friends,
*  Ella and Kevin were both shy and soft-spoken children
*  who had never really strayed far from home.
*  They didn't seem to mind the arrangement.
*  And back then, Fell Davis' mother, who was paralyzed on her left side
*  after surviving stomach cancer and two strokes,
*  could visit them with relative peace of mind despite her poor health.
*  Her fears were confirmed in the winter of 2021,
*  when her husband, Kevin, caught COVID.
*  He was out of his security guard job for over a week with only partial sick pay,
*  plunging them into a brief period of financial stress.
*  Credit card bills were due, as was her husband's life insurance payment.
*  The entire family got sick.
*  Am I going to die? Kevin Jr. asked.
*  The pandemic had overshadowed most of his young life and took its toll on his psyche.
*  He would become agitated, sometimes crying,
*  if he saw someone who wasn't wearing a mask.
*  Even as Fell Davis assured him that he wouldn't die,
*  her bout with the virus confined her to her bedroom for three days
*  with body aches and a fever.
*  Horrified that his mother couldn't get out of bed,
*  the boy asked instead if she was going to die.
*  Fell Davis cried when she learned that in the fall of 2021,
*  LAUSD would require students and teachers to return to in-person learning.
*  Her home, a cozy two-bedroom apartment in a calm neighborhood,
*  had become her haven, the place where she had more control
*  over her family's health than she had anywhere else.
*  She was stressed about whether she might get sick,
*  but she was also nervous about the vaccines,
*  which the district had mandated for most employees.
*  What was in them, she wondered.
*  And how were they made so quickly?
*  But she decided that she had to go back.
*  Her husband couldn't handle the bills himself,
*  and while she preferred that her children learn remotely
*  for as long as the pandemic lasted,
*  she also wanted them to know how to carry themselves among other people.
*  To her son, anything outside the apartment was scary.
*  If he didn't have a mask on in public,
*  he'd put his shirt over his mouth as if hiding.
*  She didn't want to raise him to fear the world.
*  As Phel Davis turned down 96th Street,
*  parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles walked kids to the school fence.
*  The families at 95th Street Elementary were mostly Black and Latino,
*  except, teachers like to point out,
*  for the Russian family that enrolled a few years back.
*  Looking once more at her children through the rearview mirror,
*  Phel Davis reminded them of her rules.
*  Wash your hands. Wear your masks. Don't share snacks.
*  At 95th Street, 94% of students live in poverty.
*  Many parents work essential jobs and suffer from chronic illness.
*  The school and other poor communities in Los Angeles
*  have suffered disproportionately during the pandemic.
*  In California, where the earnings gap between high and low-income families
*  is among the widest in the country,
*  the pandemic has clarified inequality's consequences.
*  The life expectancy for Latinos in California
*  has decreased by approximately six years.
*  For Black Californians, four years.
*  In Los Angeles County, where Latinos make up nearly half the population,
*  their overall mortality rate has increased more than any other racial or ethnic group.
*  Among the hardest-hit areas have been East and South Los Angeles,
*  which are home to lower-income Latino and Black families who work essential jobs,
*  may live in multi-generational houses without room to distance,
*  and suffer higher rates of chronic illnesses, like asthma and diabetes.
*  In Westmont, 384 of every 100,000 residents have died of COVID,
*  compared with 113 in the affluent Westside neighborhood of Brentwood, near UCLA.
*  But elsewhere in Los Angeles and the rest of the country,
*  most people have embraced the return to normal
*  so central to the nation's idea of COVID recovery.
*  Before the start of the new school year,
*  LAUSD rolled back most of its remaining COVID protocols,
*  doing away with mandatory masking and testing.
*  In an interview that aired in September,
*  President Biden declared the pandemic over.
*  At the end of February, California's Governor Gavin Newsom
*  retired the state's pandemic emergency declaration,
*  and in May, the federal government is anticipated to do the same for the country at large.
*  Earlier this year, after protracted debate and delays,
*  conversation about California's adding COVID-19
*  to its list of mandatory vaccines for schoolchildren died down.
*  The burden of navigating COVID's risks now falls on the individual,
*  and what post-pandemic means for one person or community,
*  like 95th Street Elementary, looks wildly different than it does for others.
*  In the United States, more than 200 people are still dying of COVID every day,
*  and thousands are still being hospitalized for the disease.
*  Barbara Ferrer, director of the county's Department of Public Health,
*  has frequently acknowledged that inequality in experience
*  and warned that broad rollbacks of safety measures
*  do not signify that COVID has vanished.
*  For people who are at higher risk, COVID remains a potentially dangerous virus.
*  She says,
*  But for some people, it's absolutely not true.
*  I began visiting 95th Street Elementary School last fall
*  and found that the collective psyche of the community
*  had shifted from crisis to a quieter grieving.
*  By comparison, loss was acute during the pandemic's first year.
*  A lot of families lost not just one or two, but four or five, six people,
*  says Kirsten O'Brien, one of 95th Street's psychiatric social workers.
*  Teachers were de facto grief counselors for students, and sometimes even parents.
*  Many of them set learning standards aside.
*  Most classroom time was spent making sure their students were safe and stable.
*  Los Angeles parents fell into two camps on the issue of school reopening.
*  It was obvious that the school closures LAUSD ordered on March 16, 2020
*  set students back academically and socially,
*  and some parents protested and even tried suing the district to force reopening,
*  while others preferred not to send their children back.
*  The two camps often reflected socioeconomic divisions.
*  Many families, often from white, affluent neighborhoods,
*  wanted their kids back in person, according to a parent survey
*  the district sent out in the spring 2021 semester.
*  But families in low-income neighborhoods, where death rates were high
*  and vaccination rates were low, were hesitant.
*  When students did return fully in person in the fall of 2021,
*  the district imposed fairly strong safety precautions.
*  Anyone entering campus had to complete a form
*  a testing that they were not symptomatic for COVID,
*  and all students and staff were required to wear masks and take weekly PCR tests.
*  Laura Crespo, a fifth-grade teacher at 95th Street,
*  told me that for many of her students' apprehensive parents,
*  even if the weekly testing did not make them feel totally comfortable,
*  it at least prepared them to acquiesce to in-person instruction.
*  But once students were back, the depth of their loss was palpable.
*  That October, the hallways brimmed with photos, sugar skulls, and panduces,
*  Dia de los Muertos offerings meant to commemorate deceased loved ones.
*  In February 2022, Alberto Carvalho,
*  the former Miami-Dade School District Superintendent, took the helm of LAUSD.
*  Just after he started the job, the state retired its mask mandate.
*  In the fall of 2022, the beginning of the current school year,
*  LAUSD stripped back most of its preventive measures
*  and replaced them with the honor system,
*  requesting that only those experiencing COVID symptoms
*  or who reported exposures to COVID test themselves.
*  To the consternation of some teachers and parents at 95th Street,
*  gone were masks, distancing, and now weekly tests.
*  Some parents still sent their kids to school with masks
*  and prohibited them from partaking in activities like field trips.
*  Others, though, told me they weren't very concerned.
*  In this new phase of COVID, what constituted safety was still up for debate,
*  leading to a vague sense of disquiet among the teachers.
*  But Crespo, who has asthma and a combination of other undiagnosed conditions
*  that limit her respiratory capacity,
*  felt adamant that COVID was still serious.
*  In fact, I'd met her through a parent at another school
*  whose campaign to make and distribute air filters across the district she had supported.
*  Crespo was a popular campus figure who often served as an intermediary
*  between the school administration and parents, especially Spanish speakers.
*  She was born and raised in central Los Angeles.
*  Her parents were Salvadorans who fled civil war.
*  Accordingly, she was sympathetic to her students' stories.
*  Like most of them, she grew up poor and frequently changed homes.
*  When she was a child in Los Angeles public schools,
*  she felt that some of her teachers couldn't relate to or even understand
*  their students' hunger or financial struggles.
*  She wanted to be the kind of teacher she needed as a child.
*  So she noticed when a student seemed morose or agitated,
*  and she'd pull them aside to ask what was going on at home.
*  At the beginning of the pandemic, when her students' relatives were sick and dying
*  and they could hardly even log on to virtual school,
*  it was clear that the children needed to know they were not alone.
*  Many parents were still stressed about COVID, Crespo told me,
*  and asked her to make sure their kids were wearing masks.
*  She texted and called frequently to check in on their home lives
*  or update them on campus events.
*  Parents were grateful.
*  Almost weekly, a mother sends her child to school with homemade baleadas.
*  Others send tamales.
*  When I was at the school, a chatty girl or two often trailed behind her
*  as she walked campus during recess.
*  A gaggle usually ate lunch in her classroom.
*  In December, Crespo brought me to her desk,
*  which was strewn with hot chocolate packets from the class' winter party earlier that morning.
*  She wanted to show me a Google form she'd had students fill out
*  so she could get a better sense of their mental health ahead of the holiday break.
*  Crespo herself had never much liked Christmas
*  because she associated the holiday with stress.
*  Growing up, she couldn't understand why people would spend precious rent money on a dead pine tree.
*  On the form, she asked what the fifth graders found enjoyable and difficult about the season,
*  and six said they missed dead loved ones.
*  Crespo started sending mental health surveys to students at the beginning of the pandemic,
*  and the results spoke to the immensity of suffering in their community.
*  In total, 17 of her students had a loved one die during the pandemic's first year.
*  Later that day, she learned that a student had acted up during recess,
*  and she sat with him in the back corner of the classroom
*  while his classmates were working independently.
*  As they talked quietly, he revealed that his parents had died when he was young.
*  The loss became especially haunting during the holidays.
*  Crespo sent him to the classroom of O'Brien, the psychiatric social worker,
*  where printouts of candles meant to honor loved ones who had died were stapled to a board.
*  Scrawled children's handwriting on some candles read,
*  O'Brien told me she noticed that children had become extremely vulnerable
*  to emotional triggers in the wake of the pandemic.
*  A teacher would be talking about, say, a hamburger, maybe in the context of a counting lesson,
*  and suddenly a kid would burst into tears at the memory of someone in their life
*  who used to cook hamburgers.
*  Once the student left, Crespo told the rest of the class,
*  she was left to work on the next day.
*  Once the student left, Crespo told the rest of the class to notify her if a peer seemed upset.
*  As you're going through your day, she said,
*  please remember to treat everyone with respect, to be patient with everyone.
*  Just remember, you don't know what somebody's going through.
*  That same day, when Crespo was introducing a lesson on water and rivers
*  to a separate class of English language learners,
*  a girl confided that she had lost five people to COVID.
*  Crespo and the girl spoke in Spanish at the side of the room as classmates worked on their own.
*  The girl unspooled a complex story about not just the pandemic,
*  but also the violence she witnessed in Honduras before moving to Los Angeles.
*  Crespo told me that kids came to her because they felt they had no one else to turn to.
*  This year, though, Crespo resolved to be more mindful of the toll all this grief,
*  including her own, took on her.
*  Her uncle, aunt, and grandmother had all recently died,
*  and she wanted to focus on her own mental health.
*  She had recently taken up guitar and liked to strum along with her brother in their apartment.
*  My grief is very much connected to my students' grief, she says.
*  It's very much connected to my school community,
*  but I've needed time to just let my grief be its own thing.
*  The week before holiday break, the school's principal, Manuel Nava,
*  decided to hold the students' winter performance outside
*  as a precaution against rising levels of COVID, RSV, and flu,
*  and kids sang and danced to Christmas songs under a cloudy Los Angeles sky.
*  But the next day, the faculty had its holiday luncheon inside a small auditorium.
*  To his staff, the principal acknowledged he should be wearing a mask,
*  though he wore one only intermittently.
*  Sixty or so fatigued yet talkative staff members piled lasagna and salad onto their plates
*  and ate at long folding tables underneath white string lights.
*  Crespo, one of the few teachers to wear a mask,
*  filled Tupperware with food and ducked out early.
*  The only time she'd caught COVID was in that very auditorium last June.
*  It was bad. She was bedridden for three weeks.
*  But it could have been worse had she not already been taking steroids to strengthen her lungs.
*  She sensed that district administrators considered concerns like hers inconvenient.
*  And as she saw it, L.A. USD was more interested in academic achievement
*  and perfect attendance than in health.
*  She took COVID safety into her own hands by constantly wearing a KN95 mask
*  and encouraging students to mask as well.
*  Crespo's modeling seemed to work.
*  Most times I visited, at least half of her students wore masks the entire school day.
*  Her thinking underscored the complex reality at 95th Street and in the district at large.
*  The school was as safe as it could be, given its limited tools to mitigate COVID.
*  Administrators gave out masks and tests when requested,
*  and the custodial staff continued to sanitize every day.
*  But they didn't have the power to mandate anything.
*  As state and federal emergency relief funding has dwindled,
*  L.A. USD has pulled money for COVID.
*  Chronic absenteeism continues to plague the district, which affects funding.
*  State dollars are tied to average daily attendance,
*  and within L.A. USD there are sizable disparities in absenteeism between neighborhoods.
*  During the 2021-22 school year, just over 45% of students were absent
*  for at least 9% of the 180-day academic calendar, qualifying them as chronically absent.
*  Carvalho said that over this school year, attendance rates across the district were slowly improving.
*  A number of factors, including lack of safe transportation, housing instability,
*  and illnesses like the flu, affect students' ability to get to campus,
*  with the health and economic havoc wrought by the pandemic making attending school even more difficult.
*  At 95th Street, where more than 55% of students were chronically absent in the 2021-22 school year,
*  the rate is now 44%, funding can take some time to come through,
*  and approval for routine updates can be held up by red tape.
*  At the luncheon, Phel Davis and her kids sat near a few other masked teachers,
*  Kevin Jr. with a mask and Michaela without.
*  Phel Davis wore an exasperated look.
*  Why, she lamented, was it so hard for her daughter to put on a mask?
*  Like Crespo, Phel Davis was unhappy with the lack of safety protocols at work,
*  but she didn't blame 95th Street.
*  I feel protected, she told me, but at the same time she said that she felt completely vulnerable.
*  The most teachers could do was cultivate a culture of caution.
*  Sometimes, if Phel Davis saw a sniffling child with tired eyes, she would ask them to put on a mask.
*  She thought that by now, parents wouldn't send their children to school sick,
*  but she understood that it was difficult for families in which both parents often worked
*  and couldn't afford to stay home for a day.
*  In November, when she was substituting in a fourth grade class
*  and checking kids' double-digit multiplication work,
*  a boy told her she didn't have to wear her mask.
*  COVID is over, he said.
*  The children around him perked up and leaned in to listen,
*  so Phel Davis stood up and explained to the class that she had type 1 diabetes.
*  Just because everyone says COVID is gone doesn't necessarily mean it's safe for others, she told them.
*  As the kids lobbed question after question, eager to learn about their teacher's life,
*  she wondered about the boy's parents.
*  What were they telling him at home?
*  Some days, Phel Davis was more nervous about COVID, other days less.
*  Her views were rather capricious.
*  Though she never changed her safety routine,
*  her view on the severity of COVID's threat often depended on her mood.
*  For her, this stage of COVID is as much about grappling with trauma
*  as it is with confronting the challenges of the present.
*  The pandemic's emotional fallout is, to Phel Davis, even more overwhelming than the health risk.
*  Her mother died of septic shock in July 2021,
*  just before Phel Davis and her kids would return to school.
*  Instead of returning to work at school as she had planned, she stayed home for a year.
*  She couldn't bear to face condolences from colleagues,
*  and she preferred to untangle her grief in solitude.
*  Her mother had been her moral compass, the person she turned to with all of her troubles,
*  no matter how small.
*  Phel Davis fell apart.
*  In the mornings, after dropping her kids off at school,
*  she'd sit in her garage and weep for her mother.
*  Sometimes she didn't make it far from the school curb,
*  and her husband would go out looking for her.
*  This past fall, after a year at home mourning and collecting unemployment
*  to help her husband with the bills,
*  Phel Davis felt she was ready to return to school, but heartache still follows her.
*  Earlier in December, she suffered a panic attack at school
*  while she was preparing to teach a reading lesson,
*  and an ambulance took her to a nearby hospital whose hallways were overcrowded
*  with moaning patients, a setting that did not subdue her anxiety.
*  In February, as she was turning down her street,
*  she saw a parked ambulance, and her mind flashed to the ambulance
*  that took her mother to the hospital where she eventually died.
*  Another trigger, another day spent weeping.
*  I just want you to be okay, her husband told her after her panic attack,
*  when she was missing her mother and her anxiety was through the roof.
*  It's a daily struggle, Phel Davis says.
*  By mid-March, she was feeling more comfortable with the new circumstances around COVID.
*  But often when we talked, the darkness of memory and stress of the present
*  seemed to wear her down.
*  She'd spent the past three years entirely devoted to her family,
*  caring for their health and hearts.
*  I'm 41, and I need to do something that I enjoy, Phel Davis says.
*  I don't even know what I enjoy.
*  When I arrived at 95th Street Elementary again in late January,
*  the hills outside Los Angeles had transformed from brown to green.
*  White and yellow wildflowers pushed through the soil.
*  Some of the children were antsy on that balmy Wednesday morning.
*  I was a little worried about the children,
*  but I was sure they were going to be okay.
*  Some of the children were antsy on that balmy Wednesday morning.
*  Buses would soon take them to Point Furman,
*  an outdoor education center on the coast,
*  for a two-night field trip focused on marine science.
*  For many, this was the longest they'd ever been away from their parents.
*  The parents were anxious too.
*  In the front office, I heard a mother worry
*  that she hadn't packed her child appropriate clothing.
*  Some were stressed that their children might catch COVID,
*  but Crespo assured them that the camp and school
*  were taking as many precautions as possible.
*  Everyone tested negative before the trip,
*  and parents were comforted by the fact that she,
*  someone who still took COVID seriously,
*  was there to look out for their kids.
*  They were in the middle of district testing, with more on the way.
*  It was an especially trying time.
*  There were even four 95th Street teachers,
*  who were accustomed to working through the educational challenges
*  associated with poverty.
*  Everyone was exhausted.
*  The pandemic had left kids struggling to perform at grade level.
*  Zaira Velades, a second-grade teacher,
*  told me that many of her students were stuck at kindergarten math levels.
*  There's so much push to have these kids just have good grades.
*  Forget all that trauma they have gone through,
*  everything we have gone through, she said.
*  With double-digit subtraction, she has tried every trick in the book,
*  breaking numbers into tens and ones,
*  drawing visuals of the numbers so students can cross them out.
*  But nothing works.
*  Some rely on their fingers, which is difficult,
*  because they can't subtract from any number greater than 10.
*  They become frustrated, she becomes frustrated,
*  and they start over.
*  I get to the point where I've almost wanted to cry, Velades said.
*  Am I doing something wrong?
*  Crespo said her students were making gains,
*  but they were sick of testing and still struggling emotionally.
*  A lot of these tests aren't made by me, she said.
*  They're made by people who are not in my classroom.
*  She was trying to keep up with district demands,
*  but if the pandemic taught her anything about teaching at 95th Street,
*  it was that students needed to take it slow.
*  The trip gave Crespo and the kids a welcome reprieve from district testing.
*  Before the buses arrived at the school,
*  I sat in Crespo's classroom as students ate prepacked cereal
*  provided through L.A. USD's Free Breakfast program.
*  The walls were decorated to look like a lush woodland.
*  Marigolds and vines wrapped around an archway,
*  a fake willow tree branched out by her desk,
*  and green wallpaper created a backdrop to the class library.
*  As I spent time with her, it seemed as if Crespo had boundless energy.
*  She was also a United Teachers Los Angeles union representative,
*  had recently completed a master's in science education,
*  and was tasked with writing a new science curriculum for fifth graders.
*  But privately, she was feeling depleted from doing all the extra work,
*  attending to her students' emotional needs,
*  and constantly worrying about her health.
*  Most days, when Crespo returned from school, she didn't leave the house.
*  She was worn down by the accumulation of stress and grief,
*  grief for herself and for her students.
*  It's similar to a lot of inequality,
*  where I am going to keep working toward making sure that all the students get what they need,
*  that they're treated fairly, Crespo said of COVID.
*  I can only do what I can do.
*  No one is going to come in and give our students everything that we need.
*  COVID inequality was a structural issue like poverty in the school,
*  a problem that no individual could hope to tackle alone.
*  The constant anxiety was grating to the spirit,
*  and she was feeling absent in her own life outside school.
*  I'm starting to get desensitized, she said.
*  There's only so much worrying I can do.
*  Yet she couldn't stop herself from worrying.
*  There was so much to occupy her attention.
*  When I talked to her in mid-March,
*  a few weeks after California retired its pandemic emergency declaration,
*  Crespo and thousands of other teachers walked out of school for three days in solidarity
*  with striking cafeteria workers, custodians, and bus drivers,
*  among other low-wage workers seeking a new contract.
*  These workers, most of whom are part-time employees,
*  were the district's lowest paid, on average earning $25,000 annually.
*  Last month, their union won a new contract that ensures a new average of $33,000 by 2024.
*  On the bus, Crespo and the kids rode south for 20 minutes,
*  out of Westmont and towards San Pedro.
*  After they arrived, the kids spread across the campus, binoculars in hand,
*  for their first assignment, identifying aspects of the environment
*  that were similar to and different from their own neighborhood.
*  They giggled and zoomed in on their friends' faces
*  and looked at the snow on the mountains and a ladybug on a blade of grass.
*  This is good, Crespo thought.
*  It had been a long time since any of them had been able to do something like this,
*  to run around unburdened, if only for a few days.
*  It was yet another experience, that of simply being a child,
*  that the pandemic had taken from them.
*  On the second day of the field trip, after a visit to a salt marsh,
*  the kids trudged up a hill complaining, in the way that homesick children do,
*  about being thirsty and tired, asking Crespo when the hill would end.
*  At the top, they stopped and looked with awe.
*  Before this trip, many kids had never seen the ocean.
*  They stared at the light on the water, the immensity of the view.
*  Crespo and the kids fell quiet, taking it all in.
