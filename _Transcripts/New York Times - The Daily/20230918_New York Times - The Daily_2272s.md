# The Ozempic Era of Weight Loss
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNVmsUUhxqc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is a daily.
*  Ozempic and a popular new class of medications like it are revolutionizing the medical treatment
*  of obesity and the way that we think about and talk about weight.
*  Today, my colleague Danny Bloom on the story behind these drugs and the very different
*  experiences of two people who took them.
*  It's Monday, September 18th.
*  Danny, it is very rare to be able to say the name of a new pharmaceutical drug and have
*  it immediately mean something to pretty much everyone. But that very much seems to be the
*  case with the drug that you and I are going to be talking about today, Ozempic.
*  Yeah. I mean, I've never seen anything like this in my lifetime where people are tossing
*  this name around.
*  There is such a cool weight loss medication in the pipeline that I have to tell you about.
*  It is all over social media.
*  I got my Ozempic yesterday. I'm nervous. I'm not going to lie.
*  Another hockey mom, she's on it as well. She looks fabulous.
*  It's on TikTok.
*  You can't go on YouTube or even watch TV without seeing that really catchy Ozempic commercial.
*  Jolo, you look thin.
*  Thank you.
*  Ozempic?
*  Yep.
*  Everybody looks so great. When I look around this room, I can't help but wonder, is Ozempic
*  right for me?
*  It is absolutely everywhere. And it is so massive that it's something that I am thinking
*  about talking to people about covering pretty much every day.
*  So how do you explain why this drug has become the subject of so much chatter, so much conversation,
*  so many wheels on Instagram that I watch it one in the morning?
*  I think it's pretty simple. These drugs are really effective at helping people lose weight.
*  I should clarify first, Ozempic has become this sort of shorthand umbrella term for an
*  entire class of medications. But these drugs come at a really complicated moment in the
*  medical community and in our culture.
*  Well, just explain that. What do you mean?
*  So we know that doctors are excited about these drugs because they offer a potential
*  solution to what they have long viewed as a public health crisis, obesity.
*  More than 40% of Americans have obesity. And while there's an evolving conversation around
*  the link between health and body size, right, we know that you can be metabolically healthy
*  and in a larger body, we also know that obesity is linked with a number of really devastating
*  health conditions, cardiovascular disease, cancer risk. At the same time, we also have
*  an evolving conversation in our culture around beauty standards and body image. We've had
*  this thin ideal that is deeply entrenched, I think, especially in America. And over the
*  last decade, it seemed like we were starting to finally chip away at that. We had fashion
*  stores start to offer a wider range of sizes. We had celebrities embrace the body positive
*  movement. And it's not like this movement just totally neutralizes the thin ideal in
*  our culture, right? But you have real momentum. And then Ozempic walks in and just sort of
*  drops a bomb into that entire conversation. So, Danny, what is the backstory of this drug,
*  Ozempic, and drugs like it that are having such an enormous medical and cultural moment
*  right now? So Ozempic belongs to this class of drugs called GLP-1s. That stands for glucagon-like
*  peptide-1 receptor agonists. Doesn't roll off the tongue. Exactly. And so GLP-1 medications
*  start rolling out in the US for diabetes in 2005. And that's because they're really effective at
*  regulating blood sugar and insulin. But what patients and doctors also notice is they have
*  this welcome side effect, which is they induce weight loss. And then when pharmaceutical companies
*  like Novo Nordisk, the company that makes Ozempic, continue to develop and study these drugs,
*  they keep on seeing that weight loss side effect. So weight loss is not what this medicine is
*  at first designed to do, but it is a side effect that no doubt captures a lot of attention.
*  Right. And then in 2017, the FDA approves Ozempic, which is this once a week injectable
*  that people with type 2 diabetes can take. And researchers who study samaglitide, the active
*  ingredient in Ozempic, find that people who are on the medication for over a year lose around 15%
*  of their body weight. Which is a pretty significant amount of weight in a not very long period of
*  time. So how do we come to understand why the drug does that? So these medications are called GLP-1s
*  because they mimic this naturally occurring hormone that our bodies release after we have a meal.
*  And what that means is that these medications make you feel fuller, faster, for longer. They slow down
*  the emptying of the stomach. But what they also do is they target the brain. So the parts of your
*  brain that are hungry, that regulate your appetite, these medications directly affect that. And do we
*  know specifically how Ozempic does that? So we don't totally understand how it works. This is
*  something that a lot of researchers are working to untangle. But this isn't all that unusual,
*  right? We have plenty of medications that are pretty common, like antidepressants, that we
*  don't totally understand just how they affect the brain in the ways that they do. Got it. And
*  research has shown that if you stop taking this medication, it stops working, right? It's like
*  a statin or a medication for blood pressure. And so when people go off these drugs, they tend to
*  regain a lot of the weight. And in some cases, they gain even more weight than they had before
*  they even took the medication. And so because these drugs are newer, we don't have a ton of
*  long-term data, right? We just don't know what this medication does to you after 50 years, which
*  in theory is how long some people are going to stay on them. This is something that comes up in
*  conversations with doctors, especially when people are turning to these medications who are not obese
*  or they're not diabetic. When people are weighing the potential costs and benefits of taking a
*  medication like this, there are a number of open questions, especially when people try to take these
*  drugs for things they're not officially approved for. Interesting. So how do we get from this
*  approved medicine for diabetes that people realize can result in this meaningful amount of weight loss
*  for people who take it to this drug being used out in the world for that explicit purpose that has
*  garnered all this attention? The idea of a drug like this as an intentional weight loss treatment.
*  Well, people have been taking Ozempic for weight loss for a few years, but 2021 is when things
*  really start to shift starting in the summer when the FDA approves Wigovia for weight management.
*  And this is a medication that is really similar. It's a higher concentration of the same compound
*  that's in Ozempic, except this time it's approved for people who have obesity or who are overweight
*  and have a number of different health conditions related to that. And what happens is that there's
*  so much demand for Wigovia. There are so many people who are trying to get their hands on that
*  drug that then Ozempic becomes this backup plan. And it gets so prominent that people are seeking
*  out Ozempic because they're not able to get their hands on Wigovia. Got it. And even though Ozempic
*  isn't really meant for weight loss, the demand for it exists. And it sounds like there are plenty
*  of doctors who are willing to write a prescription for it even when the patient doesn't have diabetes.
*  Exactly. And most people who take these drugs off label, their insurance company isn't going to
*  cover a diabetes drug unless they have diabetes, right? So they're going to end up paying full
*  price out of pocket, which is extremely expensive. It's like around a thousand dollars a month.
*  So in spring 2022, you're starting to see these drugs go into shortages. Demand is so high that
*  diabetes patients are really struggling to access Ozempic. And this demand is also fueled by this
*  real swirl on social media. When people start talking about which celebrities are potentially
*  on Ozempic, it becomes this sort of detective game on TikTok where people are pointing to
*  different prominent figures and saying, you know, look at so and so, she dropped 30 pounds,
*  it must be Ozempic. That's part of how this drug becomes so popular. And then in the fall of 2022,
*  someone tweets at Elon Musk, basically saying something to the effect of like, hey, Elon,
*  you're looking really fit these days. What's your secret? And he tweets Wigovia, which, you know,
*  with all things Elon, people become really interested in this. So search results soar.
*  And this is the moment it really enters the mainstream in this way where Ozempic has become
*  a household name. Right. And at this point, the conversation around these drugs is almost
*  exclusively focused on weight loss rather than its original purpose, diabetes. Exactly. It becomes
*  synonymous with losing weight. And this is when these really important questions come up. It moves
*  from being this sort of tabloid fodder into the center of what I think is a really vital discussion
*  about weight and weight loss and health in our society. And we know that obesity is linked with
*  a number of really devastating conditions. But we've had this momentum pushing the focus away from
*  weight and instead focusing on one, making sure people are healthy, but then also making sure that
*  we don't have this really psychologically damaging emphasis on people being skinny, skinny, skinny
*  at all costs. And what happens when we have more people talking about these medications, taking
*  these medications, you know, is that we have the focus being put squarely back on weight.
*  Hmm. And this is something that people who are taking these medications are sort of wrestling with
*  in real time. As they're taking a medication that has a potentially profound impacts on their health,
*  they're also doing this kind of intellectual gymnastics and thinking about what it means.
*  And so I've really been interested in these questions. And because these drugs are so
*  widespread, there has been no shortage of finding people to talk to who are on these medications.
*  And I talked to two women in particular who I think really illustrate what it's like to grapple
*  with these challenges. And for both of them, they described these drugs as being life changing,
*  but in vastly different ways.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Danny, right before the break, you were talking about how many people you have spoken
*  with who are on these drugs and are wrestling with what it means to be on these drugs. And you said
*  that two women in particular stood out to you. So tell us about these women. Wendy. Hello. Hi.
*  So the first one, her name is Wendy Gant. So maybe we could just start off with the basics.
*  She's in her 50s. She lives in North Carolina. She works as a mental health counselor.
*  Well, this was last summer. Yeah. And like so many people, she found out about these drugs
*  on TikTok. And they really appealed to her because she had been struggling with weight
*  for essentially her entire life. I can remember always being a pudgy kid.
*  So she remembers going on her first diet when she was around 10 years old and her parents.
*  I remember they offered to pay me to lose 10 or 20 pounds, whatever it was.
*  They actually paid her to try to lose weight. I can remember in seventh grade, there was a diet
*  going around where you ate seven grapefruit one day. I think it was seven boiled eggs the next,
*  and maybe like seven bananas or hot dogs, something stupid. And she's spent a lot of her
*  life going through pretty much every diet you've ever heard of. And when she becomes an adult,
*  this sort of goes from being a mental preoccupation to a medical problem.
*  It was a wake up call for me two years ago, because my cholesterol was just climbing.
*  It was the first time I ever heard that my liver numbers looked irregular.
*  And the doctor basically says for the benefit of her health, she needs to lose a significant
*  amount of weight. And she's really frustrated about this, right? Because she's tried diet and
*  exercise, all the sorts of standard medical advice to lose weight, and it hasn't worked for her.
*  And then she's scrolling through TikTok one night. Women were talking about their Manjaro
*  journey. You know, that's what they would call them. And she sees people talking about Manjaro,
*  which like ozempic is a medication that is approved for diabetes, but can induce weight loss.
*  Their story sounded like my story. And so she's really attached to this idea of a medication that
*  can solve this problem for her right now. There's an option. I was like, heck yeah,
*  this sounds amazing. And what she starts to think is, you know, why don't I seek this out for myself,
*  I filled everything out online, I got assigned a provider. And she sees people talking about
*  a certain telehealth company that can offer them really fast prescriptions. It was less than 24
*  hours. I had the prescription submitted. And within 24 hours, she gets a prescription for Manjaro.
*  I took my first injection, you know, as soon as I got home, I could not get that out of the box
*  box enough and jab myself. And then pretty much as soon as she takes that first injection,
*  she feels different. I woke up the next morning. And my first priority was not going downstairs
*  and making myself a breakfast. You know, that that loop of have a good breakfast,
*  have a big breakfast, and then what are you going to have and to not have that food chatter on loop
*  is really freeing. She told me that it was like this switch just went off in her brain.
*  It was a sense of relief. And I thought, wow, I don't care about food. And I just went about my day.
*  What exactly is she describing as happened to her relationship to food when she starts taking this
*  drug? So something people bring up to me a lot is this concept of food noise, right? This like
*  constant low level chatter in the back of your brain. That's like, what am I going to eat next?
*  What's my snack? When's breakfast? When's all this? And for her, all of that just shut off.
*  It's the first time in my life that I've ever felt normal.
*  She didn't have that sort of rumination in her brain anymore. I kept saying,
*  this must be what skinny people feel like. This must be how normal people's brains work.
*  And for her, she was like, oh, this is what a healthy relationship to food actually presents as.
*  It reminds me a little bit of how people who take anti-anxiety medication describe
*  the noise of doubt and worry in their heads, the volume of that just suddenly going down. And by
*  the way, I'm one of those people, I take Lexapro. So that's a familiar concept. She's saying that
*  a kind of uninvited guest in her head is going away.
*  Yeah, I think that's a really good comparison. And for Wendy, without that sort of constant voice,
*  she was able to listen and sort of adhere to some of the guidance that doctors have been giving her
*  for her entire life. I've always tried to make sure, okay, I get this amount of steps. I'm going
*  to move my body. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that and stay active. But in the past,
*  it didn't have an impact on my weight. And now it does.
*  So she's more able to exercise. She's able to make those healthy food choices.
*  It's not as hard to want to eat vegetables or balance your meals as it was a year ago.
*  And what actually happens to her weight when she's on this medication?
*  So she loses a ton of weight.
*  She loses about 20% of her body weight.
*  She feels better.
*  So this was like a case study in why this new class of drugs is so popular right now. Wendy is
*  somebody who struggled with weight literally her entire life. And from what she says, this is the
*  first treatment that has made a measurable difference for her, her weight, her health.
*  But I'm curious how Wendy feels about these larger, as you call them, intellectual gymnastic
*  questions about self-acceptance and body positivity and what it means to now have a drug
*  that solves this problem for her in a way that never existed before. Is she grappling with any
*  of that? So for Wendy, this is the simple part.
*  Before she had this medication, that was when things were complicated. All of the
*  mental churning of figuring out what to eat and all of the self-blame her entire life. That was
*  when things got really thorny. But once she was able to access this medication, then it was really
*  the best case scenario for her. The weight was a medical problem. Her doctor had warned her about
*  it and she had a really effective solution. But that's definitely not the case for everyone I
*  talked to about these medications. And for the second woman I spoke with, things got a lot messier.
*  So tell us about the second woman you spoke with.
*  So her name is Renata Laveksavi. Hello. How's it going?
*  She's in her mid-30s. She lives in New Jersey. And at first, her story looks pretty similar to Wendy's.
*  And I've been one of those type of people who would exercise rigorously, control what I was
*  eating when I was eating. She's someone who has sort of desperately tried to lose weight for a lot
*  of her life. Either I'm losing my mind, or this isn't working. Like this is not possible. She sort
*  of felt like she was going crazy because she was putting in all this effort and not seeing any
*  results. And so she went to her endocrinologist and she got diagnosed with PCOS. It stands for
*  polycystic ovarian syndrome. It's a hormonal condition and it makes it really difficult to
*  lose weight. If you're overweight with PCOS, you can have some pretty serious health complications.
*  And so after she gets this diagnosis, she goes to see a nutritionist and she ends up with someone
*  who specializes in intuitive eating. Which is?
*  It's this philosophy of focusing on foods that make you feel better.
*  I sort of sounded so kind of like woo woo and like, oh, we didn't think about what you eat.
*  How is that going to help you with anything? But it really made more sense that it's about
*  taking the time to actually appreciate how your body is feeling before and after eating
*  different types of food. And so she still is keeping an eye on her health, but she stops
*  dieting and she stops moralizing food as good or bad.
*  I had no longer been like weighing myself daily or being obsessive over it, but instead trying to
*  look at other measures of health, such as how I felt, my energy levels rather than the number
*  on the scale. And she says that she reaches this really healthy place with food, with her body.
*  She's at peace and that's something that's come with a lot of work for her.
*  But then she goes to a doctor's appointment. Again, I didn't bring it up. I didn't say, hey,
*  doc, I really need something to help me lose weight. What can I do? She on her own brought
*  up to use new medications. Her doctor says, look, there's a drug called ozempic and it can help you
*  lose weight. Was willing to take the chance that if this is going to be beneficial for me in some
*  way that maybe I can't see, then I'll give it a shot. So unlike Wendy, Renata is not somebody who
*  is seeking out these drugs. She takes the advice of her doctor, who is the one who raises it
*  seriously and decides to go on it. Exactly. And she feels the effects of these drugs
*  almost immediately. I remember that day I was like, okay, this is it. Taking the medication.
*  This is your last hurrah. You better have a great big meal. And so I had a nice big dinner and
*  about 10 minutes afterwards, I took the injection.
*  And within an hour, I felt more bloated and full than I have in my entire life. And I was like,
*  what is happening? What is this? And I just felt so sick, so nauseous.
*  She had this sense of like, this is in my system now and I have to ride this out, whatever it is.
*  And so eventually she feels a little bit better. She digests her dinner, but that nausea stays
*  with her. This sort of like low level queasiness that never really goes away.
*  But what exactly is happening here? I remember you describing these drugs function as slowing down
*  the digestive system. So is that what happens here? Basically, she ate
*  a meal and it just took a really long time to digest.
*  Yeah, I mean, this is pretty much par for the course with these medications, right? It takes
*  longer for food to leave your stomach. And so a lot of people have nausea, especially when they're
*  first starting to take these medications. Feeling like the food is like right there.
*  You can't see me, but I'm putting my hand to my throat, you know, like right at your throat.
*  But for Renata, it's really severe. Like her house got messy because she was worried if she
*  bent over to pick something off the floor, she would throw up on the spot.
*  I definitely had a hard time eating anything that was protein rich because it's harder to digest
*  and therefore made me feel sicker. Yeah. So throughout all of that,
*  was there any point in which you actually had an appetite?
*  Appetite? I don't know if I ever felt hungry. There were times where I felt less nauseous and
*  like eating didn't sound disgusting. You know, if you don't eat for too long, you can actually get
*  nauseous. So what she ends up doing is actually setting a bunch of alarms to try to remind herself
*  when to eat. The morning would be me trying to force myself to eat something to lower my nausea
*  so that later in the day I could have a little more. If I didn't have anything or didn't have
*  enough, then the nausea would just get worse and worse and worse and worse. And then, you know,
*  what's the last thing you want to do when you're nauseous? Eat. So then it becomes like a cycle
*  that you can't break out of. So given all of this and sounds awful, does she stop taking this drug?
*  No. And even when she feels really fatigued, even when she starts having really low energy,
*  she keeps taking the medication. It just became like a, I'm putting so much effort into like
*  surviving each week that it felt like the longer you do something, the more invested you become.
*  It was sort of a sunk cost. Well, I'm not going to quit now.
*  So she kept seeing her nutritionist. And I was explaining to her how I was just
*  excited. She was sleeping over 10 hours and still feeling really tired. And the nutritionist
*  basically said that Bernada might be malnourished. Essentially, this medicine is making her eat so
*  little that she's not getting enough nourishment. Exactly. She has so little appetite that she's
*  just not consuming enough nutrients. All of it felt very bizarre. I'm still overweight.
*  And I only had lost eight pounds for months. Even after taking this medicine,
*  somehow now both overweight and malnourished. Like how does that work?
*  This really throws her for a loop because for her whole life, she's basically been told that if
*  anything, she's overnourished, right? She's overweight. And now she's on this medication
*  to do something about that. And she's not getting enough nutrients.
*  It was hard to reconcile that with how I know I look.
*  And I want to be clear that malnourishment is really rare, right? Like we're talking about
*  an extreme outcome. There are side effects that happen more commonly with these medications.
*  Novo Nordisk, the company that makes Ozempic, tends to cite nausea and diarrhea, vomiting,
*  all those icky things. But these are the sort of risk and benefit trade-offs that people make when
*  they're deciding to take the medication or deciding if they want to stay on it. Are the side effects
*  worth the results? And so Renata just plans to bring this up with her doctor at her next checkup.
*  But she expects that her doctor is going to say, stay the course and continue.
*  But no, her reaction was, this is appalling. This is clearly not a good fit for you.
*  Let's stop this medicine immediately.
*  And for her, it's sort of a worst-case scenario because she goes off the medication. She actually
*  starts gaining some of the weight she lost back. And this entire relationship with food that she's
*  come to such a delicate equilibrium about, it has gotten super complicated over the course of taking
*  this medication. Well, just explain that. What do you mean? So because she had to go through all
*  this effort to remind herself to eat, she was thinking about food all the time. Every day,
*  all day long. What am I getting in my next month? Do I have the food? Can I prepare it now? What am
*  I going to buy? If I go somewhere, will they have something I can eat? Right. It became having to be
*  obsessed with food in order to survive, in order to be able to eat enough food to live every day.
*  And she had done so much work to get to a place where she didn't have that sort of mental
*  negotiation. And I made a lot of psychological, mental progress on how I valued myself being
*  independent of my weight, trying to separate the focus of food as being something that nourishes
*  me and provides me with the energy I need versus good and bad, not looking at the scale. I had done
*  a lot of work mentally to get away from that type of toxic environment that's so focused on
*  weight, equal and beauty. And it felt as if by starting the ozempic, as if I was kind of
*  being untrue to that. Like, and now I'm taking a shortcut to lose weight because apparently I do
*  care about weight. It felt like I was undoing a lot of the mental work I had been doing to de-emphasize
*  weight. So, Dani, we are left with two very different accounts of what it's like to be on
*  these new drugs in their earliest days. But what seems undeniable is that whether these drugs
*  work, as they seem to have for Wendy, or whether they have not worked and had terrible side effects
*  as they did with Renata, that these drugs are going to be changing our relationship to weight,
*  both medically and culturally. Yeah, I think they speak to a really monumental shift, because for so
*  long, right, we've viewed obesity as a sort of moral failing. I think a lot of our culture speaks
*  to this idea of, you know, thinness is a virtue, it is something to strive for, and if someone has
*  excess weight, that is their fault. And what these medications do is they basically offer an
*  acknowledgement of like, this is a chronic condition, this is a disease, and what do we
*  treat diseases with? Medication. And so, from one perspective, these medications are a way to take
*  morality out of the equation. Right, because as with mental health, the availability of a treatment
*  says to the world, this is out of any one person's control, and it requires a medical intervention.
*  Exactly. But on the other hand, you sort of have this other thorny issue of like, if you can treat
*  obesity with a medication, and everyone knows you have that option, right, let's say in theory,
*  then what happens when you elect not to take a medication like this? What happens when you don't
*  want to deal with the side effects or you can't tolerate them, and you're left in a larger body
*  in a world where increasingly that is becoming almost an option? And so, I asked both of these
*  women if having this medication becoming more and more available, does it sort of emphasize
*  these expectations around being thin? Does it undermine the progress that flat positivity has
*  made? That's an interesting perspective. For Wendy, she's not really worried about the stigma
*  around weight getting worse. What my hope is, is that medical professionals who are the ones on
*  the front lines with individuals, that they can be more educated about what all the options are,
*  so that a person can make a decision based on informed consent, whether you want to take the
*  meds or you don't want to take a med. To her, the real problem would be someone who has struggled
*  with their weight not having an option to access treatment now that there is one that's finally
*  available. Not everyone who is psychotic wants to take an anti-psychotic drug. Not everyone who
*  wants to be in recovery wants to be an abstinent. You know, typically there's a reason why someone
*  makes the choices they make. But for Renata, she's very worried about the stigma this creates.
*  I just hope that people don't view it as, why are you still fat when everybody else is just
*  taking ozempic and losing the weight? That's something I think about, like whether it will
*  cause people to be even more judgmental of others. She's worried that what happened to her, that this
*  piece she worked so hard to create with her body and with her relationship to food,
*  that's going to get disrupted on a larger scale. And what Renata saw firsthand is these medications,
*  they don't work for everyone. It's more complicated. There are side effects. There
*  are other considerations. But if people don't understand that, maybe there will be a new
*  layer of stigma around being in a larger body. And what you're describing and what Renata and
*  Wendy are describing are ultimately questions of psychology and culture, and they're going to play
*  out over a long period of time. But my sense is that the companies that make these drugs
*  are focused on the huge market that now exists for them, regardless of how they are going to
*  fundamentally, as you said, monumentally change our expectations and our conversation around weight.
*  RENATA Yeah, the pharma industry is barreling forward with this. There are dozens of these
*  drugs that are in development. There are pill forms of ozempic on the horizon. There are
*  experimental drugs that are even more powerful. I mean, it's like the entire goalposts for what
*  researchers and doctors consider to be successful weight loss. That has all shifted. And what doctors
*  have told me is what we're seeing now is the kind of weight loss that they wouldn't have dreamed of
*  10 years ago. Now that's a given. And so more of these drugs are going to be approved pretty soon
*  for weight management specifically. And these medications are being studied beyond weight loss.
*  There's data that's trickling out about whether they're protective against cardiovascular issues,
*  whether these medications can treat addictions. And I don't think we're going to be able to put
*  the genie back in the bottle after this. It's only going to go broader from here.
*  Well, Danny, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  DANNY Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day. In a closely watched impeachment trial,
*  the controversial attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, was acquitted by fellow Republicans
*  over the weekend. The trial was a test of Republican Party loyalty. And whether in the
*  hyper partisan era of Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers would be willing to use the impeachment
*  process to oust one of their own from office. Paxton, a Trump ally, was impeached in May by
*  the Republican controlled Texas House over allegations that he repeatedly abused his office
*  to help a Texas real estate investor, who in turn allegedly paid for Paxton's home to be remodeled
*  and for Paxton's mistress to get a job. But on Saturday, Republicans in the Texas Senate
*  narrowly acquitted Paxton amid intense pressure from national conservatives, including threats
*  to run primary challenges against any Republican senator who supported Paxton's impeachment.
