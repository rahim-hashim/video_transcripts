# The United States vs. the iPhone
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8ptU0-dBMU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Last week, the Justice Department took aim at Apple.
*  It was the latest and most sweeping in a series of anti-monopoly cases against the titans
*  of Silicon Valley.
*  Today, my colleague David McCabe on the United States versus the iPhone.
*  It's Tuesday, March 26th.
*  So David, there was big news last week out of Washington, and that was that the U.S.
*  government filed suit against Apple.
*  And this is just one in a series of cases that the government is making against big
*  tech.
*  You know, the last time you and I talked, of course, Google was the one that was going
*  on trial.
*  So tell me about this case against Apple.
*  So for five years, the federal government through the Department of Justice and the
*  Federal Trade Commission has been pursuing these investigations and ultimately bringing
*  lawsuits into whether the biggest tech companies have broken antitrust laws.
*  And these are laws that are designed to stop companies from throwing their power around.
*  And they have brought a spate of these lawsuits.
*  They sued Google for abusing monopolies in online search and advertising technology.
*  They've sued Metta, which owns Facebook, for allegedly stamping out nascent competition
*  when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp.
*  And the government sued Amazon for allegedly squeezing the third-party merchants that use
*  its site.
*  While the individual allegations in each one of these lawsuits varies, the basic argument
*  is this, that these companies have illegally maintained monopolies or otherwise subverted
*  competition, that it's been bad for the economy, it's reduced choices for consumers, it's limited
*  innovation and it's led to higher prices.
*  And last week, the Justice Department filed one of these lawsuits against Apple.
*  And this lawsuit is in some ways the most sweeping we have seen yet.
*  It targets what is one of the most valuable companies on the planet.
*  Apple is worth trillions of dollars.
*  And it takes aim at the heart of Apple's business, a product that is recognizable to billions
*  of consumers around the world and has changed daily life as we know it.
*  And that's the iPhone.
*  So, David, the last time we talked, you taught me that simply being a monopoly in and of
*  itself is not illegal, right?
*  Like if lots of people like a company's product and it ends up as a monopoly because of that,
*  that's okay.
*  But if the company uses its power of bigness to keep competitors out, that's when a company
*  kind of crosses into the illegal territory.
*  So what are we seeing the government argue here?
*  That's right.
*  If a monopoly is maintained through exclusionary or predatory means, that's when a company
*  starts to violate the law.
*  And that's exactly what the government is arguing Apple has done here.
*  And particularly, the theme that they've hit on again and again is exclusion.
*  That Apple excluded other companies from offering products that compete with its own
*  services or excluded other phones or devices from interacting with the iPhone in a way
*  that was really good for consumers.
*  And that those things were designed to make a consumer more reliant on the iPhone and
*  make it harder for them to switch away from the iPhone.
*  And that all of these things built what the Justice Department is calling a moat around
*  the iPhone.
*  A moat, like a moat around a castle.
*  Precisely.
*  Yeah, filled with alligators, drawbridge, the whole deal.
*  Okay, so give me a better sense of this metaphor.
*  So think of Apple as a medieval lord of some kind.
*  Okay.
*  Apple's got its castle.
*  In the castle is the crown jewel, the iPhone.
*  And also, all the people use the iPhone, right?
*  Because that's the heart of Apple's business.
*  All the people using the iPhone, using the services Apple sells you through the iPhone.
*  And around the castle is this deep moat with the alligators, the drawbridge is pulled up.
*  And the moat makes it hard to get out of the castle.
*  It also makes it hard for competitors to get in and get at those users.
*  Got it.
*  Okay, so that metaphor is clear.
*  So what exactly does the DOJ allege?
*  So the first thing the government argues Apple does to build this moat is it simply doesn't
*  allow other companies to offer apps on the iPhone that might diminish the value of the
*  phone to users.
*  And there are a number of examples in the lawsuit about this, but the first one that
*  really matters is digital wallet.
*  So it has become increasingly common for consumers to pay for something like, let's say you go
*  to a coffee shop, to pay by tapping their phone against the little payment terminal,
*  right, rather than taking their credit card out.
*  In the iPhone, only Apple is allowed to provide a digital wallet like that.
*  It's called the Apple Wallet.
*  And the Department of Justice is saying that they don't allow other companies to offer
*  that kind of service, because it might reduce Apple's hold on iPhone users and make it less
*  costly for those users to switch to a different phone and take their digital wallet with them.
*  So that's one example.
*  And by less costly, you mean it would be easier to switch out of an iPhone.
*  Exactly.
*  The other way the government says Apple built its moat is by not allowing users to download
*  game streaming apps.
*  Okay.
*  What's a game streaming app?
*  A game streaming app lets you play a video game like you're watching a show on Netflix.
*  Instead of downloading the game directly to your phone, you play it on a remote computer
*  far away from you.
*  So streaming video games, basically.
*  Exactly.
*  Streaming video games.
*  And the government says that if iPhone users were allowed to stream video games, that it
*  would make the phone less valuable to them, because the iPhone has a really powerful computer
*  chip.
*  It can play games directly on the phone.
*  But if game streaming makes that unnecessary, the government says why would they need the
*  expensive powerful iPhone in the first place?
*  Got it.
*  So basically kind of trapping them in this kind of more expensive environment than is
*  needed for this kind of gaming thing.
*  Exactly.
*  So what else is the government alleging here?
*  The government says that Apple has also built its moat by making sure that the iPhone doesn't
*  work very well with other types of devices that aren't made by Apple.
*  And there's two examples of this.
*  One is the smartwatch.
*  So Apple makes a device called the Apple Watch.
*  It's very popular.
*  It tracks people's fitness.
*  It lets them respond to notifications and send text messages directly from their wrist.
*  People's wrists are beeping all the time now.
*  But other companies make smartwatches too.
*  And the government says that the iPhone works less well with those other devices not made
*  by Apple than it does with the Apple Watch.
*  A prime example of this is that users can respond to notifications directly on their
*  Apple Watch.
*  If they're using a non-Apple smartwatch, they can't do that in the same way.
*  And the government says that that's all an attempt to make it harder for people to leave
*  Because once they own the expensive Apple Watch, they're not going to want to switch
*  phones and the watch, right?
*  That would be much more costly, hundreds of dollars more costly.
*  The next example is messaging.
*  Right, the green and the blue like someone doesn't have an iPhone, basically.
*  Exactly.
*  So I have an iPhone.
*  And if I'm talking to someone who also has an iPhone in Apple's messaging app, the messages
*  are blue.
*  There are things like an indicator of when one of us is typing.
*  The videos that we send are really rich.
*  The conversation is encrypted by default, right, which makes it more private.
*  But if I'm talking to someone who has an Android, their messages are green.
*  You don't have things like that typing indicator.
*  The videos can be more pixelated, the government says.
*  The conversation isn't encrypted.
*  And the government says that Apple has designed this dichotomy, the green bubble, blue bubble
*  dichotomy in order to kind of create a stigma around phones that are not the iPhone, suggest
*  their lower status and that indeed non iPhone users suffer from a social stigma because
*  they don't have an iPhone.
*  And the Department of Justice says that this is particularly acute for teenagers and presents
*  data that like 88% of teenagers say their next phone will be an iPhone.
*  And the government quotes someone in Apple saying that making messages compatible or
*  more compatible across types of phones would just open the door to iPhone families giving
*  their kids androids.
*  Interesting.
*  So David, I have to tell you, this is the point in the episode where I admit to you
*  that I do not have an iPhone.
*  I have an Android phone.
*  And you know, maybe I suffer from social stigma.
*  I am one of those green messages in your phone.
*  In fact, I think I was this weekend.
*  But you know, I guess it was about five years ago, I just kind of stepped out of the castle
*  and swam across the moat and it actually wasn't that hard.
*  So I guess I'm wondering, you know, how the DOJ is saying that this actually harms consumers.
*  If you can just leave like I did, what's the actual harm?
*  Well, first of all, the statistics suggest switching rates are relatively low from iPhone
*  to Android that relatively few people have an iPhone and then they go and buy an Android.
*  So you're saying first of all, Sabrina, you're weird.
*  I'm weird, but perhaps statistically anomalous.
*  So while data suggests that not that many people switch, the government is saying that
*  Apple has a durable monopoly over smartphones in the US.
*  They're saying that by revenue, Apple has a more than 65% share of smartphones generally
*  and a more than 70% share of what they call performance smartphones.
*  So think about like high end devices from companies like Apple or Google or Samsung.
*  And that because Apple has built this very effective system, this effective moat for
*  maintaining that monopoly, that it does not have to compete with the Samsungs and the
*  Googles of the world in a full-fledged way.
*  And that the way that that harms consumers, first and foremost, is because they don't
*  have to compete on price.
*  That they can continue to charge high prices for the iPhone because there is an absence
*  of competition here.
*  So essentially the government is arguing that Apple by dint of having this, what it calls
*  monopoly, you know, this captive audience basically is charging more to consumers.
*  That's right. And the government argues that there are other harms to ones that might be
*  a little less material, but that Apple's monopoly might harm the possibility of future
*  innovations. That they're not allowing companies to go create an offer at iPhone cloud
*  gaming service, that they're not allowing companies going create an awesome digital
*  wallet for the iPhone, that effectively they're making it impossible for companies to go
*  out and invent new good things for consumers.
*  So the government offers one idea here, which is you could imagine another company, let's
*  say it's a bank or Venmo, would offer its own digital wallet on the iPhone and could
*  offer a benefit to users like cashback every time they use that digital wallet.
*  And if you play that out, there could be a competitive process where Apple offers its
*  own rewards to get people to use the Apple wallet.
*  But what the government argues here is that basically that whole process of competition
*  that leads to new benefits for consumers has been short circuited by Apple when it denied
*  the ability of other companies to put their own digital wallets on the phone.
*  Because the companies who would be inventing those new good things can't go to the main
*  platform they'd be selling it on because they're blocked.
*  Right. That they're denied from accessing that product to a big part of the market.
*  And so it's not worth doing.
*  So David, just listening to you lay all of this out, I mean, it really seems like Apple
*  is doing what every company tries to do, which is to make it hard to leave their own products,
*  right?
*  And switch to a competitor's products.
*  I mean, keeping itself kind of sticky.
*  But I guess I'm wondering, is that actually illegal?
*  Like isn't that just smart business?
*  Well, that will be the question for the judge who is hearing this case.
*  They will have to look at the arguments laid out by the DOJ, at the arguments laid out
*  by Apple and figure out did this cross a line, right?
*  From simply aggressively competing to something that was against the law.
*  And always these cases come down to two stories.
*  One that the government tells about a company that has perniciously stepped over the line.
*  And one the companies tell about how in fact they're providing benefits to consumers and
*  competing fairly.
*  And Apple already tells a very different story here.
*  It says that what the Department of Justice presents as this evil moat around the iPhone,
*  that bundle of practices, are in fact one of the company's greatest strengths.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, so David, you just said that Apple is arguing that its defenses, this moat that
*  they've built, that the government is arguing is unfair and illegal, is actually one of
*  its greatest strengths.
*  So tell me about that.
*  What is Apple saying exactly?
*  Apple is saying that the steps that it's taken, that the Department of Justice is painting
*  as illegal, are in fact designed to create an experience that consumers love and that
*  keeps them safe.
*  A major argument for Apple is that a lot of these practices are good for security.
*  And you've probably noticed that Apple has sort of marketed itself as a more private
*  option, a more secure option.
*  They run ads about the privacy of the iPhone.
*  They've gotten into a big fight with the government over encryption in the San Bernardino shooting
*  several years ago.
*  I remember this.
*  The FBI actually got the guy's phone, the phone of this mass shooter, but then couldn't
*  get into it because the encryption software was so strong on the iPhone.
*  Exactly.
*  And Apple is saying that that commitment to security lives in a lot of these practices
*  that the government is targeting.
*  A great example is the wallet.
*  So the way they exclude other companies from making digital wallets is they don't let them
*  access the physical chip that interacts with the technology at the coffee shop to make
*  the payment.
*  And Apple says they don't do that because they want to create the safest and most secure
*  experience for users when they go to pay for their coffee with their sensitive banking
*  information.
*  But more broadly, the argument that Apple is making here is that all of these practices
*  to control the system around the iPhone, to control the experience for users on the iPhone,
*  it's about creating a sort of magical experience for iPhone users where everything works together.
*  And Apple is saying that users love the end result.
*  They love this experience.
*  And then Apple is going to defend that experience from government intervention.
*  So Apple is basically saying, look, they're not trapped.
*  They can leave anytime they want.
*  They want to be here.
*  That's right.
*  And they want to be there because they love their Apple products.
*  Right.
*  They want an iPhone.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  So what about the top line argument that DOJ is making that Apple actually has an illegal
*  monopoly on smartphones?
*  Like you know, that Apple kind of has cornered the market.
*  So Apple says that's just not true.
*  So you may remember the Department of Justice is arguing that Apple has by revenue in the
*  more than 65% share of the total smartphone market.
*  Apple says, no, no, no, the way to understand this is as a global market because outside
*  the United States, iPhones are far less popular.
*  Androids are more popular.
*  And so Apple is saying, if you count the whole world, we have about a 20% share of the smartphone
*  market.
*  We don't have a monopoly at all.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  So Apple's saying, look, you've got the wrong universe, right?
*  The universe is not the United States.
*  The universe is the world.
*  That's where we're competing.
*  Right.
*  That's exactly what they're saying.
*  So David, how do we think this is actually going to go for Apple?
*  I mean, it's been in court on some of these issues before, right?
*  So what do those cases tell us?
*  What they tell us is that Apple fights back hard.
*  And when it does make changes, they're largely around the margins of the business.
*  They've not radically changed their business in response to government pressure or pressure
*  from court cases.
*  So there's a couple of examples of this.
*  One really contentious point over the last several years has been that the only way for
*  a developer to get their app onto the iPhone is to sell in Apple's store.
*  And if you sell in Apple's store, once you offer some sort of in-app purchase, imagine
*  a subscription or some other digital good that you buy in the app, you have to use Apple's
*  payment system, which takes a commission as high as 30%.
*  Now, Apple has a new high profile lawsuit on its hands.
*  The game developer Epic Games has filed a lawsuit against Apple.
*  And so Epic Games...
*  They make Fortnite and Fortnite is hyper popular.
*  Which makes the very popular game Fortnite sued Apple.
*  And they alleged that this whole system was anti-competitive.
*  Now the legal complaint seeks to establish Apple's app store as a monopoly.
*  Apple says you can't go around our system and buy directly from Epic Games, from Fortnite.
*  You have to buy through us.
*  They were trying to basically bypass the payment system, not pay that potentially as high as
*  30% commission.
*  Well, Apple stock tumbled a little over 3% today after a judge's ruling in the company's
*  court battle with Fortnite.
*  And the judge in the case did require Apple to use some of its restrictions on app developers.
*  Under the ruling, app developers will now be allowed to send users to other payment
*  systems.
*  But it wasn't all bad for Apple.
*  But the judge didn't make them abandon their business model entirely.
*  The judge also sided with the tech giant on every other key point in the case.
*  Okay, so that's kind of a win for Apple, although a slightly mixed one.
*  Apple did make changes, but they didn't have to abandon the Golden Goose entirely.
*  Right.
*  Another example is in Europe where...
*  The company faces fresh charges from the European Commission over its app store practices.
*  The European Commission fined Apple 1.8 billion euros in early March for allegedly thwarting
*  competition among its music streaming rivals.
*  And this was driven by complaints from companies like Spotify, which say that Apple exerts
*  an unfair amount of control over the relationship that they have with their consumers.
*  The competition commissioner said the company had for a decade abused its dominant position
*  in music streaming apps.
*  But it's an example of Apple fighting back.
*  They say they're going to appeal this fine, and it's expected that process will go on
*  for some time.
*  So this is again, rivals alleging that Apple is kind of abusing its privileges and bigness
*  with the app store, and this is being investigated by the European Union.
*  Exactly.
*  The pattern has been relatively clear.
*  Over and over again, software developers have accused Apple of taking onerous fees and
*  applying unfair policies to their businesses.
*  Apple has fought back.
*  When Apple has lost those fights, they've agreed to make minor concessions, but often
*  they have continued to push back and continue to fight.
*  Now all of this, of course, is the app store we've been talking about.
*  That's not the DOJ case, right?
*  The DOJ case is much bigger.
*  That's right.
*  So effectively, the kind of aggressive control that Apple exerts over app developers that
*  Spotify and Epic Games have been arguing about, the government is saying that Apple uses that
*  control in all kinds of different ways to build this moat that protects the thing it
*  really cares about, the iPhone.
*  Right.
*  And it's probably worth noting here that Apple says that they are changing some of the practices
*  that are laid out in this lawsuit, that they're going to make it easier for messaging apps
*  on different phones to talk to each other and become more permissive for gaming apps.
*  But it's unclear how those changes might impact the case.
*  David, how much of an uphill battle does the DOJ face here?
*  I mean, I'm thinking back to the case we talked about against Google, and it did seem like
*  quite a climb for the DOJ to actually prove its case against this tech giant.
*  Proving these cases is difficult, and you're dealing with a company with almost limitless
*  legal resources.
*  They're going to fight back hard.
*  And it will take a long time.
*  These cases usually drag on before trial for multiple years.
*  Apple is expected to file a motion to dismiss the DOJ lawsuit, so that will provide an early
*  sense of how strong the case is.
*  But the truth is, the current leadership of the Justice Department may not be in place
*  when this case finally goes to trial.
*  So they filed something that may well outlive them.
*  And how does that political change affect the case?
*  Presumably they'll continue it, right?
*  Well, a new administration could do what they wanted to with the case.
*  This investigation started under a Republican president, so it's possible a new administration
*  would keep things going.
*  But they could also settle with Apple or withdraw the case.
*  All those things remain options as they go to trial.
*  Got it.
*  And what is the DOJ's kind of dream scenario here?
*  I mean, what does it want to have happen with Apple?
*  So the Justice Department has asked first and foremost for the court to stop them from
*  doing the things described in the lawsuit.
*  Stop them from excluding certain types of apps or making certain products less compatible
*  with the iPhone than Apple's own products.
*  But the devil will really be in the details of the judge's ruling.
*  If the judge rules that Apple broke the law in a lot of different ways, that may influence
*  how the Department of Justice ultimately asks the judge to fix matters in this case.
*  So they could ask for changes to Apple's behavior.
*  They could ask for changes to the structure of Apple.
*  But they really are holding their cards fairly close to the vest while they wait to see how
*  a court rules on the substance of the allegations.
*  So David, I just want to step back here for a second and really kind of think about what
*  the government is doing here.
*  It's taking one of the single most valuable companies in the world and it's trying to
*  fundamentally change the way that company operates.
*  I mean, that strikes me as kind of a potentially risky thing to do, right?
*  It could be very damaging to this valuable American company and as a result to the US
*  economy.
*  Well, the government says that it's worth it, that enforcing the competition laws in
*  this country is good for the economy.
*  They've really leaned on the justice form, its long litigation with Microsoft at the
*  turn of this century.
*  Basically, they've been arguing that Microsoft was forced to allow things like Apple's own
*  iTunes product onto Windows.
*  And as a result, it opened the door for Apple to build this whole ecosystem that resulted
*  in the iPhone.
*  So what the government believes is that, yes, they are accusing a major company of wrongdoing,
*  but that in doing so, they will open the door to innovations that we can't even conceive
*  of.
*  So there would be a net benefit for both American society and for the economy.
*  Right.
*  But David, there's an interesting tension here, right?
*  I mean, of course, the government is arguing that all of these things are in service of
*  a better, brighter future in the American economy.
*  But a lot of people would say they choose Apple products because they like them better.
*  Like they like Apple's ecosystem.
*  They like being in the castle.
*  So I guess there's a real contrast there with what the government's trying to do, because
*  fundamentally, at the end of the day, this company is quite popular with consumers.
*  Well, and the government presents itself first and foremost as a law enforcement agency.
*  That here is a company that, regardless of how popular its products are, has broken the
*  law and needs to be held to account.
*  But this is a really fascinating moment for reasons that go beyond any one case.
*  Think about what's happened here.
*  The government has filed lawsuits against the biggest defining American tech companies
*  of our era.
*  And it's promising that this will lead to an era of new innovation, of better choices
*  for consumers, even lower prices.
*  And now we're going to see whether or not they were right.
*  And consumers will see it in the way that these products change, in the way that this
*  so many aspects of American life operates going forward.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.
*  On Monday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for an immediate
*  ceasefire in Gaza, breaking a five-month impasse in which the United States vetoed multiple
*  calls for a halt to the fighting.
*  The U.S. abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass.
*  The result of the voting is as follows.
*  14 votes in favor, zero vote against, one abstention.
*  The draft resolution has been adopted at Resolution 27-28, 2024.
*  The U.S. faced immediate criticism from Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who canceled
*  meetings in Washington between an Israeli delegation and U.S. officials, a public rebuke
*  to President Biden, who had asked for the meetings.
*  And President Vladimir Putin of Russia acknowledged for the first time that the bloody assault
*  on a concert hall near Moscow was executed by, quote, radical Islamists.
*  However, he continued to assert that Ukraine probably played a role.
*  Putin said that the tragedy was likely ordered by Ukraine, asserting that the assailants
*  were on their way there after their attack, and saying, quote, the question is, who benefited
*  from it?
*  Finally, Donald Trump is all but certain to become the first former U.S. president to
*  stand trial on criminal charges after a judge on Monday denied his effort to delay the
*  proceedings.
*  The trial, in which Trump will be accused of orchestrating the cover-up of a sex scandal
*  surrounding his 2016 presidential campaign, will begin on April 15th.
